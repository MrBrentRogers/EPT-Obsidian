Intrigues are best made from a DM immersed in a world. Perhaps the DM has played awhile in another campaign, perhaps they take turns DMg in the same world. Here are a couple of examples for Tekumel.com and the Empire of the Petal Throne. The DM is advised to learn a basic amount at the website above, then read on! 

20 years ago, Hlucha Tlakotani m a member of the 12th imperial light infantry, saw a comrade hauled off to the pits for imprisonment. She was at the time a training sergeant, and though she wondered why the person was not executed by a military court outright, but taken for torture or some other thing, it wasn't her job. 

Her own travels ended her in trouble with a (Tlakotani) prince of Sarku who was in the habit of sacrificing Tlakotani in a fit of pique with his failure to become emperor. She barely escaped the pits herself and learned just why they are there for spoiled royals.  Again, a civil war started by the Sarku Prince delayed her, she supported the right side (Kettukal) and the worm Prince of Sarku was no more. Along the way she obtained a sword of the goddess Avanthe that generated some nice politics and got her promoted. Eventually as **General Hlucha** **hiTlakotani** of the 41st Imperial Archers, winner of the Second Battle of R'y,  she investigated. 

Hlucha conditionally married the girl that had spent 20 years in the pits. (Well she has a Tlakotani body...mine) Unfortunately the girl was dying and Hlucha had her re-embodied in a clone of Hlucha herself (you can't make this stuff up, another adventure away back). The girl, Ardari knew the truth about the reason she was in the pits. She told Hlucha the story. Here hatches the intrigue. 

Ardari was given a sword and ring that she could store "around the corner" at her katunjalim. (Coming of age) She was enrolled in the 12th imperial light infantry as a training sergeant like Hlucha. As a gift, her clan gave her a magical sheath (her sword and ring remained secret) from which the sword drawn cannot be broken. 

Almost as soon as she started she was falsely accused of an assassination plot against the general of the legion. Normally this would be execution, but the accusers persuaded the court to have her sent to the pits to question about other agents in the plot. They of course worked for allies of the Sarku Prince who knew more than they! 

Sarku's Prince had no need to question her, the plot was his. He had learned that she was a secret Tlakotani Princess and would make him a fine mate. She used her hidden sword to escape into the Ultimate Labyrinth of the pits, taking some slaves and prisoners with her. They held out and got lost for 20 years until Hlucha found her, dying. The re embodiment has ruined her as a princess (she secretly renounces the gold to Hlucha) but she is definitely not forgotten by the Tlakotani Clan (they kill failed princesses) and her marriage is a happy ending only if she can tie up this loose end! Sea Blue Clan members are still talking with the bureaucracy to find her identity, "lost" in the pits. (Ardari Tlakotani from 1200 years past? Nope, try again) So far.

Her training with Hlucha is complete and she must now achieve mastery of the School of The House Which Has No Fear. Promoted to Captain she leads a cohort of 400 troops of the 41st Archers to the NW border for a cadre mission. She will visit the Grandmaster of the School on the way, there is little doubt that she will be granted mastery. So it appears on the surface. 

In reality she is required to reclaim the scabbard held in her old legions Armory for the secret symbols within that will prove her claim to royalty. If she can also get the traitors from years before killed (assuming the wars left them alive) that's gravy. The cultivation of various factions has taken years- Hlucha wants the scabbard for her own blade of course! The Girdle of Purity Society sets up this intrigue. They provide the General with plausible deniability (the pits lied, record muddled) and gain a greater hold over the general. 

1- Tlakotani Clan has been encouraged to send major players, none of whom know the truths above. They can be royals and help with negotiation and feasting. 

2- Sea Blue Clan@ the HQ of the 41st has been weakened by popping in a lot of youngsters "elevated" for service to the Empire. These are obfuscating the identity of Ardari by sheer incompetence. ("She has to be from the Hekellu clan!" "Wait there isn't such a branch...")

3- Vimuhla Clans are appeased by -2- above (they distrust Sea Blue Factions) and less watchful, a prerequisite as the Emperor is of Vimuhla. For reasons of security the claimant Ardari must secretly get proof and go to the throne, without others killing her. (The emperor could still execute her but them's the risks) in addition, the political waters are muddled with governors that asked for strange tasks, raids on the border, etc.

**Details**

A Tour---The action starts at Tu'umnra, base of the 12th light infantry. The Tlakotani are encouraged to undertake a tour of the ancient barracks and see the magical pennons, holy weapons, scabbards...(hint hint)

The Party---Assuming they detect the right scabbard (they are given a description) they can then learn its provenance and negotiate for it (a nice jewelled case, too bad a traitor owned it, I can put it in my collection and donate to your legion...!) during a celebratory party for receiving good wine or something! Failing this they can find other means, and should watch for the traitors from decades ago in case they surface (this part told to them after the tour)

At the showdown.--- A number of things can happen here, not the least of which is a Tlakotani brat insulting the traitor and asking Kasi Ardari to represent them in a duel! (She'd love to!) 

Depending on the DM the North Frontier campaign can be brought in, with the various surviving legions sending people to a party, Kettukal of Sea Blue sending along some interesting orders and the Girdle of Purity facing off against old Yan Koryani traitors deeply imbedded in the 12th! The general of the 12th is the high priestess of the empires religion of Dilinala, the Guardians of Purity (and the Sisterhood of the Cerulean Flower, not to mention Karakan societies) have reason to see her live! Fun.

A- he'esa of Yan Kor as the allies of the Sarku Prince (shape changers replaced regularly as this or that book destroys them.)

B-Baron Ald remembers the plot (oh boy) 

C- Sarku leftovers as jajgi  etc, interfere or are the traitors. 

(Choose one or all for advanced parties!)

The **Truth**

The girl Ardari is Tlakotani, but not a princess. She was a decoy raised in a nice clan and on her katunjalim enrolled in a legion (12th). Sarku Prince and Baron Ald fell for it, capturing her as above instead of Princess Arimala. She is sent back as General Hlucha's  wife with the scabbard as her reward. 

General Hlucha is pleased.
