I stress that this 'North Campaign' is from Canada, not Yan Kor as many would think...(thanks to Professor Barker for the help and the use of the sword)

Centuries ago, the Tlakotani lady Janule wielded a mighty sword in her quest for the Petal Throne. She succeeded in the quest. Later it was made known that the sword was the 'Sword of Avanthe', a blade that had been crafted for the defense of the Goddess herself at the battle of Dormoron Plain. As Avanthe would not normally wield a weapon, the blade required a wielder and bearer. Janule was the first to bear it in millenia.

The blade disappeared then, for such a sword would be sought by many of the dark gods in order to corrupt it to their own uses. It resurfaces in the later years of the Reign of Emperor HIrkane and is wielded by a powerful lady of the Tlakotani Clan in defense of the Empire against foul machinations by the worm Prince Dhich'une.

During the Civil War the blade again surfaces, as a champion appears with it, offering to help the scions of the Emperor in their quest for the Petal Throne. Eventually the throne is won by Miruseya, and the champion of the blade is sent to the Western Frontier to oppose the Mu'ugalavyani. General of the 41st Imperial Archers, the champion is based at R’y.

This is where the players come in. They are on the retinue of the champion. Although the Sword of Janule (aka Sword of Avanthe) is a powerful item, giving invulnerability for a short time against those things that Avanthe opposes, it is limited in its uses. The sword may have other powers, but the imperfections of any human disallow the ability to use them at will. Even the champion, a fanatic Aridani, needs help. Thus enemies can overcome the champion by using traitors and beasts that the sword cannot affect.  
This is the setting of the campaign as the players strive against Pe Choi ambushes, Mu'ugalavyani war parties, Ito Clan evil and many dangers in the Jungles of the Chakas (as well as traitors among their own people).  
More as the situation develops...

2019 - Notes from [Bill]

Livyánu rocks when crushed and made into a tar instead of canceling spellcasting, it blocks the effects of metal on spellcasting.

Livyánu have tattoos because they are covered in this ‘tar’, cast their spells which causes Chakra scars where the spells powers breach the skin. Then the scars are disguised by tattoos.

Secret book: Hlucha Ardari Rayana Tlakotani is a possible candidate for the throne should Resplendant Flame be killed. It is imperative that the Emperor be encouraged to bear many children. Although the Lady herself professes no desire, and hid during the Civil War, her supporters in secret societies are a presence toward drafting her, willing or not.  
(Reply: The presence of the sword is needed in the East. Continue to observe the General and report)

Long ago when I was but a Molkar of the 12th Imperial Light Infantry, my General, Dijaya hiQurruluma decided that as the war was over, I would be assigned to an imperial mission. Know this, when there is a surfeit of officers, molkars are retired or sent to recruit. I was happy that she answered my request to learn about the officers who work with battle magicians by sending me on the mission.

The mission was to a far away place near the fungus eaters of m’morcha. The troops were garrison regulars and militia under my command and the clan which was sent to establish trade was Red Flower. I was told that by observing and recording the shamanistic practices I would come to understanding the basics of battle magic.

The results were catastrophic. We got past ant pirates and enemies by virtue of the ship we were in, an old decommissioned airiness that the clan hadvrefurbished. Once anchored in a small bay near m’morcha it was quickly realized that the ship would need major care to return. The captain was a Shen of the Red Flower clan, and by virtue of his crew, more Shen, he quickly usurped any of the clan or military rights of command.

I ignored this,building a fort on land near a native settlement (they called it a city) that traded by sea. The Shen immediately took over the settlement, killing its ruler and becoming settlement leader. Learning that the settlement existed in a dead magic zone and that enemies inland were continually attacking, the Shen reminded me that I should protect the place while he took the clan adventurers to rob tombs nearby.

I am no servant and put the Kasi in charge of the troops as they finished our earthworks. The Shen grudgingly accepted me on the expedition, and were it not for the Sword of Janule I fear that I would have never returned. The success of the expedition was beyond our wildest dreams.

We obtained a fortune of gems and jewellery, a fully functional lightning bringer and many trinkets of worth. The city sickness overwhelmed some of our party however and we made no more forays into the tombs. Instead, the Shen sent me out to scout up a nearby river. I took half a cohort, some of the surviving adventurers and requested the lightning bringer. The Shen, now bejewelled in ancients gear and eyes felt confident enough to refuse. The fool knew not that such gear only angers the sword of Janule but I did not press the point, feeling far less threatened than before.

The attack hit the city when we were away. Flying Sro destroyed the fort and a good part of my troops but were driven off or killed by the lightning bringer. Meanwhile we scouts learned of the enemy, who claimed to be the Germinators of Existence, an offshoot of the war against the Blasphemous Accelerators.

On return I was quietly furious. We billeted in the “city” to keep our troops from being easily targeted and control the natives if need be. The Shen had sent another expedition up the coast and they returned victorious from an encounter with an army of Germinators. They also reported an even larger army on the way to us.

The enemy were relentless and though magic was virtually unusable in the city they called up a demon to assault us. It was Marassu the ever nearing pursuer, and it demanded a zig zag scimitar that one of the adventurers owned. I confronted this thing, and when it hesitated a fraction, I got the sword from the adventurer and threw it down, then shattered it with the Sword of Janule, crying “la, here is the sword, take it!” It took the shattered blade and left.

By this time the battle had turned into guerrilla fighting in the jungles, the Shen lending its troops to the defense until the war bogged down. Shortly after truce talks began a Tsolyani ship arrived, with Red Flower clansmen to remove the loot and a government official to act as governor. The official was promptly assassinated and I barely escaped the same fate. The remaining adventurers and myself took it upon ourselves to find a way home that didn’t involve these pirates. A nexus, tubeway car, friendly passing ship…months passed.

The reader knows the rest. How we appeared five years earlier in the timeline, quietly lived our lives ipuntil we could no longer meet ourselves, then reported. The Red Flower Clan then had some worthies impaled for tax evasion, treason and piracy while I? As a general I now use that lovely lightning bringer as my personal conveyance. The gods smile upon the honourable
