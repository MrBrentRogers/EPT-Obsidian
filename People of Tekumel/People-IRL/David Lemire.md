Joe Pizzirusso As regards the sarcophagus that transports a party back to Bednalljan times, the device could create an elaborate simulacrum of time travel and Nayari's Court; if such were the case, no paradoxes would entrain. The PCs would either die near the coffin in the Mnekshetra Tomb or re-emerge thinking they had really gone back in time. Were they to be so foolish as to go again, they would return to the same instant as before (with the simulacra inhabiting the massive illusion having no record whatsoever of their first visit).

If the PCs make a difficult saving throw vs paralysis they see a ruined sarcophagus with score upon score of human skeletal remains scattered about nearby. People who died believing in the illusion.

One of them is the Tomb of Mnekshetra, Lesbian Mistress of Nayari, Empress of All (notice that I will not call her "of the Silken Thighs). Anyway, if you open her sarcophagus incorrectly you are transported back in time to Nayari's court. And Nayari is mad.
