# Tékumel Timeline

[https://tekumel.fandom.com/wiki/T%C3%A9kumel_Timeline](https://tekumel.fandom.com/wiki/T%C3%A9kumel_Timeline) and Humanspace Empires and Sourcebooks

The world of Tékumel, Nu Ophiuchi d (a.k.a. Sinistra d), was first settled by humans exploring the galaxy about 60,000 years in the future, along with several other alien species. Their extensive terraforming of the inhospitable environment, including changing the planet's orbit and rotation rate to create a 365.25-day year, disrupted local ecologies and banished most of the local flora and fauna (including some intelligent species) to small reservations in the corners of their own world, resulting in a golden age of technology and prosperity for Mankind and its allies. Tékumel became a resort world, where the wealthy from a thousand other stars could while away their time next to its warm seas.

Suddenly, and for reasons unknown, Tékumel and its star system (Tékumel's two moons, Gayél and Káshi, its sun, Tuléng, and four other planets, Ülétl, Riruchél, Shíchel, and Zirúna) were cast out of our reality into a "pocket dimension" (known as a béthorm in Tsolyáni), in which there were no other star systems. Gravitic stresses nearly tore the planet apart and destroyed many cities and installations. Interstellar trade was immediately and permanently severed, and a Time of Darkness descended over the planet.

One hypothesis is that this isolation happened through hostile action on the part of an unknown party or group. Another is that the cosmic cataclysm was due to over-use of a faster than light drive which warped the fabric of space. No one knows, but the inhabitants of Tékumel, both human, native, and representatives of the other starfaring races, were now isolated and alone.

Severed from vital interplanetary trade routes (Tékumel is a world very poor in heavy metals) and in the midst of a massive gravitic upheaval due to the lines of gravitational force between the stars being suddenly cut, civilization was thrown into chaos. The intelligent native species, the Hlǘss and the Ssú, broke free from their reservations and wars as destructive as the massive geographic changes ravaged the planet. Civilization fell rather messily, and the Time of Darkness descended.

Sometime after the disaster, human scientists/philosophers (perhaps aided by the some of the more psychically gifted nonhumans) discovered that in the new dimension, the power of the human mind alone, unaided by technology, could draw power through from extra-dimensional space, and ‘magic’ developed. The sorcerers of the ancient Empire of Llyán of Tsámra mapped nexi between various dimensions and made pacts with various dwellers of other planes, called ‘demons’ by the uninitiated, inhabitants of dimensions near in n-dimensional space to Tékumel's pocket dimension, by those knowledgeable, were made.

Contact was also made with a race of extremely powerful beings that were for all human purposes ‘gods’. These powerful extra-dimensional or multi-dimensional alien beings subtly encouraged human worship and dependence; great unchanging religious bureaucracies developed, and after several millennia of religious warfare, the temples agreed upon a Concordat which disallowed open religious conflict, which further exaggerated the Tékumelani tendency toward stagnation.

The people of Tékumel lack the anthropocentric belief that the universe is knowable and conquerable; they know that there are races and beings which dwarf them in power, and that there are magics and sciences which are far beyond their grasp; intellectual and scientific curiosity is rare and even subtly discouraged. Science began to stagnate until ultimately knowledge became grounded in traditions handed down from generations long ago, the belief that the universe was ultimately understandable slowly faded.

Great empires rose and fell over the next 30,000 years; the presence of ‘magic’ (really psychic phenomena), along with the obvious superiority (and near-complete inscrutability) of the sciences of the Ancients (whose technology was largely irreparable due to a lack of necessary raw materials) led to a stagnation of the sciences, and to societies which depended largely upon tradition, precedent, and the bonds of family and clan for stability.

As a result of these historical processes, there exist upon the face of the great primary continent of the northeastern hemisphere of Tékumel the Five Empires, all of which are monarchical/theocratic oligarchies in which precedent and tradition hold the strength of law, and many smaller states which balance themselves between two or more of their larger neighbors. There are small enclaves of nonhuman races, most of whom owe allegiance to a human empire, and several states ruled by the inimical races, who still hate humanity and its allies with a passion, but are outnumbered by the more invaders. The Five Empires (one of which is the titular Empire of the Petal Throne, Tsolyánu) have technology about on the level of the European Renaissance (aqueducts, good roads, simple mechanics, wheeled carts, siege engines, crude surgery and slightly more advanced pharmacology, crossbows, water clocks, etc.). Their governments are greatly hidebound and bureaucratic, like those of ancient China. They have mighty, well-organized legions like those of the Romans. Their gods are like those of the Hindus, with a heavy dose of the bloodthirsty Aztec or Mayan deities. Their legal codes and sciences are much like those of the Arab philosophers of the Middle Ages; they are obsessed with personal and family honor, much like the medieval Japanese. The societies presented with the game are very intricate and very old (the youngest governments are some 2,500 years developed, and they have histories, traditions, and myths stretching back some 25,000 years).

Since the societies are so intricate and formal, political maneuvering and subtlety, combined with the right amount of heroic action and appropriate posturing, are the keys to power, thus deal mostly with intrigue and plotting between the various power groups, combined with expeditions after some bit of lost knowledge or some sorcerous object from an ancient tomb. There are bits and pieces of ancient technology, which still function (many are self-repairing within limits, others have been maintained carefully by human and nonhuman sages or by robot servitors); these are fought over as powerful tools.There are mighty legions of thousands of soldiers wearing brightly-lacquered armor, wearing great Kheshchál-plumes, and beating huge Karéng war drums, sorcerers calling on terrible demons with secret names, giant pyramidal temples thousands of years old upon which hundreds of war-captives are sacrificed to Vimúhla, the Lord of Flame, etc.

Tékumelani culture is very baroque, with titles like Reader of the Peerless Scrolls of Martial Glory, huge statues of the 97th Aspect of Lady Avánthe, Tánule the Patron of Lovers, and twenty-three forms of the pronoun ‘you’, to be used when speaking to individuals of varying status and profession!

Tékumel Timeline

A Chronological Presentation of Tékumel, The Sidereal Universe, and The Majesty of The Empire of The Petal Throne

Originally by Shawn Bond

Added to by Brent Rogers

Author's Note: The reader will note that this chronology utilizes two dating periods, anno Domini (AD) and after Seal (AS). The calendar begins with the Christian calendar system of "anno Domini" for ease of the reader to gain a perspective of how the sequence of events that lead to Tékumel pertains to his or her own time (circa 1900's). The second calendar utilizes the Tsolyáni calendar of "after Seal" which began upon the ascension of the first mythical Seal Emperor (it was felt that placing the historical perspective of Tékumel in terms of Tsolyáni history would again provide a familiar frame of reference for the reader). It should also be noted that almost all of this material has been gleaned from the myriad sources of text written by Prof. MAR Barker (and a few others) over the years, and in no way should anyone construe that this humble author is taking any creative credit (though an occasional comment or suggested insight may have sneaked in here and there).

Another historical timeline is combined using the date format of Before Second Imperium (B.S.)

Current history "ends" with the civil war still raging (or perhaps simmering is a better word) in Tsolyánu, the Red Hats still holding Pan Chaka and Livyanu, and Salarvyani forces both raiding the Empire's eastern provinces and bickering amongst themselves. Additional details will be incorporated as more information comes in. My contacts in Tsolyánu (namely Tilekka hiVaishya of Jakalla and a few other adventurous "scholars") are rather busy at the moment, and I do not wish to take too much of their time.

## Tekumel Planetary History

**Tékumel is discovered by explorers from Humanspace**. Its sun, Sinistra in Nu Ophiuchi, is found amongst the trade routes of several stellar empires, including the Shen and pocket Empires in the Beyond. Economic advantages for having a mercantile base at this location outway the cost of pacifying the hostile natives and terraforming the inhospitable planet.

62,011 AD - Time of Humanspace Empires (HSE)

62,000-62,110 AD

The armies and fleets of the Humanspace Empire combat the indigenous Ssú and H’lüss civilizations in the Sinistra system. Following the victory of Humanspace forces, Tekumel is terraformed. War and terraforming result in the extermination of 98% of the planet’s native life . Surviving Ssu, Hluss, and related sentient species relocated onto closely guarded reservations

60,000-60,110 AD - ??

Domination of Tékumel during the Dynasty of the Veritable Autocrator. The Autocrator's armies and fleets raze the indigenous Ssú and Hlüss civilizations. Terraforming of the planet and extermination of 98% of the native life. Ssú, Hlüss, and related sentient species relocated onto closely guarded preserves.

60,111-61,912 AD - ??

Tékumel is made into a pleasure planet and trading center for Humanspace and the other spacefaring alien empires. Human and alien masters stock private animal preserves and zoos. Mighty starships bring the wealth of many worlds to the jaded merchant-princes of Tékumel. "Men sing of Tékumel as home." Such peace and prosperity is said to last almost 50,000 years.

62,111-ca. 111, 912 AD

Tekumel is the jewel of Humanspace, a pleasure planet and trading center

ca. 111, 912 AD Tékumel thrown into pocket dimension, the Time of Darkness. The same fate befalls 722 other worlds in Humanspace

### 111,912 AD - The Cataclysm “The Time of Darkness”

The Cataclysm hurls Tékumel into a starless pocket dimension by supposed hostile forces (the Pariah Deities perhaps?). The once great civilization of Tékumel, the Joyous Light of the Golden Age, goes dim and is extinguished. The great culture is broken in only a few hundred years. Thus do sages refer to this sad era as "The Time of Darkness."

61,000+ AD / 30,000 B.S. / -37,000AS - The Latter Times begins.

B.S. = Before Second Imperium

AS = After Second Imperium

The Latter Times begins. Those that survived cataclysm hoard everything, even toiletries. Some new devices manufactured for a while. Mental techniques for drawing power from other dimensions (i.e. magic) developed.

The power from beyond “the skin of reality” is used in the creation of many techno-magical devices.

The Ru’ún and Yéleth are created by the “Lords of the Latter Times”

Experimentation with "interplanar energies” leads to technological inventions that harness interplanar energy.

The early experiments are dangerous. There are strange and disturbing accidents with devices and people. Some of the very first contact with beings of other Planes is made. Later, these will come to be called ‘demons’. Some of the researchers themselves become trapped in terrifying states in which they essentially become ‘demons’ themselves. Some of the devices from the Latter Times are so bizarre that it is wondered if perhaps the researchers were driven mad by their discoveries.

The Ssú and Hlüss presumably discover their own psychic talents.

Wars with the Hlutrgú also begin in the Latter Times. While the Hlutrgú do not learn “magic”, something sets off rapid reproduction, and they overrun many human settlements

111,912-111,812 AD -

The same fate as Tékumel befalls 722 other worlds of Humanspace (it is unknown whether worlds in the empires of other alien species suffer a similar fate). It is unrecorded whether Earth falls to the ravages of the unknown enemy.

### 111,912-106,912 AD - "The Latter Times."

The space-age civilization of Tékumel has collapsed into barbarism from geologic upheavals and disruptions of essential supplies brought by starships. The machines begin to die. The Ssu and Hluss exult in the misfortune of their enemies and take back whatever they can. Local hoarders and warlords seize everything within their power. The Hlutrgu burst upon the coastal swamplands and are only forced back after a long series of brutal and bloody wars. The Hokun pretend to befriend mankind, war with them, enslave humanity and rule them as gods, and are eventually defeated by their slaves, forcing the Hokun to retreat to a great island in the southern seas. The Mihalli civilization in the east is destroyed by a great planetary bomb used by a neighboring human kingdom (who are also destroyed by the weapon). Such is "The Latter Times."

25,000 B.S. / -31,524 AS -- Empire of Llyán of Tsamra, first known historical empire, arises and conquers what is now Livyánu and Mu'ugalavyá.

(106,912 AD approximate) -31,525 AS – (AS = After Seal)

The ancient Llyan Empire (proto-Livyanu) founded by Llyan at the city of Tsamra. The sorcerers of Llyan discover the existence of nexus points, compound the texts of demonology and map the topography of the Planes Beyond. "Magic" (psychic powers of the mind) is refined from what was learned by the Great Ancients and the Lords of the Latter Times, and compilation of spells are made by the scientist-magicians of Llyan. Genetic templates for many guardian creatures and servants of mankind are fashioned using the still-functioning **genetic-plasma machines** of the bygone Age of Wonder. Fragmentary records indicate that worship of the Pariah Gods is widespread (The One Other, The One Who Is, and the Goddess of the Pale Bone - Ku'u Tep in the tongue of Llyan).

### mid -26,000 AS / 24,000 B.S - The Three States of the Triangle

The Three States of the Triangle (Urmish, Jakalla, and Thraya) arise in power, founded in area of modern Tsolyánu.

The city-state of Mihállu (inhabited by humans) was destroyed by one of their weapons.

The Triangle States come to be at war with the Chürstálli

They make alliance with Shén to fight the Hlüss.

The States of the Triangle get invaded and conquered by the Dragon Warriors

-23,525 AS / 23,000 B.S. - Contact with **Vimúhla**

Contact with Vimúhla by Llyan scholars followed by rapid spread of worship of the Lord of Fire throughout the Llyan Empire. Lesser influence of Vimúhla in the Three States of the Triangle. The Llyan Empire begins to deteriorate from political stagnation and religious zeal for the Flame Lord.

Nluss warbands (soon to be known as the Dragon Warriors) begin to migrate from their mountainous homelands, driven to plunder and conquest by the red-robed priests of Vimúhla. The Dragon Warriors, Vimúhla-worshipping barbarian tribesman from Nlüssa invade from the north and wipe out Llyáni empire and the Triangle. Whether the 'Dragons' of their name are actual beasts (probably Sró - see Bestiary) or ancient flying machines is subject of historical speculation.

beginning of -23,495 AS - The Dragon Warriors Conquer

The Dragon Warriors from the lands of ancient N’lüssa conquer the city-states of what will be Mu'ugalavya, riding mighty, flying "dragons" (aircars of the ancients?) and pillaging the land.

-23,445 AS - The Dragon Warriors destroy the remnants of Llyan's Empire

The Dragon Warriors destroy the remnants of Llyan's Empire. They proto-N’lüss futilely war upon the Shén states to the South (who have allied with the Triangle States), with little success other than spilling much blood of both human and alien. Dragon Warrior hordes migrate East and Northeast.

-23,345 AS - The Dragon Warriors conquer

The Dragon Warriors conquer the coasts of what is now Yán Kór and wage wars with the Three States of the Triangle.

-23,265 AS - The Three States of the Triangle fall

The Three States of the Triangle fall and are pillaged by the Dragon Warriors.

-23,245 AS - The Dragon Warriors March

The Dragon Warriors march all the way through what is now Salarvyá. They occasionally battle the Ahoggyá (though the Dragon Warrior are loathe to enter the fetid swamplands of the aliens) and seafaring Nóm raiders.

-23,240 AS - Gámulu of Fenul leads rebellion

Gámulu of Fenul leads rebellion against the weak N’lüss overlords in ancient Salarvyá.

-23,235 AS - Gámulu drives the Dragon Warriors out

Gámulu drives the Dragon Warriors out of western Salarvya. The empire of the Dragon Warriors fragments into thousands of clans, small states, and cities. Hordes of Ssu pour out from their refuges to make war upon humanity; their armies ravage Pechano - first capturing their long lost capital of Ssuganar and then pulling down Benesh (which never rises again) near the present city of Mechaneno. The Ssu Wars begin.

-23,235 to 23,210 AS - Ssú expeditions strike Northward

Ssú expeditions strike northward into Chaigari and Kilalammu, threatening even the high aeries of the Hlaka. These beings make alliance with Gámulu and his people. Both sides rage back and forth for many years. This war is characterized by many campaigns with sporadic interludes. Eight of Gamulu's 14 sons fall in battle with the Foe of Man.

-23,210 AS - Gámulu drives the Ssú out

Gámulu drives the Foe of Man back below Ssuyal, leaving fields choked with tattered gray bodies and slain human warriors. Gámulu holds a great victory celebration in the whispering ruins of old Ssuganar.

### 21,000 B.S. / -23,200 AS -- Empire of the Fisher Kings founded

Empire of the Fisher Kings founded in modern Salarvyá (Language: dialects of Bednálljan (Ancient Salarvyáni)), destroyed warring remnants of Dragon Lords empire. Ksárul, God of Sorcery and Secrets, is contacted.

-23,200 AS - Gámulu dies

Gámulu drives the Ssú back beneath their capital city of Ssuganár. Gámulu dies from a mysterious wasting disease contracted in Ssuganár (some say it is a curse laid upon him by the vengeful Ssú during his time in Ssuganár, others believe its radiation poisoning). The 12th son of Gámulu, Ho Etehltu, kills his remaining sibling rivals and is crowned as emperor, founding a dynasty later to be known as the Fisherman Kings, who commanded fleets of black ships that ranged up and down the coasts of Salarvyá and proto-Tsolyánu. Ho Etehltu raids and conquers the region as far east as Peleis. He seizes the Dragon Warriors' strongholds on the islands of Gánga, Thayuri, and Vra, and his black ships besiege the city of Jakálla (though unable to take it). The Fisherman fleet crosses the straits to capture Haida Pakala from an unknown nonhuman race that then held it (Hokun?)

-23,200 to -23,000 AS - Contact with **Ksárul**

Contact with the interdimensional being now called Ksárul during the 22nd king of Gámulu's dynasty. Religious persecution and strife against the emerging priesthood of Ksárul by Vimúhla priests. The religious strife provides impetus to ring about the beginnings of the Bednálljan Dynasty.

## 18,000 B.S. / -23,000 AS - Start of the Bednálljan Dynasty, First Empress of the First Imperium

Contact with Hrü'ǘ, Sárku, Dlamélish.

Language: Bednálljan (Ancient Salarvyáni)

A teenage desert clan-girl advances by intrigue, sex, assassination, and military savvy, to be the first empress of the First Imperium (or the Bednálljan Dynasties), Nayári of the Silken Thighs. It covers what is now Tsolyánu and Yán Kór. Her reign is bloody and ruthless. Her dynasty lasted 3,000 years. **Hrü'ǘ**, God of Darkness, **Sárku**, God of the Undead and Worms, and **Dlamélish**, Goddess of Perversion and Orgies, are contacted.

Nayari of the Silken Thighs assassinates the governor of Purdanim and quickly consolidates political power using sex and violence.

the Bednálljan Period that the later Tsolyáni love of formality, elaborate tradition and military pageantry has its roots.

Nayári ran a model army that set the pattern of organization still used today. Many of the cities of what will be the Empire of Tsolyánu are first united under her (and her descendants): Purdánim, Jakálla, Sokátis, Tumíssa, Béy Sü, Fasíltum, portions of Yán Kór, Salarvyá, and Mu’ugalavyá were also taken.

Shén, Pé Chói, Páchi Léi, Pygmy Folk, Tinalíya, and even Ahoggyá come to join the Bednálljan legions. Eventually, they come to live alongside humanity as they once did in the Latter Times.

The Sákbe Roads are begun by Nayári’s grandson Ssirandár I.

The Shunned Ones, Hlutrgú, Hlüss, and Ssú are driven into hiding.

Descendants of the First Imperium become the Salarvyáni. Queen Nayári is perhaps the archetype for Salarvyá’s main deity, the goddess Shiringgáyi, who seems to combines Avánthe’s maternal authority with Dlamélish’s eroticism.

The First Imperium generally worshipped Vimuhla-like deities that were those of the Dragon Warriors. The older, non-Vimuhla substrata of society apparently went on worshipping whatever they worshipped. This is not really known today, since it was so long ago, and the archaeological record is far from complete! Bednálljan nobles did bury their dead, usually in deep, rock-cut tombs. The dead were wrapped, inserted into stone sarcophagi, and sealed with resin, lead, or some other materials. They were not often embalmed. The followers of Lord Sarku seem to have followed similar customs, embalming their dead occasionally, putting grave-goods in with them (or in storerooms nearby) "to accompany the deceased on his or her journey through the Afterlife," and added underground labyrinths and catacombs to protect the corpses of the mighty.

-22,900 AS -

Jigresh, Tiritlen of Lord Sárku, commands the demon lords Tkel and Srukarum to fashion the Maze Temple of Jigresh as a place of steadfastness for the priesthoods of Sárku and Durritlámish.

-22,882 AS -

Capital of the First Imperium is moved by Nayari's grandson to the newly built city, Béy Sü ("Soul of the World"). The construction of the Sakbe Roads is begun, linking the cities of the First Imperium.

-20,853 AS - The priest Pavár is born.

-20,800 AS -

The crippled Pavár, priest of Enome (Ksárul) contacts the **Grey Lord Tham (Thúmis**), and with the remaining Lords of Stability soon thereafter.

15,000 B.S. / -20,800 AS - **Pavár contacts the Gods of Stability**

The priest Pavár on the island of Engsvan hla Gánga contacts the Gods of Stability: Hnálla, God of Light, Karakán, God of War, Thúmis, God of Wisdom, Belkhánu, God of Protection, and Avánthe, Goddess of Family and Agriculture. His successors found a theocracy that encompasses all of the known world, the Engsvanyáli Empire. This is a golden age of art, scholarship and civilization that lasts 10,000 years.

-20,763 AS - Pavár dies

Pavár dies in his sleep at the age of ninety. His disciples carry the new pantheon to the far corners of the First Imperium.

-20,700 AS -

Civil war spreads across the land between the new and old religions (the fruits of this civil war would establish the now regional strongholds of the Pantheon of Pavár in Tsolyánu). The Scrolls of Pavár are copied and spread across the continent by delegates of the temple of Nallal (Hnálla). The Emperor of the First Imperium and his glittering court watch with apprehension to growing civil unrest. Work begins to expand the ancient citadel of Evu Nithoru (Avanthar), a stronghold since before the Time of Darkness, into the fortress it is today.

### -20,600 AS - The Concordat is Established

The Concordat is established between the temples of Change and Stability under Ghiyal Tranuo, High Priest of Nallal on Gánga and appointed successor to Pavár. Power shifts from Béy Sü to Pavár's home island of Gánga when the Emperor, Meshkanuma Amessu III invites the High Priests of the Tlomitlanyal to Béy Sü to advise him. The ancient capital of the First Imperium, time lost Purdanim, has begun to fall into ruin. The Emperor is made to swear never to worship the Pariah Gods. The cities of what is now Tsolyánu have now gone over to the pantheon of Pavár. The now lost art of perfume writing is perfected during the reign of Meshkanuma Amessu III. Scholars generally agree that this is the time when Engsvan hla Gánga (wrongly called the Kingdom of the Gods by many scholars) arises as a true political power.

-20,453 AS -

Emperor Balakanuma I assumes the throne after the death (some say by poison or magic) of Emperor Changgala. The emperor, a devotee of Kerek (Karakán) doubles the size of the realm, seizes Milumanaya, marches along the shores of the Northern Sea, and captures Hleker (Ke'er) from descendants of the Dragon Warriors and the Lorun tribes.

-20, 163 AS -

Priestly advisors become the real masters of the realm at the Imperial Court of the First Imperium. The High Priest of Nallal wields as much, if not more, power as the Emperor. The affairs of government and the police were the province of Chokhar's clergy. The High Adept of Kerek had charge of the army, and trade and economic affairs were managed jointly by the temples of Evuen and Tham. The temple Vaomahl establishes its power in Fa'asal and amongst the clans in the south-western city of Thamis.

-19,963 AS -

Tirisan Jakona, Patriarch of Ba'alk, revitalizes the administration of Engsvan hla Gánga.

-19,915 AS -

The last Emperor of the Bednálljan Empire, Tarishande XIII, is spirited away from Béy Sü by his remaining loyal servants. This band of political refugees flee from the pursuing contingent of Gánga soldiers across the Northern Sea to beyond the North Pole. The Empire of Gánga officially begins. The Priestkings continue to add to the network of Sakbe-roads and fortify these walls with many watch-towers and keeps, and practice the Bednalljan custom of Pashatl. The temples establish the practice of using networks of telepaths to deliver messages. Also during this era, the great scholar Waba of Ka Kokoth writes his greatest work, "The Periplus of Farther Voyaging."

-19,763 AS -

The legions of the Priestkings lay siege to Shoshche (Ch'ochi) in Mu'aghatl. Though the siege lasts over 20 years, the Empire of Gánga cannot invest the ancient pre-Cataclysm military base.

-19,885 AS -

Legend tells of a tall, sun-blackened old man who appeared in Ja'akath, speaking the "high" speech and acting in the manners of the old court of the Bednálljan Emperors. What occurs to this stranger is lost to history.

-19,413 AS -

Marya, the greatest Engsvanyali sculptor, creates his masterpiece, "Woman of Tsamra." The artist employed one Nia Alel, a Livyani serving maid, as the model for his renowned work.

-19,097 AS -

The practice of electing a Priestking via the priestly council of Gánga is abandoned in favor of hereditary succession. The posts of High Priest and Adept are also passed on to offspring in many of the temples.

-18,925 AS -

Priestking Arkhuam Mssa dies of a horrible plague that is later named after him.

-18, 692 to -18,667 AS -

Revolution, civil war, and the destruction of temples during the reign of Priestking Bashdis Mssa VII. This Priestking falls to Arkhuan Milende, "He Who Hates the Gods." The Legion of the Seekers of Indelible Victory is sent east, through Mihallu, into the barren Plains of Glass, where it disappears.

-18,667 to -18,664 AS -

Most of the emperor's family are executed after Béy Sü falls (their heads hacked off by the rebel himself or thrown from the palace towers).

-18,394 AS -

Bashdis Mssa X, the twelve year-old child of Bashdis Mssa IX, disappears from Béy Sü after its fall to Tettukanu Dlee I. Scholars think that the child was abducted by priests of the One Other (perhaps to use him against Tettukanu Dlee I).

### [Civil war and the end of the First Epoch]

## -18,394 to -15,894 AS - Start of the Second Epoch, Engsvanyali Era

This time period is referred to as the Second Epoch. This era is marked by many semi-autonomous states that are called "Engsvanyali," by historians. Following the disappearance of Bashdis Mssa X, the clergy of several temples warred against the temples of the Pariah Gods, and then rose up against Gánga itself (it is lost to history as to which temples turned against the Empire - this historian feels that most of the antagonists were those of the temples of Change). This religious war added to the ongoing secular civil war. The Vriddi declared Fasiltum independent; Teshengtu Tlekolmu "the Hammer of the West" did likewise in Tumissa; the northern regions of what is now Yán Kór slipped away; Salarvya, Mihallu, and the east also left the Empire. On another note, the Tsolei Archipelago and the southern regions of cold, northern Nluss was conquered by one of the fragmented Engsvanyali Empire. Despite the political chaos of the Second Epoch, much was accomplished in the arts, military knowledge, and the sciences. The emergence of local dialects of the Engsvanyali language is noted. The "Hero of the Age" drives out the servants of the Pariah Deities into the Outer Darkness. The Priestking Hemanche Farkhenu solidifies the much shrunken Engsvanyali Empire.

The Priestking rewards each soldier of the Legion of the Joyful Clan of the Noble Vrayani with slingstones of rubies and diamonds.

-14,871 AS - the Rebellion of the Right Hand

The ancient priestly Council is summoned into session after the last Girandu passes without issue or relative for the throne. The Rebellion of the Right Hand ensues between the candidates for the throne of the Empire. Chayetlesa Tlalesu, a priestess of Ksárul, remains as the lone survivor of the rebellion. She is declared the Priest-queen, and "The Long Peace" is ushered in.

MARB: In Engsvanyali times. A province in modern day Mu’ugalavyá felt they were being overtaxed and sent a delegation to Gánga. The Priestking accepted their petition but signed the subsequent decree with his left hand. This is often taken to mean someone is lying, as the left hand is "unclean". It is not certain whether the Priestking meant it or was simply left-handed, but the upshot was that the province rose in rebellion. Their enemies joined the Priestking’s forces in quashing the rebellion.

-14,866 to -14,844 AS -

## 0 A.S. The Tlakotáni (After Second Imperium)

Second Imperium of Tsolyánu founded out of the chaos by a man known only as "The Tlakotáni", the name of the current Imperial clan.

1 AS - Start of the Tlakotáni Dynasty

Language: Classic Tsolyáni.

Human history has undergone the Time of No Kings. Countless city-states have risen and fallen. Kings have been crowned and killed in the space of a year.

Earliest mention of the “First Legion” of Tsolyánu during the siege of Uruse (Urmish?) which results in the accession of the First Emperor. Revelation of the Seal of the Empire of the Petal Throne. The (now mythical) First Emperor of the Petal Throne gains the support of the other nobles andis crowned, and unites Tsolyáni, signaling the beginning of the Tlakotáni Dynasty. The emperor of Tsolyánu is known as the “Seal Emperor”, a reference to the artifact that can place an unforgeable mark upon parchment, stone, and metal. Orders directly from the Emperor can thus not be forged.

Northern settlements band together in shifting alliances. Herder raiders from the Desert of Sighs force proto-Yán Kóryani settlements to arm women, causing the rise of feudal warrior-women in the lands of Yán Kór. A dozen chiefdoms grow in the North, ruled by warrior matriarchs.

The Petal Throne is a device of the ancients whose powers are unknown.

The Jade Arch is said to ensure the lifelong loyalty of one who walks under it, a device probably from the time of the Priestkings.

Kolumejálim: (unknown when this practice started). Once crowned, the Emperor does not leave the palace at

Avanthár. Imperial heirs are fostered, openly or secretly, to various factions. Upon the death of the current ruler, the heirs compete for the throne in the ritual of the Kolumejálim.

In order to gain information and keep up with current events, therefore, he set aside part of the Legion to serve in every city in the Empire as agents of the Imperium, spies, and watch-dogs over the political and sectarian disputes which plagued Tsolyanu. During his reign, thus, the Legion was first officially split into three types of members: military, intelligence, and the personal servants of the Emperor himself, the deaf-mute Servitors of Silence corps to the Petal Throne. Apparently, the Legion of Emperor Horkhunen’s day never numbered more than the standard Tsolyani twenty Cohorts, but some of these were permanently detached for special service while others guarded Avanthar or took part in the military actions of the Empire.

Creation of the Four Palaces, reformation of provincial administration and taxation reforms.

Market taxes, property taxes, various types of imposts upon mines and fisheries - all came under Imperial scrutiny. The Omnipotent Azure Legion was assigned specific administrative duties as well: e.g. its offices became a “court of last resort” for cases involving the interests of the Imperium. Its intelligence facilities were broadened, and its role in the surveillance of Imperial government increased many-fold. At this time there was talk of divorcing these administrative and intelligence functions from the military arm of the Legion, and also from the Servitors of Silence in Avanthar; this never seems to have been put into effect, however, since the Tsolyani love of tradition and the inertia of long established custom are so prominent in the society of the Seal Imperium.

1993 AS -

Tanmrúktu the Astronomer (Undying Wizard) arrives in Jakálla, Tsolyáni from the Secret City of Dlásh in Livyánu.

Tanmrúktu is of somewhat indeterminate age: appearing to be in his late 50s/early 60s. He dresses in a fairly austere way, without showing any particular religious affiliations. He lives in a tower on one of the hills of Pála Jakálla. He lives alone, though he sometimes engages servants for short periods, though none of them last long. He is well-known in Pála Jakálla society, and will occasionally be found at social events.

Tanmrúktu is not a Tsolyáni native, although he has been in Tsolyánu so long that nobody alive can remember exactly where he came from originally.

In truth he is originally from the Secret City of Dlásh in Livyánu. He was declared a heretic by his fellow priests, and he managed to escape north to Mu’ugalavyá. He was not welcome there either, so he moved on to Tsolyánu, which was at the time under the rule of the vapid and uninterested Neshkirúma the Cloud-Spinner. He failed to notice the arrival of the heretic in 1960.

In Livyánu Tanmrúktu had reached the 16th Circle in the hierarchy of the Temple of the One of Fears. His heresy involved the closer linking of the Demon-Lords to the Shadow Gods, inferring that the Shadow Gods are merely more powerful versions of creatures such as Lord Órigob. To the average Tsolyáni priest, of course, this is merely common sense.

In his 400 years in the Empire, Tanmrúktu has devoted himself to the study of all the demons. He is possibly the foremost expert on the truth about all the demons. He has about 27 levels in both Demon Lore, and Practical Demonology. As well as his preeminence in the field of demonology he is quite well versed in various other sciences: Mathematics; Medicine; Astronomy; Astrology; Geography.

Languages (modern)

Tsolyáni (Native); Livyáni (Native (but slightly archaic); Mu’ugalavyáni (Intermediate); Salarvyáni (Advanced), Tsoleíni (Intermediate); Pe’é (Intermediate)

Languages (ancient)

Duruób (Near Native); Llyáni (Advanced); Ensvanyáli (Advanced); Sunúz (Intermediate); Thu’úsa (Advanced); Bednálljan (Advanced).

At the moment the popular belief is that Tanmrúktu is a renegade priest from the Nyémesel Isles. This belief will probably persist for a few months until somebody comes up with a new theory.

Priest Harsan activates the Man of Gold and closes Tékumel from The Goddess of the Pale Bone.

_The Eastern Campaign Begins_

_Recognising that the Western Front against Yan Kor has stagnated, Mirusiya proposes opening an eastern campaign to disrupt the Baron's allies, Milumanaya and Saa Allaqi, and force him to surrender. Tsolyanu has the resources to fight a war on two fronts; Yan Kor does not. These plans are hesitantly supported by the Military Party._

2361 AS -

(East) The Eastern Campaign, under Prince Mirusiya and Lord Kaikama, begins at Thri’il. Many powerful figures dedicated to the gods of Change and of Stability, dubbed “New Men,” join the Prince (Lord Kaikama, General Heketh of Purdimal, Lord Kadawere, etc.) The eastern army advances through the Pass of Skulls and takes the Fortress of Skulls. The Yán Kóryani general, the Lady Deq Dimani (one of Yán Kór’s best generals and a lover of the Baron), feels that the fortresses in southern Milumanaya can slow a Tsolyáni advance in time to gather more reinforcements. Prince Mirusiya attempts to conquer the desert state of Milumanaya. Tsolyáni advances catch the Yán Kóryani field army unprepared at the Battle of the Hill of the Stone Serudla (leaving the Tsolyáni in control of the field but badly bloodied). Ahriam Basram replaces Lord Kaikama as the supreme field commander. The Tsolyáni pursue Deq Dimani and her retreating Yán Kóryani forces. The Lady deals a check on the Tsolyáni advance at the Battle for the town of Mar, allowing the Yán Kór to regroup. The two armies settle down to reorganize around Mar. Deq Dimani leads a night attack on the Tsolyáni defenders in the Second Battle of Mar. The attempt fails and cumulates in the Third Battle of Mar and destruction of the eastern Yán Kór army when Tsolyáni flying columns led by Karin Missum take them in the rear.

Fall of the caravan city of Sunraya and the death of Firaz the Elder, all by a ruse of Ahrim Basram’s personal physician, the Livyani archmage Eloea. Capture of the Fortress Ninu'ur to the Legion of the Storm of Fire. Fall of Pu'er to the legions of the Seal of the Worm and the Scales of Brown, who break the Concordant by using undead soldiers. Prince Mirusiya commands the offending general impaled and demoralizes Sárku troops on the Eastern Front following testimony of several Flame soldiers.

(West) The Tsolyáni Western army (under by Prince Eselne) takes the Atkolel Heights. First General Kettukal takes the town of Akarsha in the bloodiest siege of the war. Lightning invasion of Pijena by seizing the town of Kai and blockade of Yán Kór garrison at Pijnar.

_First year of the Eastern Campaign._

_Tsolyani advance through the Pass of Skulls, win a Pyrrhic victory at the Hill of the Stone Serudla, and fight the three Battles of Mar, destroying the eastern Yan Koryani army at the third. Atrocities are committed by Sarku troops at the Siege of Pu'er. Sunraya captured by Tsolyani, who now firmly control eastern Milumanaya._

_Atrocities at Pu'er_

_Atrocities are committed by Dhich'une's Sarku troops during the Siege of Pu'er: in breach of the Concordat, they use undead soldiers in battle. The Sarku general uses undead in front of Prince Mirusiya's flame troops, in direct contravention of the Rules of War. When Mirusiya finds out, he has the commanding general -- a close friend of Prince Dhich'une -- impaled. This action demoralises the Sarku troops who were fighting in the army on the Eastern Front. (Note that Prince Dhich'une is not present at the incident)._

2362 AS -

(East) Tsolyáni troops control southern and eastern Milumaniya. Prince Mirusiya splits the eastern invasion force in Sa’a Allaqi. Death of Senior General Kadarsha hiTlekolmu of the Legion of the Searing Flame, commandant of the eastern armies under Prince Mirusiya at the Milumananyani village of Kankara while defending his Prince from a magical attack. Karim Missum is made Kerdudalikoi and given command of the Legion of Red Devastation. The Kerdudalikoi Ketkollel is made the governor of the new Tsolyáni province of Milumaniya with the Kerdu Kambe hiMorusai (new commander of the Legion of Searing Flame) serving as his military advisor. Battle of the town of Anohl with the defeat of the Tsolyáni army. General Karin Missum razes the city of Grai and Kru Sekka to bring Saa Allaqi to its knees (this causes the Ssao to break negotiations of peace with Avanthar and to recall his daughter, Princess Vrisa Vishetru, by sending her brother Mridan Vishetru to reclaim her). Kambe accepts command of the field forces when Karin Missum is recalled to Avanthar to deal with problems growing in the west. Kerdu Kutume of the Legion of the Storm of Fire pacifies the rear areas of Milumaniya.

(West) Prince Eselne is injured in a skirmish at Aqesha, forcing the Tsolyáni army to encamp in Kai. A Yán Kór treaty with Mu’ugalavya grants western Pijena to the Red Hats in exchange for military aide in surrounding Kai and sieging it.

_Devastation of Saa Allaqi; Advance_

_Second year of the Eastern Campaign. Southern Saa Allaqi devastated, effectively removing them from the Alliance. The Tsolyani advance against Tleku Miriya, brushing aside skirmishers to beseige the city._

2363 AS -

Kambe, “the Wall Walker,” leads Tsolyáni soldiers in a siege of Tleku Miriya. Deq Dimani is replaced as field commander by her brother, who is later killed without mercy by Kambe in hand-to-hand combat. The eastern Tsolyáni army occupies Tleku Miriya. Kerdu Kambe is made governor of Tleku Miriya.

_Capture of Tleku Miriya_

_Third year of the Eastern Campaign. The Yan Koryani attempt to forestall the fall of Tleku Miriya, bringing in Mu'ugalavyani help, but after a long siege and several assaults the city is taken by the Tsolyani. Kambe, the Tsolyani Commander in Chief, is made governor of Tleku Miriya; the army plans a campaign to finish the Baron._

### 2364 AS - Death of Emperor Hirkáne Tlakotáni

Emperor Hirkáne died and Prince Dhich'uné took the throne in a questionable manner, ending the war with Yán Kór. Civil war broke out between him and two other princes, Eselné and Mirusíya.

**Death of Emperor Hirkáne Tlakotáni** (now suspected of being murdered by his son, Prince Dhich'une, possibly with the aid of He'esa). Ascension of Emperor Dhich’une Tlakotáni “Eternal Splendor,” during the intercalary days after the Kolumejalim (which is held in one day). Prince Mridobu and Lord Muresh hiQolyelmu, Head of the Intelligence Arm of the Omnipotent Azure Legion, disappear from Avanthar. Units of troops loyal to Lord Sárku are regrouped near Thri’il, Aukesha, Sunraya, City of Sárku, and Avanthar. Vridekka hiTlelsu takes over the Intelligence Arm of the Omnipotent Azure Legion. Usenanu, Béy Sü, and other midland cities are ostensibly under the Emperor's control. Jakalla and Sokatis and the cities of the south-east only pay lip service to the new emperor. Alliance made with Yán Kór, as the Emperor appoints Baron Ald to the post of First General of the Empire. Rebellions in Tsolyánu are ruthlessly suppressed by the First General. General Ald garrisons Thri’il to seal Mirusiya’s army off in the north. Deq Dimani is sent to retake Sunraya and isolate the Tsolyáni armies. The Lady Deq Dimani manages to retake Sunraya but cannot take the citadel. Lord Fu Shi'i uses his Weapon Without Answer to trap Prince Mirusiya and the Eastern army in an other-planar shadow of Tleku Miriya. Kambe controls all forces north of Sunraya. He negotiates with the "king" of Milumanaya and the Mu'ugalavyani general Mi'itlanesh. Kutume commands the field forces in the south.

(East) Defeat of General Kanmbe at Dlakar while the general tries to relieve his Prince. Mirusiya and the remnants of the Eastern army are freed from Tleku Miriya by the actions of heros. Karin Missum reduces Tleku Miriya. Mirusiya marches south. Victory of Prince Mirusiya’s army against Sa’a Allaqiyani, Yán Kór, and Tsolyáni units at the second Battle of the town of Dlakar (where the Weapon Without Answer was temporarily disabled by magic). Defeat of the Eastern army at the Battle of the Town of Arver and the Prince’s flight south-west through the mountains to Fasiltum.

(West) Prince Eselne’s army breaks through the siege of Kai and regroups at Akarsha. The Western army force marches back to Chene Ho. Battle at the Fortress of Ti’Gurue with victory to the Prince.

2364 AS -

Prince Mirusiya proclaims his ascendancy to the Petal Throne and weds a newly revealed Lady Elara hiVriddi. The city of Fasiltum declares itself an independent state under the Prince until such time as the prince takes the Petal Throne as Emperor. Prince Eselne is slain by Lady Sitlaya hiHehesha at Paya Gupa, forcing soldiers loyal to the Prince to travel the underground tubeway car, defeating Sárku assassins, to retrieve Badragu Ejel hiKaraktu who can bring the Prince back to life.

2364 AS (early) -

Growing Mu’ugalavya incursions into the Chakan Provinces turn into an invasion of said provinces. Salarvyani raiders enter the Gilraya Forests. Tsolyánu and Yán Kór combine forces to oppose Mu’ugalavyu aggression in the west. A Mu’ugalavyani army besieges Paya Gupa; the Red Hats march before the walls of Tumissa, from up lines, and then break formation to retreat; brief battle surrounding Chene Ho.

_Accession of Emperor Dhich'une_

_Dhich'une kills his father, Emperor Hirkane Tlakotani, while on a visit to Avanthar, and ascends the throne in the intercalary days at the start of the year 2364. The Kolumejalim was held in one day, Dhich'une claiming victory when no one showed up (the fact that he didn't bother to notify anyone didn't seem to matter). Vridekka hiTlelsu takes over the Intelligence Arm of the Omnipotent Azure Legion, which is riddled with Dhich'une's agents._

_Alliance with Yan Kor_

_As Emperor, Dhich'une makes peace with Yan Kor, incorporating that empire within Tsolyanu. His ally, Baron Ald, becomes First General of the combined empires, and their forces fight side by side. (Yan Koryani forces have been secretly descending into Tsolyanu for some time, aided by Dhich'une's generals). Avanthar, Sarku City, Aukesha, Thri'il, Sunraya and most of the northern cities are firmly in their control. Fasiltum is a holdout: Mirusiya has guaranteed the Vriddi "autonomy within their own borders" in return for assisting him to the throne. Usenanu, Bey Su, and other midland cities are ostensibly under Dhich'une's control, although holdouts and underground movements still exist. Jakalla and Sokatis, and the cities of the south-east are far enough from everything that, although they pay lip service to the new "emperor", they are far from loyal to him. Any rebellion is ruthlessly suppressed._

_Mirusiya Betrayed_

_All the progress made in the war against Baron Ald is lost when Dhich'une usurps the Petal Throne. He makes the Baron First General of the Empire, then abandons the troops in the east to the Baron's mercy._

_The Baron destroys the city of Thri'il and seals Mirusiya's army off to the north. Lord Fu Shi'i's Weapon Without Answer is used to trap Mirusiya and Karim Missum in an other-planar shadow of Tleku Miriya. Deq Dimani is sent to retake Sunraya and split the Tsolyani armies apart. She manages to retake the city but cannot retake the citadel. Both sides have stalemated in Milumanaya, and Kambe (the Tsolyani C-in-C) negotiates in Pelesar to with the 'king' of Milumanaya and the Mu'ugalavyani general Mi'itlanesh._

_Mirusiya is rescued from entrapment. Karim Missum reduces Tleku Miriya._

_The army marches south, meeting opposition of Yan Koryani and Dhich'une's troops at Sunraya (where the Weapon Without Answer was temporarily disabled by magic), before being routed at Kayal Peak. Most of the army flees north. A small band of survivors escorts Mirusiya south-west through the mountains to Fasiltum, where he finds Elara hiVriddi, a leader of the Vriddi Rebellion of his youth whom he has always idolised and who (as a result of temporal suspension, from which she has recently been released) is now of an age to become his First Wife -- after Dhich'une is dethroned. Fasiltum declares itself independent of Tsolyanu until Mirusiya takes the throne._

_The Fall of the Chakas_

_In the summer of 2364, the Mu'ugalavyani invade the two Chakan Protectorates. The Pe Choi of Do Chaka are overrun, and Pan Chaka falls, the Pachi Lei being slaughtered or forced to flee. The Mu'ugalavyani besiege Paya Gupa, march to Tumissa, form up their lines, break formation and retreat. There is a brief fight at Chene Ho. When Eselne returns to western Tsolyanu, he forces the Mu'ugalavyani to break their siege and withdraw to Pan Chaka._

_Prince Eselne marches south towards Tumissa with the remains of his army, harried every step of the way by Mu'ugalavyani and Tsolyani-Yan Koryani forces._

_The Salarvyani Incursions_

_The Salarvyani take the outpost cities of Ru and Fenul and invade the Gilraya forests. They are too disorganised by internecine squabbling to take Thraya or Jaikalor._

_The Concordat Broken_

_The Disposer of Meku destroys the local temples of Sarku and Hru'u, and the threat of civil war becomes urgent. There are riots in Jakalla, Bey Su, and Urmish. Emperor Dhich'une orders his armies both to Fasiltum and to Meku. Chaos appears imminent._

_The Other Heirs_

_Rereshqala has reportedly renounced the Gold at the time of Dhich'une's accession, and remains in his keep outside Jakalla._

_Mridobu escapes Dhich'une's usurpation with his life by hiding in his father's coffin while it was being sent down river to Bey Su. He is in hiding (rumoured to be with the Urunen at the South Pole, guarded by the remnants of the Omnipotent Azure Legion)._

_Ma'in Kruthai is in Tumissa, attempting to arrange a marriage with her brother Eselne in order to form an alliance towards unseating the Worm Prince._

_Aremala flees to the Southern Continent to escape Dhich'une. Lord Muresh, formerly the leader of the Intelligence Arm of the Omnipotent Azure Legion, may be with her: he seeks support for the humans being hosted by the Urunen. Late in the year, Aremala returns to Jakalla to stay with Rereshqala. A "False Aremala" is presented to Dhich'une as a candidate for marriage, unmasked and executed._

2364-2365 AS - summer

Salarvyani forces conquer Ru and Fenul and invade the Gilraya forests. Squabbling amongst Salarvyani commanders impedes attempts to take Thraya or Jaikalor. Eselne returns with the Western army to Paya Gupa, forcing the Mu’ugalavyani to break the siege of Paya Gupa and withdraw back to Pan Chaka.

2365 AS

Scribe Alberti in Tékumel (Guardians of Order 2005)

62nd Emperor, Dhich’une, “Eternal Splendour”. Emperor Hirkane’s youngest revealed son, **Dhich’une**, a fanatical devotee of Lord Sárku who was sometimes possessed by an aspect of that Deity; killed Hirkane (57yo) in a coup; held a “false’ Kolumejalim in which no other candidates could arrive to compete; Acceded to the Throne early un 2366; country broke out into civil war. Eventually defeated by an alliance between his siblings and is rumoured to have left this Plane.

2365 AS -- Dhich'une’s Kolumejalim

It appears he had the High Chancellor, Lord Chaimira, brought before him and demanded a Kolumejalim. Enough time had passed, he said, and the Empire had no monarch. The Temple of Hnalla is obligated to provide a Kolumejalim within reasonable time limits. These had never been formally defined. The Temple of Hnalla said that a Kolumejalim could not be held as long as all of the viable candidates were not present. Dhich'une knew Eselne and Mirusiya were away at war in the north, and Princess Ma'in was no threat. Prince Rereshqala had not declared himself as a candidate. Dhich'une and his supporters then demanded that a Kolumejalim be held, whether candidates could reach it or not--national security, and all that -- and at length the temple prelates agreed. He did send invitations to both of the major heirs, although he knew they could not get free from the war and arrive in time. The thing was shoddily done, which is why many people are not satisfied just to let him remain Emperor. There have been Sarku Emperors before, and the Imperium has survived, but this was too much for the staid and sober clan-leaders of Tsolyanu. When Eselne and Mirusiya did manage to get back, they found readymade factions waiting to follow them. Not much is known about some of the internal politicking that went on during this period -- it's probably pretty shameful!

-Barker. The Blue Room Vol7#205.

The Princes have always had more power than appears on the surface. It must have taken some exceedingly delicate planning to get rid of Mridobu, but Dhich'une has had help from various places (Planes, too!), that must have got past the defences. As for the Temple of Hnalla, they were under pressure to solve the succession quickly, in view of the war in Yán Kór and the fear of Mu'ugalavyani and Salarvyani invasions. A period without an Emperor is always a shaky one, and perhaps the priesthoods decided that instability might be fine on paper, but in politics it is dangerous for the social order. Surundano was an acknowledged wimp; Arimala was a fine sculptress but not in the least interested in becoming Empress. The other hidden heirs (e.g. Taksuru) were caught off guard and unprepared. Now they've had time to plan. It will be different this time.

-Barker. The Blue Room Vol7#208.

The worshippers of the Stability deities want a solid, stable, and predictable Empire, and that a long-lived (if "lived" is the correct term?) Sarku Emperor is just the one to give it to them. I doubt whether Dhich'une had to "conspire" with the temple of Hnalla in any really conspiratorial sense; all he had to do was to do away with the present Emperor and the likely local candidate, Prince Mridobu; then he could honestly point out that the other viable candidates were far away, fighting dangerous battles from which they might not return for years or not at all. A glance toward Mu'ugalavyaand its adventures in Livyanu, and toward Salarvya and its pressure on the eastern flank would be all that would be needed to send the Stability temples scurrying for a solution.

2365 A.S. -- Adventure “The Radiant Eye of the Prince Eselne”

2365 A.S. (Summer) - Adventure “In The Wrong Hands”

News for the year 2365

-M.A.R. Barker. (1992). “News for the year 2365”.

Aremala surfaces in Tumissa

Princess Aremala Tlakotani has been discovered under the protection of the temple of Avanthe and safe within the walls of Tumissa. She had previously been under the care of Prince Rereshqala in his estate outside Jakalla, having been rescued from the land of the Urunen on the Southern Continent by a stalwart band of adventurers. She had apparently been arrested by members of the Omnipotent Azure Legion under orders from Emperor Dhich'une. She and her Imperial Sister Ma'in Kruthai are now both present in Tumissa.

Ma'in Kruthai departs Governor's palace in Tumissa

Long a guest of the Governor of Tumissa, Princess Ma'in Kruthai was escorted from the Governor's Palace (some say under the objections of the Governor) to the Temple of Dlamelish in that city, where she now resides. Her departure was precipitated by the unexpected arrival in that city of several cohorts of the Army of the Translucent Emerald, long thought lost far to the east of the Empire. How these troops arrived in western Tumissa is unknown.

Emperor Dhich'une turns on Baron Ald

In an unexpected turn of events, Emperor Dhich'une has sought the assassination of the Baron Ald of Yan Kor, whose alliance was crucial to Dhich'une's assuming power over Tsolyanu and Yan Kor. Ald escaped assassination by the Emperor of Tsolyanu, the second time for the General, who was betrayed decades ago and went on to unite the warring northern tribes into the nation of Yan Kor as a means to achieve revenge. Ald's betrayal led to massive battles between his loyal Yan Koriani forces and Imperial forces in the city of Bey Su. Ald was victorious. The Temple of Sarku in that city was sacked, and the Governor and his sister impaled.

New Prince Revealed - Prince Taksuru hiViridame

Following Ald's betrayal during the summer of the year 2,365, a new Prince of the Empire was revealed in the city of Bey Su. Prince Taksuru Tlakotani, previously Taksuru hi Viridame, of the prestigious Cloak of Azure Gems clan, Worshipper of Ksarul, and accomplished statesman, ambassador and traveller, accepted the Gold and immediately declared Emperor Dhich'une Tlakotani, Eternal Splendour, a traitor to the throne and patricide, and called for his immediate overthrow. Ald has vowed allegiance with the new Prince against Dhich'une, and brings with him to the alliance the infamous Lord Fu Shi'i and the valiant Lady Deq Dimani.

Prince Mridobu surfaces in Bey Su

Prince Mridobu Tlakotani, missing for eighteen months and long thought dead, has surfaced alive and unharmed in Bey Su. Both worshippers of Ksarul, Prince Mridobu presented his Imperial Brother Taksuru Tlakotani to the Empire along with the Lady Kalusu hi Viridame in a ceremony in Bey Su. Mridobu's appearance and support of his brother has supplied Taksuru with an unexpectedly broad base of support, including the temples of Hnalla and Thumis in Bey Su.

Dhich'une marches on Bey Su

Not unexpectedly, Taksuru's appearance and declarations brought about a quick response from Avanthar, and massive troop movements presaged a major battle north of Bey Su. While the precise results of this battle are not known, Prince Taksuru has returned to Bey Su to quell uprisings by the commoners of that city, who engaged in general lawlessness when the city forces were called north to battle.

Mirusiya still under siege in Fasiltum

Prince Mirusiya is still effectivly contained within the city of Fasiltum, where he resides with Lady Elara hi Vriddi.

Eselne escapes assassination, remains in Paya Gupa

An assassination attempt against Prince Eselne, presumably by supporters of Emperor Dhich'une, was only narrowly averted. Lord Gamulu hi Beshene, one of the mightiest healers in the Empire, was dispatched by magical means from Jakalla to Paya Gupa to treat the Prince's remains, which had been placed in magical stasis using a Magnificent Ruby Eye. The action of the dessicating poison used against the Prince was so swift that only moments separated the first contact of the poison and the complete dessication of the Prince's body into unrevivifiable component molecules. Lord Gamulu was barely able to restore the Prince to life, and both the Prince and Lord Gamulu were left seriously depleted.

Mu'ugalavyani Invasion

Mu'ugalavyani invaded the forest state of Do Chaka, using an army of the Ssu, loathsome monsters who detest all mankind, as their icebreakers to shatter the army of Prince Eselne and sack the city of Tumissa in Tsolyánu. The plan, led by a general named Tewfik, failed when a group of Tsolyáni agents (adventurers) stole the Eye of Commanding Enemies, a magic item which kept the Ssu hypnotised. When the Ssu awoke from their trance, they turned on the Mu'ugalavyani, rending the army to the four winds.

2365 AS (late summer) -

The invading Livyani arny encounters the False Plague in Tsolei and flee, bringing the plague to Livyanu.

2365 AS (late autumn)

Where things stand

It is now late autumn of the year 2,365. Many cities have been emboldened by Prince Taksuru's actions and his broad support to rise against the Emperor. Eselne's supporters have been active in the Northwest around Meku. The city of Tsuru is closed to all but Eselne's supporters. Most cities are under Imperial Martial law, and travel is greatly restricted. The empire is nearly completely embroiled in civil war.

Fighting between Sárku loyalists and other factions in Béy Sü. The “Disposer of Meku”, a Chiténg worshipper, destroys the local temples of Lords Sárku and Hrü'ǘ in the city of Muru. Whether he was in breach of or upholding the ancient law of the Concordat by preventing Dhuch’une from having the Temples of Sárku take over and control the Omnipotent Azure Legion (OAL), and create an undead Theocracy, is still hotly debated. Many cities brought under control of OAL garrisons loyal to the Worm Prince.

_While the precise results of this battle remain unknown, Prince Taksuru returns to Bey Su to quell uprisings by the commoners of that city, who engaged in general lawlessness when the city forces were called north to battle._

_Dhich'une's Position_

_Dhich'une is in a tough situation because he is not mobile and has few trusted allies. When Ald and Fu Shi'i were on his side, both were working for their own ends and not Dhich'une's. His most powerful allies are probably Vridekka and Jayargo; big, but not big enough. He needs a Fu Shi'i-level ally whom he can send out to do his dirty work. All the other Imperial Heirs are protected by allies at least equal to Vridekka and/or Jayargo, which is why they have been able to survive._

_By late autumn, a civil war has begun. Many cities have been emboldened by Prince Taksuru's actions and his broad support to rise against the Emperor. There is fighting and disorder in Bey Su. Most Tsolyani cities are under Imperial Martial Law, and travel is greatly restricted. The empire is nearly completely embroiled in civil war._

_Eselne's supporters have been active in the Northwest around Meku. The city of Tsuru is closed to all but Eselne's supporters. The Mu'ugalavyani take Pan Chaka back, but cannot take Do Chaka as the Pe Choi rise to fight them off. Additionally, the Mu'ugalavyani do not want to approach the heavy troops near Tumissa, nor Eselne's hardened army in Paya Gupa._

2366 Dohala 21st. - Prince Taksuru Tlakotáni Enters Jakálla

-as noted by Bob Dushay. The Blue Room Vol6#165.

Out here in the hinterlands, the last we'd heard of Prince Taksuru was that he had left Béy Sü to parley with Dhich'une in Dohala 2366, and had never been seen since. I figured he had been lured to his death. What happened? While we're at it, what happened to Béy Sü, which was "covered by the hand of Sarku" shortly thereafter?

The Rise and Fall of Hiriktashte

On the 21st of Dohala, 2366, Prince Taksuru Tlakotáni marched forth from Béy Sü to Avanthar with the purpose of meeting with Emperor Dhichune. He has not been heard from again.

On the 23rd of Dohala the Council of the Priesthoods dispatched an envoy to the Golden Tower to convey a challenge to the Emperor by an unspecified Imperial Prince, calling into question the legitimacy of his rule.

With this envoy travelled a retinue, including several nobles and a squad of soldiers as escorts.

Upon ariving at Avanthar via tubeway car, several members of the retinue disappeared. Disguised among them were the Baron Ald of Yán Kór and Prince Mridobu Tlakotáni. Taking advantage of the Prince's secret knowledge of his home in Avanthar, the squadron quickly entered the Golden Tower. Even as the envoy was delivering his challenge to the Emperor, Dhich'une was fleeing for his life from his half-brother and the Baron.

So it was that **Emperor Hiriktashte, "Risen to Rule",** ascended the Petal Throne. His first act was to name Ald the High General of the Empire. His second was to seize the Council of the Priesthoods in Béy Sü, and thereby set about legitimizing his hold on the Throne. All of Mridobu's staunchest supporters were called in to begin the task of organizing and assuming control of the Empire. The bureacratic nightmare of taking over an empire the size of Tsolyanu was underway.

But it was not to be. On the 25th of Dohala the trap was apparently sprung. Emerging from beneath Avanthar, through passages unknown even to the wily Mridobu (and possibly new since Hirkane was deposed), swarms of Undead emerged and overwhelmed the occupants of Avanthar. Captives were not taken and quarter was not given. Individuals who did not fall to the sword of copper were instead trampled beneath the feet of their ancestors, torn asunder by their groping claws, or hurled bodily through the windows of the upper stories to perish in the river or on the land below.

Left largely undefended by the withdrawal of the forces of Ald, Mridobu and Taksuru, the city of Béy Sü was overwhelmed and interdicted. No word nor refugee has emerged with news of what occurred. Telepathic and magical contacts with Béy Sü and Avanthar are not possible. The Hand of Sarku has covered the mouth of the city.

Rumors abound concerning the recent events, but the concensus seems to be that Dhich'une has once again skillfully executed a major coup. Beginning with his 'betrayal' of Ald earlier this year, he set the stage for the elimination of the entire Ksarul power structure, and the retaking of Béy Sü. By betraying Ald, the General could ally with Taksuru and Mridobu. Having done so, those individuals were drawn out, and destroyed.

It is now the second Intercalary day of 2366-2367. In the city of Usenanu and elsewhere about the Empire, the normally raucous celebrations are muted and reserved. Only the necessary and formal relgious rites are practiced to meet the demands of doctrine. The streets are not filled with revelers, the temples conduct ceremonies before small crowds of dour, anxious faces. All wonder what new malaise the year 2367 A.S. shall bring.

Barker. The Blue Room Vol6#167

All of this unrest has opened the gates to vigilante justice and opportunism. Looting and murder are rampant, and the great clanhouses, temples, and businesses locked their doors and stayed inside until Prince Rereshqala's troops had restored a semblance of order. Now (mid-summer, 2,367) there is quiet.

The temple of Sarku was initially sacked by mobs of looters, city guards, local contingents of the legions, and even temple guards from other temples! It was this that Lord Tekunu remembers so vividly. The temple was restored after he had left the city in the interests of order and peace between the sects. It's open for business as usual now. Prince Rereshqala apparently has no intention of destroying any sect or group; he only demands obedience to the law of the land and continued efforts to rebuild the Empire. His troops later punished a few of the most flagrant looters and those responsible for the burning of the sanctuary of Sarku. As said above, it was a good thing for Tekunu that he left the city when he did...

Almost everything Lord Tekunu relates is as it actually transpired. Here and there he differs in emphasis or minor detail from the way I recall it, but in the main his memories are accurate. What doesn't appear is what happened AFTER he had left Jakalla. This is thus rather like getting a news report for one particular day, in one particular month, in one particular year, from Sarajevo: it doesn't present a long-term, ongoing picture of what is happening. It cannot (and does not purport to) give a larger view of events across the Empire. This is to be expected.

Lord Arjai left Béy Sü near the end of 2,366. His present whereabouts on Tekumel's primary Plane are unknown. Hence, he missed much of what happened during the spring of 2,367. I can only partially fill this gap since I myself have not been back to Béy Sü to "look" with any party of players since.

Prince Taksuru was not slain, nor has he disappeared. He sent out all of his available troops (some of the Béy Sü legions, some city and temple guards, and a contingent of the Baron's soldiers from Yán Kór), plus hordes of city-dwellers armed with axes, clubs, and whatever. Dhich'une had no large garrison nearby -- Avanthar actually houses only a small number of defenders -- and in a pitched battle north of Béy Sü, the Imperial forces were defeated (barely!) and sent fleeing back into Avanthar. Taksuru regrouped and camped where he was. (It was at this point, I think, that Lord Arjai's party left the area.)

After some weeks of fruitless parleying with Eselne's emissaries, then Mirusiya's, and finally Rereshqala's, Taksuru saw that his position was increasingly fragile, and he ordered a retreat into Béy Sü. His troops are now esconced in the city and are in full control.

The "Darkness" which Dhich'une had called down upon Béy Sü was dissipated by Ksarul priests summoned from the ancient stronghold of Hmakuyal. The skies are now clear, and the mood of desolation and oppression is now gone -- replaced by a very real mood of grim apprehension mingled with some hope for a compact between the Princes.

If Lord Arjai had stayed, he would have seen the Prince's somewhat-less-than-triumphal return into the city.

What follows is essentially correct. The attempt to put Mridobu on the Petal Throne was not due to Taksuru but to a plot within the Temple of Ksarul to put a known quantity -- the stable and efficient bureaucrat, Mridobu -- on the Throne.

- On the 23rd of Dohala the Council of the Priesthoods dispatched an envoy to the Golden Tower to convey a challenge to the Emperor by an unspecified Imperial Prince, calling into question the legitimacy of his rule. With this envoy travelled a retinue, including several nobles and a squad of soldiers as escorts. Upon ariving at Avanthar via tubeway car, several members of the retinue disappeared. Disguised among them were the Baron Ald of Yán Kór and Prince Mridobu Tlakotáni. Taking advantage of the Prince's secret knowledge of his home in Avanthar, the squadron quickly entered the Golden Tower. Even as the envoy was delivering his challenge to the Emperor, Dhich'une was fleeing for his life from his half-brother and the Baron.

Actually, Mridobu had learned that Dhich'une had been summoned to the City of Sarku to attend a very special High Ceremony for the Worm Lord. Of course, it is absolutely illegal for an Emperor to leave the Golden Tower, but this would not be the first time a monarch had slipped out for some important reason. Hence, Mridobu knew in advance that Dhich'une would not be "at home," and he counted upon this for success.

- So it was that Emperor Hiriktashte, "Risen to Rule", ascended the Petal Throne. This was Mridou's choice of a throne-name. Not too prophetic, it turned out... His first act was to name Ald the High General of the Empire. His second was to seize the Council of the Priesthoods in Béy Sü, and thereby set about legitimizing his hold on the Throne. All of Mridobu's staunchest supporters were called in to begin the task of organizing and assuming control of the Empire. The bureacratic nightmare of taking over an empire the size of Tsolyanu was underway.

He didn't have to "seize" the Council of Priesthoods. He already had large numbers of the senior politicians on the temple staffs in his figurative pocket, and all he had to do was threaten Prince Taksuru's supporters with temple retribution if they objected to him. Most gave in rather meekly, but Taksuru himself was not ready to give up.

- But it was not to be. On the 25th of Dohala the trap was apparently sprung. Emerging from beneath Avanthar, through passages unknown even to the wily Mridobu (and possibly new since Hirkane was deposed), swarms of Undead emerged and overwhelmed the occupants of Avanthar. Captives were not taken and quarter was not given. Individuals who did not fall to the sword of copper were instead trampled beneath the feet of their ancestors, torn asunder by their groping claws, or hurled bodily through the windows of the upper stories to perish in the river or on the land below.

This is apparently true, although no one knows whether Prince Mridobu was among the dead. It IS known that Baron Ald escaped, fighting his way down to the tubeway cars and back to Yán Kór. He's been sighted there recently.

- Left largely undefended by the withdrawal of the forces of Ald, Mridobu and Taksuru, the city of Béy Sü was overwhelmed and interdicted. No word nor refugee has emerged with news of what occurred. Telepathic and magical contacts with Béy Sü and Avanthar are not possible. The Hand of Sarku has covered the mouth of the city.

This is true. Lord Arjai cannot have known of what transpired afterward. The Hand of Sarku has now been mostly lifted. Prince Mirusiya made an abortive assault on Avanthar but was driven back. Now, it is learned, he and Taksuru have combined with the Baron to make yet another attack on the fortress, and this time they are determined to win or perish.

- Rumors abound concerning the recent events, but the concensus seems to be that Dhich'une has once again skillfully executed a major coup. Beginning with his 'betrayal' of Ald earlier this year, he set the stage for the elimination of the entire Ksarul power structure, and the retaking of Béy Sü. By betraying Ald, the General could ally with Taksuru and Mridobu. Having done so, those individuals were drawn out, and destroyed.

This was TRIED, but the rumours are just that: rumours. He betrayed Baron Ald indeed, but the Baron got back to Yán Kór, spent some time "mending fences" within his shaky alliance of city-states and local interests, and is now once again meddling in Tsolyani politics. He is said to be with Prince Mirusiya -- though some say he himself is still in Yán Kór but has sent his leman, the inimitable Fu Hsi, and possibly Lady Deq Dimani (with her Tsolyani comrade, Lady Kalusu hiViridame) to lead the Yán Kóryani contingent.

- It is now the second Intercalary day of 2366-2367. In the city of Usenanu and elsewhere about the Empire, the normally raucous celebrations are muted and reserved. Only the necessary and formal relgious rites are practiced to meet the demands of doctrine. The streets are not filled with revelers, the temples conduct ceremonies before small crowds of dour, anxious faces. All wonder what new malaise the year 2367 A.S. shall bring.

This is reasonably true as reported. The difficulty is only that it is a "gnat's eye" view of events. Even I have no information about many of these things, particularly of what goes on inside the Sarku camp. It is now mid-summer, 2,367, and my party of player-characters has opted to go and live in a small, remote fief northeast of Sokatis on the Salarvyani border. There, they are bothered only by the Ssu, the Salarvyani, various demons, ghosts, and local peasants...

Wish them well as they bravely face the Unknown...!

A ‘hidden’ Prince Taksuru. Barker. The Blue Room Vol6#170.

Prince Taksuru is another of the "hidden" Princes. The Tsolyani encourage the great clans, temples, and powerful families to take one of the Emperor's children just after birth and bring him or her up away from the Court. In this way, te reasoning goes, the empire will be assured of candidates who are not just pampered and spoiled princelings, who have no experience with reality. For this reason, Prince Mirusiya was handed over to the Vriddi clan of Fasiltum, and he grew up there not knowing who he was until the Omnipotent Azure Legion was instructed to offer him the "Gold." The clan saw to his education, training, and progress, and if he had shown signs of weakness, they would have quietly shunted him off to live out his life as a simple clansman somewhere. They would have reported his failings to the Omnipotent Azure Legion, and the latter would never have given him a chance at the Throne.

Thus it was with Taksuru hiTlakotáni; He was raised in the Cloak of AzureGems clan in Béy Sü and was told he was a Viridame, an old and famous lineage. He was educated in the temple schools, entered the priesthood of Lord Ksarul, and was trained in a variety of fighting and scholarly skills. His tutors never told him who he was but quietly encouraged him to enrol in the subjects they knew he would need for the Kolumejalim, the "Choosing of Emperors."

He was contacted by various agents of the Throne, as well as his temple authorities, and the consensus was that he would someday be ripe for revealing: when the time came, an agent of the Petal Throne would appear and offer him the "Gold." (He now says that he guessed his true identity as early as his twelfth birthday, when his teachers discouraged him from learning music and art and directed him towards sorcery and unarmed combat skills instead.)

He remained under the eagle eyes of his clan, his temple, and the Omnipotent Azure Legion all during his adolescence. Eventually he was introduced to **Lady Kalusu hiViridame**, who was of the same lineage but of a different clan (Hand of Darkness). She is a "Marek": an ancient and secretive body of guardians who are charged with watching over important people, candidates for the Throne, and the like, without ever revealing their identities or powers. Taksuru liked her, but she was not terribly fond of him, being smitten with a certain powerful northern ruler and having higher plans for herself than "playing nursemaid" (as she put it) to a young man (who was almost the same age!).

Taksuru grew up to be a handsome, rather serious, taciturn young man. He is strong, intelligent, always balanced and watchful, and quite talented. Whether he is good enough to defeat the other candidates for the Petal Throne or not remains to be seen. He is not equal to Dhich'une in sorcery, nor to Eselne in sheer physical power, nor to Rereshaqala in diplomacy, nor to Mirusiya in leadership of troops. But Taksuru's combination of talents may be enough to survive, especially since the others are weaker than he is in one or more of the requisite talents.

The temple of Ksarul prefers him over Mridobu, who was more of a bureaucrat and less fervent in his religious observances. Prince Mridobu would have kept Taksuru from being revealed, however, because he himself wanted to be his temple's candidate, and his clique within the temple and Imperial power structure could have kept those who favoured Taksuru away from the limelight. Mridobu lost his chance when Dhich'une out-manouevred him and got to the Petal Throne after Hirkane died (or was slain). Now it's too late, probably, for Mridobu. He may even be already dead.

Taksuru is thus the only hope of the **Ndalu Clan** and related factions in the temples of Hru'u, Gruganu, and Wuru. He is acceptable to the other temples because he seems to be a balanced and non-fanatic young man, who would not rock too many boats or take out his pique upon those who disagreed with him. He can get along, it is thought, even with Hnalla, Thumis, and Belkhanu, although he has little to recommend him to Karakan, Vimuhla, or to Avanthe and Dlamelish. At least he is not openly hostile.

In view of current political developments, Taksuru has had to make an uneasy alliance with Prince Mirusiya and the Vimuhla faction. Politics does indeed make strange bedfellows. It is rumoured that some deal has been struck which leaves Mirusiya on the throne and Taksuru as Chancellor-- or vice-versa, perhaps, with Tksuru as Emperor and Mirusiya as First General. How this will play out is not yet known, if such a deal exists at all.

The Baron of Yán Kór has worked with Taksuru, after he had learned his lesson from Dhich'une's duplicity and betrayal. He may have something to say about all of this, of course, as may Rereshqala and Eselne. The other Princes and Princess Ma'in can probably be safely ignored.

2366 AS (autumn) -

Prince Rereshqala quells food riots in Jakalla and then calls for a new Kolumejalim, though still claiming reluctance to take the Petal Throne. Ma’in joins Rereshqala in his estate in Jakalla. Mirusiya remains within the walls of Fasiltum with his love Elara hiVriddi while undead besiege the rebellious desert city (though the Prince did sneak into Béy Sü to consult with Taksuru and then return unharmed). Eselne leads an army toward Béy Sü, bringing Hauma and Purdimal under hand. “Wild” Pe Choi tribes throw off the yoke of Mu’ugalavyani and Tsolyáni rule. Baron Ald returns to Yán Kór to put down revolts. Pijena and Saa Allaqi abandon their alliance with Yán Kór. The False Plague ravages Livyanu. Ssu expeditions sighted in Chaigari. Jaikalor, Sokatis, and Hekellu are hard pressed to defend against Salarvyani forces. Mu’ugalavyani soldiers hold Butrus.

2366 AS (winter) -

Eselne commands the western borders of the Empire. Taksuru reigns in Béy Sü. Rereshqala crushes the remnants of an invading force of Sárku soldiers who terrorized Jakalla and caused many citizens to flee. Mirusiya remains defiantly ensconced within Fasiltum but discovers that Elara hiVriddi was an illusion. The Livyani abandon many of their cities ravaged by the False Plague. Mmatugual Shen begin incursions into Livyani as they flee from Shenyu advances. Mu’ugalavyani raid south into Livyanu. Salarvyani soldiers command the Gilraya Forests. Fenul becomes Tsolyáni again, but the Governor only rules because the Salarvyani can’t be bothered to retake the city. Wild Pe Choi drive off Mu’ugalavyani and crush the Tsolyáni Ito clan (who were still recovering from Mu’ugalavyani brutality). The Pachi Lei are ethnically cleansed from Pan Chaka by Mu’ugalavyani garrisons. Those that have not been exterminated or fled remain in the deep forests, starving to death.

2367 AS -- Scribe Alberti in Tékumel (Guardians of Order 2005)

Fourth revealed son of Emperor Hirkane Tlakotáni, (?) Mridobu, “Risen to Rule”, a worshipper of Lord Ksárul; succeeded briefly in attaining the Petal Throne in 2367; ruled for three days. Disappeared again. Dhich’une returned. Not known yet whether reign is official - it is still under litigation in the Palace of the Priesthoods in Bey Su.

--M.A.R. Barker note from the Blue Room (Vol2)

there never was a true Kolumejalim because Dhich'une declared he had invited his rivals, and nobody showed up. This is what caused all the fuss. Afterward, Taksuru (the young Ksarul prince) declared himself in Béy Sü and gathered support. He lost it by inexperience, unfortunately, plus the hostility of his rivals and people who should have supported him. Eselne refused to give up the Gold and instead grabed most of the northwest; Mirusiya retired to Fasiltum with his Vriddi mistress Elara ( -- if it's really she?). He tried to penetrate Avanthar a couple of times but never got in. Rereshqala came out of retirement, built up an army, and took over most of the south. He tried for an alliance with Eselne but failed, then with Taksuru, who accepted but had no real troops to give him. Mridobu reappeared, managed to enter Avanthar when Dhich'une was not there (I know -- Emperors are not supposed to leave the Golden Tower, but Dhich'une sneaked away to attend a major ceremony in the City of Sarku). For two days Mridobu ruled in Avanthar, but then Dhich'une's Undead came up out of the basements and did ugly things. Dhich'une is now back, ruling, but weakened.

Nobody's been down to see the Urunen for a long time. Who knows what they're doing! The High Prefect of the Omnipotent Azure Legion fled there after Dhich'une took over, and for a while one of the minor Princesses was with him. Nobody has any idea where he is now, but the Princess retired, gave up the Gold, and went back to be a sculptress, which she had always wanted to be.

### 63rd Emperor, Mirusiya, “Resplendent Flame”

Raised by the Vriddi in secret until his early 30’s; ascended to the Petal Throne unopposed in the Kolumejalim following Dhich’une’s defeat and disappearance. A moderate adherent of Vimúhla and a strong supporter of military action and expansionism; has launched military actions against the Mu’ugalavyani and Salarvyani in response to their activities on Tsolyánu’s borders.

The surviving Princes and Princesses negotiated with each other and in 2369 AS a Kolumejalim was held with all siblings abstaining in favour of Prince Mirusiya. He promptly named Prince Rereshqala as High Chancellor of the Empire, the senior official who executes the Emperor’s commands. Prince Taksuru was made High Princeps of the Palace of the Priesthoods and senior figure in religious affairs.

2367 AS -

Eselne leaves Paya Gupa at the head of his army and takes Mrelu and Purdimal but is halted at Usenanu by forces loyal to Rereshqala. Mirusiya invades Avanthar through secret tunnels but is repulsed by undead and monsters of the Underworlds and is forced to group near Thri'il. Taksuru rules Béy Sü and holds up to 100 tsan west (near Usenanu) and over to Fasiltum. The Red Clans holds Tumissa as an independent kingdom and its warriors fight off Mu’ugalavyani incursions.

The civil war still raging (or perhaps simmering is a better word) in Tsolyánu, the Red Hats still holding Pan Chaka and Livyanu, and Salarvyani forces both raiding the Empire's eastern provinces and bickering amongst themselves. Additional details will be incorporated as more information comes in. My contacts in Tsolyánu (namely Tilekka hiVaishya of Jakalla and a few other adventurous "scholars") are rather busy at the moment, and I do not wish to take too much of their time.

## 2374 AS -- Scribe Alberti in Tékumel

(Guardians of Order 2005) narrative ends

The Salarvyáni have recently seen the beginning of a civil war. Having failed to make significant inroads into the western borders of Tsolyánu and following the death of their “mad king” Griggatsetta, there has been a monumental collapse in civil authority as the various feudal houses fight for control of the throne. Observers consider this to be inevitable given their system of government, but it is not clear which of the great families will finally be able to claim the throne or when.

What news of Baron Áld? To the north, Yán Kór is still lead by Baron Áld — though he has been fully occupied in keeping his patchwork Empire together. Through bribery, persuasion, and the liberal use of force, he has been able to avoid it disintegrating but at present the Yán Koryáni are not a threat to anyone but themselves. Current Events in Tsolyánu Unfortunately the current atmosphere of co-operation probably will not last, but for now the different factions appear to be getting along — with the exception of the Sárku faction, Dhich’uné’s supporters who are being pushed out of power.

The Military Party (supporters of the Legions and expansionism) is on the rise, as are the worshippers of Lord Vimúhla, the new Emperor’s deity.

The new Emperor appears to be a moderate, willing to work with members of other faiths. This is important because the years of civil war have severely depleted the military and organisational resources of the Empire and a time of healing is certainly required.

Mu’ugalavyáni Opportunism

Seeking to exploit the Empire’s weakness, the Mu’ugalavyáni invaded the western border provinces and showed their usual brutal efficiency. Their shocking atrocities against the Páchi Lei both on their line of march and after they captured the city of Butrús have confirmed their peculiar tendency to xenophobia. This reputation and behaviour in the south served them less well in the north; in Do Chaka, resistance to the Mu’ugalavyáni was much more effective than it had been in the south. This was largely because of the very effective attacks on their supply lines by the “wild” Pé Chói (independent communities who owe no allegiance to any human state). This seems to have come as a surprise partly because of the ferocity, the quality of their strategy, and the surprisingly large number of Pé Chói warriors (it had previously been assumed that the “wild” Pé Chói were an irrelevant and marginal group). Regular and irregular human forces, some of which were the personal troops of the **Ito clan**, were also heavily involved in this bitter deep forest campaign. Whereas the Mu’ugalavyáni still hold a large piece of Pan Chaka, including the city of Butrús, their attack on Tumíssa never made real headway and their northern armies were forced to retreat. Reports suggest that extremely heavy losses were incurred on both sides and that some kind of internecine split may have developed in the Ito clan but, as always, the Ito prefer to deal with matters privately.

The Mu’ugalavyáni are currently involved in the invasion of Livyánu. This has seen not only the use of a magically-created plague that killed a significant percentage of the population (see Lords of Tsámra), but also the use of black stones that can temporarily turn an area magically barren (a serious disadvantage for the Livyáni, who depend on their superiority in sorcery for their defence). Although the black stones can help the invaders take a city or fortification, it does not deprive the large number of Livyáni magicians of their skills or power once they move on. Although most of Livyánu has been overrun and there is a puppet government in place, Mu’ugalavyáni control is not as secure as might be expected. Livyánu resistance appears to be extremely perhaps even astonishingly well organised, with significant resources in intelligence, magic, and even military forces still remaining beyond the reach of the Mu’ugalavyáni. This resistance movement seems to be increasing in strength, contains quite a large number of magicians, and is competently led by an individual called “Fireface” (a reference to the scarring often suffered by survivors of the artificial plague). The war in Livyánu is far from over.

The Salarvyáni Tide Ebbs Out to the East, the well-known and respected Governor of Sokátis was instructed to stop the Salarvyáni incursions and given permission to use the local legions. He gathered the local legions and led them in an invasion of Salarvyá. The Salarvyáni stopped him quickly and pushed them back. They made extensive gains and the border war left them in control of the Gilráyan forests and threatening Thráya before they were stopped. Sokátis was sacked twice and the situation looked grim for the Empire in the East. Fortunately, the military gathered legions in the south, marched them east, and drove them in an attack that drove well across the traditional border. They took the city of Rü and looked capable of marching all the way to Koylúga. This effectively stopped the conflict and both armies retreated to their traditional borders with very little gained on either side.

It is the year 2374 A.S. (After the Seal, the foundation of the Empire). The Empire seems more stable and peaceful than it has for many years, but the wounds of the past are deep and vengeance is a dream for many. This is a time of hope and of reconstruction; the Tsolyáni Empire has survived its time of trouble and looks to regain what once it possessed.

Most recently, reports have started to arrive in Tsolyánu of some type of previously unknown non-human that are appearing in increasing numbers in the northeast. These reports suggest that these creatures are highly aggressive and sentient. Naturally some think this is mere rumour and that either internal conflict in the human tribes or poor harvests in the far north are causing the migrations. Others fear that some new and terrible alien threat is rising.
