Hláka “the Furred Flyers”

*source: The Tekumel Bestiery p.39*

The Chayengar Range in Kilalammu, just southeast of the Dry Bay of Ssu'um . Colonies of Hlaka have also been discovered recently in the oceans south of the equator. 

The Hlaka are flyers . They have leathery wings and greyish or dull brownish fur similar to their larger and heavier cousins, the Shanu'u. They stand about four and a half to five feet tall . Their heads are flattish triangles, with three frontally placed, bright blue eyes with nictitating membranes set in a bony crest. At he sides and backs of their heads they have a sort of furred ruff which conceals their hearing organs . They are bipeds, with two arms to which their wings are attached, rather like abat. Their legs are short andbowed, and they also possess apowerfultailthat ends in a bony, rapier-like point . This they sometimes coat with a poison derived from a local tuber. Hlaka can speak, but their comprehension of mathematics is not good, and they are therefore oftenunable to describe the numbers of an approaching army accurately. They tend to be neutral to human affairs, although young ones often emerge from their territory to serve in human armies.

In combat, they use swords, light javelins, and crossbows, as well as their tails, and they also frequently carry stones and clay pots filled with burning coals to drop on foes below. The Hlaka are skittish and nervous, and will fly away from battle on the slightest pretext. They are also terrified of ships and sea-travel . These creatures are warmblooded mammals, have two sexes (males : 55%, and females: 45%), and raise their young in caverns and eyries in their mountain crags . Their religion is complex and quite unintelligible to humankind: it involves the placing of coloured stones in geometric patterns on high, flat mountaintops at certain astronomically predicted times . Hlaka do not comprehend human society very well, make poor slaves, and always eventually return to their homeland.

The Hláka are flyers. They have leathery wings and grayish or dull brownish fur similar to their larger and heavier cousins, the Shánu'u. They stand about 1.4 to 1.5 meters tall. Their heads are flattish triangles, with three frontally placed bright blue eyes with nictitating membranes, set in a bony crest. At the sides and backs of their heads they have a sort of furred ruff which conceals their hearing organs. They are bipeds, with two arms to which their wings are attached, rather like a bat.

### Construction  
Locale and social class distinctions : Rural/tribal: [Hlaika families do not live in  
isolation ; they are found only in communal eyries]

Village/small town: High caverns in the face of a vertical cliff, open at the front and possessing several internal chambers dug into the mountain at the rear ; food is cooked at the front of the eyrie, and this is where the inhabitants congregate ; the young are raised in the small rear chambers ; the Hlaka excavate and burrow but build nothing of stone or wood

Large town/city: Same, except larger and still more complex; there are no shops or administrative areas or caves in the eyrie-cit, and there are also no temples ; the Hlaka religion revolves around the placing of coloured stones in geometric patterns in a flat space on top of high mountain at fixed times of the year ; Hlaka cities can only be approached by flying creatures or expert mountaineers.

Hláka are flying mammalians of roughly human size. They originate from near the Ensis star system (Eta Orionis). They are cowardly, yet curious, and their usefulness as military scouts is unsurpassed.

Flying beings with leathery wings and grayish fur. They have flattened heads, and three eyes with nictitating  
membranes, set in a bony crest. A furred ruff conceals their hearing organs. Two arms & two legs and supplemented by a powerful tail fitted with a poisoned rapier-like blade. They are skittish and nervous, usually flying away from battles. They cannot use armor, are weak on the ground, hate walking, and abhor sea voyages. Their curiosity and constant chatter make them annoying companions, and downright dangerous when silence is needed.
