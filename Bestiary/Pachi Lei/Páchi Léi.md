The thickly forested region of Pan Chaka in southwestern Tsolyanu and southeastern Mu'ugalavya.

These four-legged, four armed creatures are a greygreen colour, shading to dark green and almost black along the spine. Their pear-shaped, doughy-looking bodies are covered with small knobs and protuberances that give them a knobbed, bulbous look . Pachi Lei range from about five feet to a little over six feet in heighth. They have two large, platter-shaped eyes which allow them to see well in the dark, and their massive, prognathous jaws are filledwith teeth. In their Pan Chakan forests, these beings live in treehouses of carved and polished wood, maintain a dualistic religion (N'rg, who islike Hnallaand Thiamis, or A'lsh,who resembles Ksarul and Hr%i'ii), and spend much of their time with their families . In spite of their ferocious appearance, thus, this species is generally peaceful and gentle . Indeed, they are psychologically closer to humankind than many other, more humanoid species of Tekumel. They are loquacious and interested in politics andsocial interaction, andmany ofthem have attained high posts in the priesthoods, the clans, and the government of Tsolyanu . They use human weapons with ease and are often found in the armies . They also have an atrophied sixth sense that permits them to see "wrongnesses" : secret doors, ambushes, and traps. For historical reasons, the Pachi Lei hate their neighbours, the Mu'ugalavyani. They make docile slaves and are frequently employed as chamberlains, clerks, etc. Most eventually desire to return to their Chakan home, no matter how high a post they reach. This species reproduces by budding: at certain times during a four-year cycle each individual exudes spore-like spermatozoa which fertilise the "egg-pods" on the bodies of other individuals . These lumps become pod-like extrusions, and in about 250 days these burstopentoreveal aviable infant .The Pachi Lei have no families as such, although small "families" of six to eight individuals do live and work together.

### Construction  
Locale and social class distinctions : Rural/tribal: One-room chambers skillfully grown" into the bobs of the great Ebzal trees of the Pan Chakan forests ; large "houses" are grown down near the forest floor, while the smaller dwellings of younger adu Its are created higher up in the trees; ladders of woven vines connect these dwellings aerially

Village/small town: Same ; larger congregations of treedwellings are built around an open grassy knoll whic h is used as a temple

Large town/city: Same ; copying human models, an area on the floor of the forest is set apart for an open-air marketplace; in such human cities as Butrtfs the Pachi Lei actually build houses of polished and carved wood along human lines ; these have one storey and several chambers but no . particular floor plf;after_the Mu'ugalavyam massacre of the Pachi Lei m 1,565 this species has taken to walling their towns with log palisades and surrounding them with ditches filled with the "Food of the Ssu"

These four-legged, four armed creatures are a gray-green color, shading to dark green and almost black along the spine. Their pear-shaped, doughy-looking bodies are covered with small knobs and protuberances that give them a knobbed, bulbous look. Páchi Léi range from about 1.5 meters to a little over 1.8 meters in height. They have two large, platter-shaped eyes which allow them to see well in the dark, and their massive, prognathous jaws are filled with teeth. In their Pán Chákanforests, these beings live in tree houses of carved and polished wood, maintain a dualistic religion (N'rg, who is like Hnálla and Thúmis, or A'lsh, who resembles Ksárul and Hrü'ü), and spend much of their time with their families. In spite of their ferocious appearance, thus, this species is generally peaceful and gentle. Indeed, they are psychologically closer to humankind than many other, more humanoid species of Tékumel. They are loquacious and interested in politics and social interaction, and many of them have attained high posts in the priesthoods, the clans, and the government ofTsolyánu. They use human weapons with ease and are often found in the armies. They also have an atrophied sixth sense that permits them to see "wrongnesses": secret doors, ambushes, and traps. For historical reasons, the Páchi Léi hate their neighbors, the Mu'ugalavyáni. They make docile slaves and are frequently employed as chamberlains, clerks, etc.  Most eventually desire to return to their Chákan home no matter how high a post they reach. One curious feature of Páchi Léi behavior is Biyúrh, a term translatable as “running berserk.” This may happen to any individual at any time and for reasons unknown. A Páchi Léi suffering from Biyúrh begins to quiver, shriek, and then runs amok killing everything in his path with whatever weapon is handy. Once an individual has returned to normal (usually within a few minutes), however, he is not punished, and nothing more is said of the incident. This species reproduces by budding: at certain times during a four-year cycle each individual exudes spore-like spermatozoa which fertilize the "egg-pods" on the bodies of other individuals. These lumps become pod-like extrusions, and in about 250 days these burst open to reveal a viable infant. The Páchi Léi have no families as such, although small "families" of six to eight individuals do live and work together.

source: the Tekumel Sourcebook, near the end of section 1.740 (Law, The Police, Punishments And The Arenas):

"One curious feature of Páchi Léi behaviour is Biyúrh, a term translatable as ”running berserk.” This may happen to any individual at any time and for reasons unknown. A Páchi Léi suffering from Biyúrh begins to quiver, shriek, and then runs amok killing everything in his path with whatever weapon is handy. Once an individual has returned to normal (usually within a few minutes), however, he is not punished, and nothing more is said of the incident. This phenomenon naturally leaves human judges in a quandary: some treat the offender as "not guilty by reason of insanity," while others impose Shámtla and even criminal penalties.”

perhaps reasons not entirely unknown, given this from section 1.832 (The Priesthoods), again near the end of the section:

(referring to sacrifices left by Páchi Léi at their tree shrines) When these objects begin to take up too much space, a Páchi Léi may simply sweep the place out, scattering all previous offerings down into the leaves and detritus at the footof the tree.These “sacrifices" may include gold coins, gems, and even precious fire opals, and the space around the base of a temple-tree may be littered with a veritable fortune. The Páchi Léi do not pickup these items, saying that “their value in this world has been rendered null by the god.” Unfortunately they also forbid humans from collecting this wealth, and a Páchi Léi who sees humans near a temple-tree may go into the state of Biyúrh (Sec. 1.740). Only the most daring thieves thus venture into the forest in search of these hidden shrines.”

the term "Biyúrh" about the Pachi Lei. The book defines it as a berserk-like state, without going into further details. I’d never heard of this before so I searched for it online and discovered an unofficial article that describes it in one of the Visitations of Glory zines ([https://www.tekumel.com/vog03_03.html](https://www.tekumel.com/vog03_03.html)).

The Páchi Léi, four-legged forest dwellers, live in jungles. They fit well into Tsolyáni society, being somewhat passive and calm. They originate near Arcturus (Alpha Boötis).

The thickly forested region of Pán Cháka in southwestern Tsolyánu and southeastern Mu'ugalavyá.  
Doughy eight-limbed creatures with four arms and four legs (with prehensile toes). Their huge, platter-like eyes give them nocturnal vision. They have a natural "sixth sense" that gives them a chance to detect ambushes, secret doors, etc. within 3m if they are searching. They are sociable and interested in human affairs. Despite their four arms, they can only attack once per round, though they can hold alternate weapons in their other limbs.
