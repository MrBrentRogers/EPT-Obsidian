**Flame Dragons** of the Time of the Dragon Lords: Minions of Shenésa & Mrúgga.

*Demonology \- Swords and Glory Book 1 p.176*  
**The Flame Dragons**: these are flying, scaly, reptilian, 3 .5 m long creatures of a gleaming orange-red hue . They breathe flames out to a range of 12 m, and if a hit is scored, damage is done according to table E. They also fight with short spears and one handed longswords, doing damage according to table D . A member of this race may thus strike once with a weapon and also  
use its flaming breath once each combat round . The Dragons demand the sacrifice of 1-5 living, intelligent beings before they will aid the caster.

A related race that serves Vimuhfa's Cohort, ChitAng, Is the Winged Serpents of the Conflagration . These red and black flying reptiles average 3 m in length ; they never melee but remain in the air, attacking with spells, fire arrows (their bows are equivalent to short composite bows), or their flaming breath (as for the Flame Dragons) . Their arrows do damage according to table D and set inflammables ablaze on a D100 roll of 1-80 .

Both Vimuhla and ChitAng also can call upon another race, the strange Hré-Niriu, who appear as flat sheets of roaring flame that flow along the ground at a speed of 20 m per combat round . They are about 2 m wide and 3 m long . The Hré-Niriu have no weapons but set fire to anything combustible in their path . Anything higher than 1 m from the ground is safe, however, unless it  
is inflammable . A being touched by one of these creatures is incinerated . They are repelled by a Vallation (no . 68\) of water or ice, and a spell of Congelation (no . 111\) will slay them . They will not cross water wider  
than 1 m and deeper than 10 cm, moreover. This species bargains for flammable substances (torches, oil, wood, cloth, etc .) and loves nothing better than a raging fire . The Hr9-Niriu are unpredictable, however, and a D10 is rolled each turn : 1-6= they obey the agreement ; 7-8= they return to their own Plane ; 9-10 \= they turn and attack the caster or his/her party. They never distinguish between the property of the caster and that of his/her foes, burning all with undisguised pleasure .

Haichútl: minions of Mrúgga.  
Kholúr: unknown.  
Chóhlu'arth: minions of Mrúgga.

### Mennuké: The Watcher

“The Master of Secrets,” and its power is that of observing all things which transpire in the Many Worlds.   
Appears as a single round sphere, no external organs or other markings, greenish-grey in colour, and hanging in the air like a bloated bubble. It has no voice, but its words are perceived directly within the mind. It has the power of Pansophism \[the knowledge of all that transpires\], and will speak the mysteries of the Many Worlds, including that past and future, as we know them. Unfortunately, he is know to equivocate upon occasion and to tell less than the entire truth, delighting in riddles and vague oracles. When it has spoken as it wishes, it will depart as a dream departs upon awakening.
