These semi-intelligent birds are covered with brilliant plumage used for feather capes, helmet-crests, etc. They will normally attempt to flee (70% chance), but if cornered, they may be subdued, rather than killed. A subdued Khéshchal is worth a great deal: 3-4,000 Káitars. This bird is not domesticable but is kept in some zoos; the many-colored Livyáni varieties are the most prized.		
- Bethrom.

Dense forest.
Semi-intelligent bird-like beings which are covered with brilliant plumage used for feather capes, helmet crests, etc. Their feathers are thus highly valuable (1d20 x 100 kaitars?) They are wary, and fear humans. They can be captured and tamed (worth even more than a dead one's plumage).
They are quite large birds, bigger than seagulls, but not so large as turkeys.

# Küni (falcons)
- Intro to Tekumel. 
aka hai; Kuni; Kyni 
![[Kuni - The Tekumel Bestiery p.13.png]]
(3) Kuni are genetically engineered falcons, a breed originally created by the ancients, they have enhanced intelligence and communication skills. Dhala hiMorutess has a kuni bird called Chai. Dhala was given his egg by her aunt (a noted naturalist). By a combination of dedication, skill and luck, Dhala was able to hatch the egg and raise the chick. The adult Chai is partly trained but willful, he will scout and report to Dhala, and his keen gaze can spot a drawn sword at a quarter mile. Chai has bonded with Dhala and she can communicate with him well, using vocalizations and hand gestures.

**Game mechanics**: Chai has not been professionally trained, which means that he is somewhat unreliable and prone to making his feelings known. This unreliability, combined with the practical limits of its intelligence and endurance make it interesting without being overpowering.

These brownish birds have a limited intelligence, plus the ability to speak in simple terms if trained by a bird-trainer. They are thus useful as hunters and spies, since they can report back on the disposition of troops, terrain, etc. They can be trapped, lured down with aromatic Tsúral-buds (a 50% chance), or shot down with blunt-headed arrows smeared with a sticky substance. The Küni will try to escape but cannot fight. They are inedible. 	
- Bethrom.
Dense forest and mountain crags. A larger sub-species is found in the northern mountains of Yán Kór.  
Brownish avians with a limited intelligence plus the ability to speak if properly trained. They are useful as hunters and spies both, since they can report back to their masters on troop dispositions, terrain, etc. They can be trapped, lured down with Tsural buds, or shot down with blunt-headed arrows smeared with glue. Kyni are extremely wary. Kyni are the size of terns or small hawks.
