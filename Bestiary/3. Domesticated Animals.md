Domesticated and found almost everywhere. Its favorite habitat is a mountain meadow in the temperate zone. These are domesticated six-legged, warm-blooded mammals. They have long, triangular heads and stand about 1.2 meters tall. They are herded and used for meat and wool. Their wool is usually grey but may be brown, black, or tan.

With no riding beasts available, all travel is done on foot - or one of the creaky, slow-moving carts pulled by domesticated Chlen . Trade is thus conducted mainly by caravans of slave bearers, men trained to carry heavy loads for 30 to 40 miles per day at a trot.
…
Warriors in the Tsolyani Empire fall into various categories, but the usual garb is a helmet, breastplate, and greaves of Chlen-hide, all dyed azure blue with the herb Ksekkura . Since iron and steel are scarce, the hide of the Chlen beast (a great, slow-moving hippopotamuslike animal) is used both for weapons and armour : fresh Chlen hide is subjected to various processes known only to the tanners' clan, whereupon it becomes extremely pliable and can be moulded into almost any shape, cut in the form of a weapon, etc . Another series of processes then turns this substance into something harder than bronze but slightly softer than iron . It is this which is used for the majority of arms and armour in all parts of Tekumel.

A Chlen-pulled cart can hold the weight of about ten heavy men : 303,000 Kaitars . The larger cart, drawn by two or more Chlen, can carry the weight of 30 men: 909,000 Kaitars.

Almost every continental land area. These great, slow-moving six-legged beasts are found all across Tekumel. They have flattish, horned heads with a splayed beak. A Chlen fights only if attacked . If exhausted or beaten into submission, it can be domesticated by an animal trainer. Its horny integument is the universal substance for armour and weapons; once treated with secret processes to mould it, another series of processes are used to harden it into something just a little softer than iron . Pieces of Chlen-hide are taken from a living animal, and it then takes two weeks for the animal to regenerate this, much as a human regrows a fingernail. Chlen are used to pull carts, once tamed, but their slowness makes them usable mainly for loads which are non-perishable and not needed in a hurry. Most transport on Tekumel is done by bearer slaves .

On Tékumel itself, the "Time of Darkness" brought calamities: shifts in the seabeds, volcanism, widespread storms, and destruction. After a lengthy struggle to maintain civilization (called "The Latter Times"), the societies of Tékumel declined and reverted to a pre-industrial age. Without metal, people resorted to the malleable hide of a ponderous rhinoceros-like beast (the Chlén) that had been imported for the zoological gardens of the wealthy space-explorers. Chlén-hide is peeled off the animal (which is not harmed and grows more); this thick hide is "tanned" with chemicals. It is lighter than iron or bronze and has the hardness almost of aircraft plastic, and it thus makes fine armor and weapons.

**Animal Handling** (WILL/ -4, Status Varies)  
The character can herd, diagnose, care for, and train animals. Falconry is a common sport among nobles of various cultures, and may also be open to hunters from backwater nations. Falconers use the Küni-bird, which is semi-intelligent and can be trained to talk. Specify the type of animal te character is skilled at handling.
- Birds, including the semi-intelligent Küni (Medium Status)  
- Dogs, including the semi-intelligent Rényu (Medium Status)  
- Chlén (Low Status)  
- Cattle (Low Status)  
Herding and maintenance attempts take a variable amount of time. Diagnosing a sick or injured animal takes at least one turn.
To teach an animal a new trick, check against the animal’s WILL minus its INST or SEMI modifier (see section 16.0). The GM may add additional modifiers depending on the trick’s complexity. Each attempt takes at least one full day

Melee weapons enhance characters’ fighting abilities. On Tékumel, typical melee weapons are made from the hide of the Chlén-beast (p. 174).

**2.370 Transport** 
The only draft animal in this part of Tekumel Is the six-legged, armoured Chlen beast; cf . Sec. 1 .960. In order to understand the economic value of this creature, some further data must be provided. A Chlen Is approximately 5-6 m long from snout to spiky tail. It stands some 3-4 m high, weighs 7,0009,000 kg, lives 5075 years, consumes about 200 kg of straw and forage per day, and drinks about 170-200 litres of water dally . It has a gestation period of 21 months, and It produces no more than one calf at a time, born oviparously in a leathery sac. The Chlen Is relatively docile and will fight only if attacked or tormented. It Is rather slow, moving at a speed of only 3 km or so per hour, and it cannot work or pull a cart for much more than 5 hours per day. Its great strength makes it an important economic resource nevertheless . It is too expensive an animal to be owned by most peasant families, but the lands of the Five Empires and most of the smaller states are owned In large tracts by the clans, the temples, the governments, and great private landholders . These vast estates are admirably suited to cultivation with the aid of the Chlen . Wherever It Is not feasible to use a Chlen (e.g . on a very small tract of land), there is no other recourse but to have slaves or members of one's clan or family pull the ploughs manually. 

Bulk commodities are transported mainly by Chlin cart. These come In two sizes: a smaller one which Is drawn by one Chldn and carries 600900 kg of cargo, and a larger kind pulled by two of these animals, which holds 1,8002,700 kg . These average only some 15-20 km per day.

#### Just how big is a Chlén Beast?
![[The Tékumel Project - Chlen.png]]
The two lines in the above picture represent the approximate height of the average Tsolyáni male - who stands about 1.68M tall, IIRC.
Our figures are 28mm to the eye, so about 30mm to top of head (give or take.)
So however tall the average male is - assuming it is one of those lines - then that line will represent 30mm on the Chlén model.

I have a sculptor waiting for instructions so I need to figure this out...

IIRC, Chlen-beasts may be given some Aira-grass in their fodder to chew as a soporific, and then they begin to cut away at the thick integument on their backs.  This is a multi-person job, involving long poles with hooks, and curved blades to keep working at the built-up hide, which can be quite thick (a foot? Maybe more?). It's a skilled operation; if you don't cut enough away, the layer you miss gets hardened and (IIRC) much less useful if you get it later. If you cut too much away, you can hurt the Chlen-beast (though not much; kinda like sheep in that regard). You want to get it just right, peeling away a nice, thick layer of malleable hide. For the Chlen-beast afterwards, they actually appreciate it, because the built-up hide can be an annoyance.  Not sure if this is a result of Latter Times genetic engineering, but it's how they are today.

"Funny there is a plenty of hits on Chlen hide and its properties (it does not burn, it does not float, it dissolves slowly when buried etc.) on Blue Room messages, but only one vague reference to how Chlen beasts give birth (message 746) where it is told that a meteor shower (!) may cause them to drop calves prematurely. They sure are easily scared (must include some stampede encounters to liven up the Sakbe-road tedium)."

Plains and open woods. The largest varieties are found on the Plain of Towers.
This big, gentle, six-legged herbivore is related to the Tsi'íl. It is smaller, however, and not harmful, even if attacked. It has a sad, wistful, rather deer-like face, reddish fur, and a short stumpy tail. Its meat is gamey but tasty.
