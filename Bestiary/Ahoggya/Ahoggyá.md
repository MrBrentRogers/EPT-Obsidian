Ahoggyá "the Knobbed Ones"

_source_ The Tekumel Bestiery p.38

The Sharuna Lowlands of Salarvya, the Flats of Gyogma in Haida Pakala, and Onmu Tle Hlektis in the far southeastern ocean are the chief enclaves of this species. Ahoggya are knobbly, brownish, bristly, tremendously strong creatures, about four or five feet in height . Their bodies are like a thick barrel surmounted by a domed, armoured carapace that makes them look rather like a stocky mushroom . Set equidistantly around the body just under the rim of the carapace are four powerful arms,which end in hands having three fingers and a thumb. Between these arms they have four pairs of independently moveable eyes . Their eating, breathing, and sexual apparatus occupies the middle of their body on each side, and at the base of the body, four thickly muscled, bowed legs project outin a permanent crouch . The Ahoggya are intelligent and speak, though with a ghastly accent . They have eight sexes, but their mating practices are still a mystery to other species . They have a reputation for bad temper, boisterousness, and crudity, and they prefer to be left alone, but will sometimes help humans, though never gladly. As far as is known, they have no religion whatsoever. Once, the Emperor Durumu, "the Copper Blade of Sarku" (ruled 1,747- 1,809 A.S.) sent a body of scholars to ascertain the Ahoggya deities. They concluded that these creatures had no gods at all, whereupon the Emperor classed them as "animals" for citizenship and census purposes, an insult the Ahoggya never forgot . The Ahoggya fight in human armies, often bravely and loyally, as long as they are paid . They employ short spears, maces, flails, and other weapons, as well as magical devices.

### Construction  
Locale and social class distinctions : Rural/tribal: Single-storey, 1-room wattle-and-daub huts built up on stilts above the bog, pitched thatch roof ; the center of the floor is open so that a stout ladder can be let down .t o permit ingress and egress

Village/small town: Same ; larger huts around a central dance ground ; a village is usually surrounded by quagmires, poisonous plants, and a fence of venomous hooked spines

Large town/city: (Only in Omnu TleHlektis) : large, round one-room log huts, plank floors, conical thatched roofs; there is no market or a business area; all commerce is done from workshops in private homes; there are also no temples -- no one has yet discovered even whether the Ahoggya have gods - but the ceremonial dance ground is prominent ; towns are walled with log palisades and guarded by moats filled with deadly serpents and other creatures.

**The Eye**: Do any of the nonhuman races have their own ethical attitudes?

**MARB**: The Ahoggyá’s ideas on right and wrong are as clear as swamp mud to humans. The Tinaliya are righteous little prudes, loyal to the social goals of the Lords of Stability."

Knobby, brownish, bristly creatures 4-5 feet high, but tremendously broad and strong. Their upper body is surmounted by four powerful arms, and their eyes and eating apparatus lie beneath these under a horny protective carapace. They have four thickly muscled legs.
Their gruffness, rude ways, and rank smell make them unappealing to humans. They are generally fearless. The Shen detest the Ahoggya.

The Ahoggyá originate from the vicinity of the Achernar star system (Alpha Eridani). They look like a furry barrel that has sprouted four arms and legs with a bony carapace on top. They live in the low-lying coastal plains and swamps.
