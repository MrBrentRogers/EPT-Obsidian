Source material from Phil's Pe Choi essay, relevant sections of which follow.
... Long before Man had stretched out his hands to the stars the Pe Choi had developed space flight and the torque-stress interdimensional drive.
It was on the advice of the Pe Choi that Man steered away from the deadly worlds of the HlutrgÃº, then a localised but ferocious and powerful spacefaring species. They were again instrumental in keeping human ships away from Pelagus (sigma Sagittarii), which was inhabited by a race so dangerous and inimical that no species could approach them with impunity.

The forests of Do Chaka, between Mu'ugalavya and Tsolyanu . Other enclaves exist on islands in the southern oceans.
Of all the nonhuman species, these slender creatures are the most friendly to humankind. They range from five and a half to over six feet tall, have two powerful rear legs, a segmented tail, and two sets of forelimbs, the uppermost of which is used for manipulating tools and weapons and for social purposes, while the central pair of limbs is employed for heavier work . Their heads are long and narrow, with two large green eyes, a tapering proboscis, and two fan-like ears at the rear of the skull.
They thus resemble the seahorse of ancient Earth. They have two sets of "lungs," one in the torso, and the other in the abdomen. The breathing holes for the latter are located along the inner thighs, which gives rise to the Pe Choi's fear of wading or swimming in water deeper than two feet or so! There are three sexes: males (40%), females (35%), and neuters (25%). The chitin of the males is a gleaming jet black, while that of the females is bone-white . Neuters are black as well, but with a greyish tinge. Pe Choi have excellent vision and hearing, and they are psychic as well . They can detect the presence of other beings within about six feet of themselves, but are not telepathic (unless they have studied this art) . They also sense whenever a fellow Pe Choi has been killed at distances up to two or three miles, and they then exact a terrible revenge if the deed was done unjustly (as they perceive justice) . In the wilds of the Chakan forests, these creatures have their own intricate society, worship their own deities ("the Father of Nests," who embodies features of most of the Lords of Stability, and "the Black Old One," who encompasses the Lords of Change), and live in harmony with their forest environment. Those who come out into the Five Empires to live are fond of joining human organisations, however: they are found as priests, clansmen, bureaucrats, merchants, and soldiers - all walks of life . They copy human dress and customs, often becoming "more human than human." Because of their great sensitivity and psychic talent, they frequently join the scholarly contingents of human temples, where they become
accomplished sorcerers . They serve in the armies of the Five Empires, too, and make good soldiers, fighting with javelins, jag-edged swords, and crossbows. In a military context, the deaths of others of their species does not seem to disturb them . All in all, Pe Choi sometimes seem a little too sophisticated and "delicate, but in general they are liked and respected by their human counterparts.

### Construction  
Locale and social class distinctions : Rural/tribal: Small, grey-green, dome-shaped one-room houses made of a bodily secretion mixed with chewed leaves, twigs, etc . ; a house contains only a clay hearth and wood or clay platforms for sleeping

Village/small town: Same; villages consist of clusters of houses connected by hidden forest paths; there are no shops or markets, and commerce is done by a sort of barter ; there are also no temples; in their own areas the Pe Choi do not build temples in their towns, although there are certain shrines hidden back in the forests

Large town/city: The Pe Choi do not build larger towns or cities; enclaves in Paya Gupa prefer human built houses.

The Pé Chói are beautiful insectoids with considerable psychic talents from Procyon (Alpha Canis Minoris). These six-limbed beings are 6’ to 7’ tall, they have two legs and four arms, and they can use all four arms at once. They easily join human society.

Of all the nonhuman species, these slender creatures are the most friendly to humankind. They range from 1.7 to over 1.8 meters tall, have two powerful rear legs, a segmented tail, and two sets of forelimbs, the uppermost of which is used for manipulating tools and weapons and for social purposes, while the central pair of limbs is employed for heavier work. Their heads are long and narrow, with two large green eyes, a tapering proboscis, and two fan-like ears at the rear of the skull. They thus resemble the seahorse of ancient Earth. They have two sets of "lungs," one in the torso, and the other in the abdomen.  The breathing holes for the latter are located along the inner thighs, which gives rise to the Pé Chói's fear of wading or swimming in water deeper than .6 meters or so! There are three sexes: males (40%), females (35%), and neuters (25%). The chitin of the males is a gleaming jet black, while that of the females is bone-white. Neuters are black as well, but with a grayish tinge. Pé Chói have excellent vision and hearing, and they are psychic as well. They can detect the presence of other beings within about 2 meters of themselves, but are not telepathic (unless they have studied this art).

The forests of Dó Cháka, between Mu'ugalavyá and Tsolyánu. Other enclaves exist on islands in the southern oceans.  
The Pe Choi are graceful and agile. They stand approximately seven feet tall, have six limbs, and are easily recognized by their fan-like ear appendages and prognathous mandible-jaw. Males are glossy black, females white.Their hearing is excellent.  
If wounded, their chitinous exoskeleton takes longer to heal. Double all normal costs for healing spells and time needed to heal. They have a double set of lungs, the lower pair of which is situated in the abdomen with its breathing openings between the overlapping segments of the upper tail. A Pe Choi can drown, therefore, in about 1m of water, and can never swim. The Pe Choi do not live as long as humans, normally living only 20-30 years. They also possess a telepathic ability which manifests itself in two ways; they can sense the presence of living beings within 2m of themselves, and they know whenever another Pe Choi dies within 5 km. They are cultured and clever, and progress well in the hierarchies of man's societies.

### D&D5e Compatible

Pé Chói "the Listeners"

Medium humanoid (based on D&D5e Thri-Kreen (MM288))
AC: 15 (Natural armour)
HP: 33 (6d8 +6)
Speed: 40 ft.

STR 12 (+1)	DEC 15  (+2)	CON 13 (+1)	INT 14 (+2)	WIS 12 (+1)	CHR 7 (-2)

Skills: Perception +3, Stealth +4, Survival +3
Senses: Darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 13, blindsight 5 ft.
Languages: Pé Chói and Common
Challenge 1 (200 XP)

Extra Arms: You have two sets of arms which allows you to have multiple weapons at the ready (longsword, shield AND a two-handed sword). You can use a bonus action to make an additional attack with an additional weapon. The weapon’s do not need to be light as per Two-Weapon Fighting.

Limited Telepathy: Pé Chói can psychically sense the presence (but not thoughts) of creatures within a 5 foot radius. It also allows them to sense when another Pé Chói (only) is killed within the past 24 hours out to a five-kilometer radius.

Slow Healing: Pé Chói heal at half the normal rate (rounded down), as it takes longer for their exoskeleton to heal than flesh.

Environmental Limitation: Water Phobia: Pé Chói breathe both their mouths and through spiracles on their abdomen and tail. They can consciously control the spiracles, closing them temporarily, but it is hard to maintain this (requiring Concentration checks, DC 10 each round), as they have an instinctive response to stress that involves opening the spiracles as wide as possible for maximum oxygen. They are unable to learn to swim (though a Pé Chói could potentially float for as long as it could hold its breath), and even shallow water can drown them.

Multiattack. The Nyaggá can make three attacks: two with one weapon, and one with another.
Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (2d4 +1) Slashing damage.
Spear. Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft. or thrown 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d6 +1) or 6 (1d8 +1) piercing damage if two handed.
Shortbow. Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 +2) Piercing damage.
