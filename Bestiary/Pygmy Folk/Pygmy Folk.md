# Pygmy Folk (Nininyál)

(Tsolyáni: Nininyál ‘the Little Ones’; Yán Koryáni: Nyenu)  
“To bargain with a Pygmy is to lose one’s purse” Tsolyáni proverb.

- Empire of the Petal Throne by M.A.R. Barker, ©1975

The Pygmy Folk are generally friendly to man, but can sometimes be cruel, are often capricious, and are renowned for their greed and avarice. They are ferocious opponents if attacked and will fight to the death, but will resort to traps and ambushes to avoid battle if faced with a larger group. Nininyál are cunning and decisive, but also materialistic (greedy), emotionally volatile, and cruel.

## Physical Attributes

Small, only about 3 feet tall (.43 to .91m) and rodent-like, the Pygmy Folk possess a sharp-featured face, large ears, greyish or blackish fur, two muscular rear legs, two upper arms with three-fingered claw-like hands (plus a thumb), and a vestigial tail. Their sight and hearing are excellent—they can see easily in pitch darkness. There are three sexes: males (55 percent), females (15 percent) and hermaphrodites (30 percent), who dwell in families but produce no offspring. Their communal life is both complex and intense.

## Stereotypes

The Nininyál are infamously avaricious and clever merchants; they live up to the old Tsolyáni proverb of ‘to bargain with the Pygmy Folk is to throw away your purse’. They are also utterly without any sense of honour as known to the citizens of the Five Empires, stealing anything not nailed down, betraying anyone, even each other, to gain wealth, and are incapable of keeping a promise or vow made under even the most solemn of circumstances and invoking the most dreadful of demons and deities. They are also bad enemies. The Tsolyáni were ambushed by them many times during the recent wars and claim that they tortured captives for sport and ate them alive. The Yán Koryáni say these tales are exaggerated, but admit that they are masters of ambush and do not follow the age-old rituals of war as known to human nations.

## The Reality

The Nininyál have a ‘dog eat dog’ culture and have little regard for each other’s life and property, let alone other species, and cannot comprehend why humans put up with weaklings and idiots to the extent that they do. To humans the seem overly cruel, in speech and actions. They are self-centred, but will cooperate with others to mutual benefit. They will argue vehemently over everything, using all kinds of invective and insults among themselves and barely managing to stay on the right side of politeness when dealing with humans, but once an argument is over they quickly forgive and forget any harsh words; it is just the way they communicate. They are not really kleptomaniacs, but if they are sure they won’t get caught then they will help themselves to other people’s valuables without a qualm.

## Clan and Lineage

No human clan accepts Pygmy Folk members, and no Pygmy Folk could cope with giving up any of their material wealth to such an organisation. The Pygmy Folk organise themselves by burrow, with each complex being ruled (as far as such a thing is possible) by a council of elder females whose main role is to regulate the cycles of vendetta and personal vengeance arising from the many incidents of violence and theft that occur within the settlement. Females have a social advantage among Pygmy Folk, and are regarded as somewhat more reliable than the males and hermaphrodites.

## Enclaves

Pygmy Folk live in subterranean burrow-like towns and cities in the northern plains of Yán Kór.

## Religion

The Nininyál have a large and complex pantheon equivalent of any human deities which involves sacrifice by mob violence. Little else is known for sure by any non- Nininyál observer. Human temples will allow Nininyál to worship if they wish, but always keep a very close eye on them in case they run off with temple valuables and know that any expressions of faith are more than likely a ploy in some kind of scam or plot.
