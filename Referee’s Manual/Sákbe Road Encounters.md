When an encounter takes place while the PCs are travelling along a Sákbe road, it indicates that the PCs experience an especially noteworthy incident. Sákbe roads can be very crowded, especially near cities and at night near their intermittent guard tower plazas, and so most of the fellow travelers the PCs pass by during a given day must be ignored.
