d100: City Encounter: 

01-05 Ruffian/Bandit/Criminal: Usually belongs to a gang of 2d10 persons. Desires henchmen, accomplices, or aid. May cheat or harm the party. May try to pass himself/herself off as  
a reputable merchant, artisan, foreigner, etc.  

06-10 Tomb-Robber: A member of one of the ancient, quasi-legal clans involved in this illicit occupation. One of a group of 2d10. Seeks accomplices or aid. May deceive the party, steal the spoils, or leave comrades to face the wrath of the Tomb Police.  

11-15 Slaver: A member of one of the least prestigious professions in the Five Empires. Usually has d100 overseers, guards, scribes, and henchmen. May desire caravan guards, auctioneers, etc., but may also wish to enslave the betterlooking members of the party. Caution is advised. Such work is  
dangerous, and those who work for slavers are looked on with contempt.  

16-20 Tax-Collector: Assigned to large regions from which he/she collects revenue. Usually accompanied by d100 scribes, soldiers, and clerks. Seeks bodyguards, “enforcers,” spies, scribes, accountants, and household personnel. 

21-25 Caravan Master: Belongs to one of the mercantile or transport clans. Desires watchmen, guards, scribes, accountants, experts in foreign languages and cultures, and investors who will accompany him on journeys.  

26-30 Arena Official: A member of one of the entrepreneurial clans involved in the business of the Hirilákte arena. Seeks gladiators, entertainers, and guards. Not a prestigious occupation, but useful for fighters who cannot find other employment.  

31-35 Artisan: Usually a clan elder or master craftsman of one of the manufacturing clans. The GM will determine his exact occupation. He may hire people trained in the clan’s profession, shop assistants, guards, travelling agents, etc. 

36-40 Local Merchant: As for artisan, above. May require shop assistants, guards, porters, etc. Not an exalted profession. Under this category come pimps and panderers in search of recruits. 

41-48 Soldier/Officer: From a legion, a temple guard unit, the local militia, the Sákbe-road guards, or the tomb police. May seek recruits, scouts, or spies. This person may also be unemployed (perhaps a 25% chance) and in search of companions for an expedition into the Underworld, or off to some place known to contain treasure. May have 2d10 comrades.  

49-58 Priest: Roll randomly for his/her sect on the table in 14.3.1. May seek converts, agents for a temple mission or project, spies, or recruits for the temple guard. The temples also own businesses and lands, and these require guards, scribes, craftsmen, administrators, laborers, etc.  

59-60 Assassin: The quasi-legal assassin clans may seek assistants for a mission. There is a 5% chance that an assassin will reveal his true identity. After a mission is over, there is a 5% chance that an assassin will maintain contact with temporary assistants, and if the project fails, his employees will be left to take the blame. There is barely a 1% chance that hirelings will be asked to join the assassin's clan.  

61-66 Scholar/Mage: Universal/Generic/Temple level. May seek assistants, apprentices, experts in various fields, bodyguards, agents to help in acquiring certain items, etc. 

67-75 Agents of a local noble, official, high clan leader, government bureaucrat, etc. May desire bodyguards, housepriests, servants, artisans, experts, and the like. May also need help in political intrigues or some mission. It is hard to meet one of these high officials personally, but their agents watch for likely recruits for their master’s entourage.  

76-80 Agent of a high noble, Imperial Prince or Princess, senior priest, etc. As just above: such people employ small armies of household troops, personal servants, house-priests and sorcerers, physicians, scribes, and other personnel. They may also have political objectives which are best served by low-level agents and hirelings. Some are collectors of curios, connoisseurs, or scholars in their own right. Almost any objective is possible!  

81-85 Espionage Agent: From a secret temple or political faction or an intelligence-gathering organization. There is a 30% chance of the visitor revealing his/her identity and objectives. May need agents, spies, experts, etc., to help in some specific mission, or even clerical help! Recruits may be given training or sent off on a project at once. Membership in such a body may also be revealed only to the player(s) involved, while the others are not told.

86-90 Foreign Agent: As just above, except that the NPC’s goals may not be favored by the local authorities! Such people often pose as merchants or scholars, and they use native agents to achieve their missions.

91-95 Foreign Noble: An ambassador, legate, priest, visiting clan leader, or even an exile. May need local expertise, translators, bodyguards, and assistants. They may also have missions that can best be carried out by natives of the country 

96-98 Nonhuman: Roll for the species from among the friendly races, or possibly the N’lüss or the Nom, on table 14.1.1. The individual may be a merchant, scholar, mercenary, ambassador, etc. Members of the same race will be preferred, but humans are sometimes employed as well.
May need translators, guards, experts, or local assistants.

99 Alien Agent: A representative of one of the neutral or inimical races. As above, except that the assignment bodes ill for humankind! The agent will conceal his/her/its identity. Tasks may include selling the deadly drug Zu’úr, smuggling, or political intrigue. The agent has 2d10 accomplices and possibly a larger network of spies and
employees.

**100 Pariah Agent**: A representative of the one of the proscribed sects of the Pariah Deities. Small cells or groups of these still survive here and there. Their objectives are like those of the inimical nonhuman races. Recruits are screened before being told of the sect or initiated into it. Even their agents may not know what masters they serve, and disguises and deception are taken as matters of course. Again, a larger network is probable.
