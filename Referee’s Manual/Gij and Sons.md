## Gidj and Sons

Gidj and Sons are an interplanar mercantile corporation. They do not so much trade across time as across planes. They are entirely clandestine, and only have a permanent shop in the city of Dlash in Livyanu. They occasionally hold secret auctions where literally anything can be purchased. But they don't accept cash, Visa, or American Express.

It appears that Gíj and Sons have two faces, a technomagical one, where they trade between the planes, and a human one that trades in the spoils of war.

For instance, Lord Páruvez Kórudu, who a Syndic, and a senior partner in the trading firm of Gíj and Sons was known to have diverted the treasures of Holísi artefacts after a victory to the firm. They included “a cornucopia of antiquities – no, miracles: complex metallic devices, little pictures on plaques of imperishable, jewel-like stuff, shiny tubes, rich fabrics, books inscribed upon leaves of silvery metal, bars of rare iron – a metal more costly than gold on Tékumel – and handfuls of less valuable gems and coins. There were fourteen other, identical chests.”

Gíj and Sons also meddle in politics and wars and appear to have access to bioweapons and their antidotes, for instance “a small, oval bottle, with traces of a yellowish fluid still inside. It bore the imprint of Gíj and Sons.” That was some sort of cure for the Plague that afflicted Tsoléi. They later make a bid for a Ssú technomagical weapon described as a mine (“This was the tripod surmounted by two cones, mounted base to base, upon gimbals”), along with various Eyes, and various small hand weapons (including a rod like device).

Most significantly, they supplied the Black Stones that The Red Hats of Mu’ugalavyá used to suppress magics in areas of Livyánu they invaded. Those were made by the intelligent alien race known as “Demons of the Dark”. Gíj trades with all and with everywhere.

They appear to have also handled Great Devices of the Ancients, battlefield weapons, aircars, and even permanent portals to other planes for their customers.

Along with items, Gíj also sell information.

Their shop is described as a classical Tsouk – “They set off down the stairs and past the chamberlains at the gate of the resthouse. At this hour there were few passers-by, and the only smells were of smoke, cooking, and dust. Later, other, less-pleasant fragrances would be added, as the city came to life.

Tsáuhl came to a halt at last before a drab, buff-hued complex that consisted of ramshackle sheds joined by covered passages and walkways. These seemed to have neither plan nor purpose. Bales, boxes, and bins overflowing with unknown contents stood everywhere. In many ways, this place resembled shops throughout the Five Empires. A flight of three cracked steps led up to a cavernous hall where visitors removed their footgear and squatted cross-legged on mats of scuffed red fabric. Boys scuttled to and fro with trays of sweetmeats and beverages; older youths pulled the cords of sweep-fans to stir the turgid air; and others carried goods and samples in and out. In the shadowy depths, more clerks glided silently to and fro, occasionally emerging to serve some fortunate customer.”

Gíj also has a place called The Retreat where there are factories where Gíj and Sons “creates its androids and manufactures its best products”. This is divided into areas, the easiest to visit is the First Chamber of Creation, managed by The Vat Master. It is full of machines and cauldrons and portals large enough to create an object the size of a cart.

From there are also portals to “off world” manufactories, including at least one in a space station.

It may be that Gíj are clones, produced in those factories?

Underneath are various tunnels, catacombs and a Tsurum.

The firm appears to be staffed by “not quite normal humans”, and that comes over “We are but extensions of our employer. We use designations that name our positions. I, for example, am a ‘Purveyor.’ You may call me that or address me simply as ‘Gíj.’ All senior members of the firm are ‘Gíj.’ The term is antique and luxuriant with connotations.” He favoured Tsáuhl with a bland smile. “Your estimable clan-cousin, the junior clerk, Anjésh Gómu, may one day achieve the title of ‘Gíj’ should he rise to higher status.”

The Infinitesimal Point of Thazai

Created by one of the lesser-known Undying Wizards, this initially appears to be an unremarkable dagger with a plain black sheath and a brass guard.

The blade is however quite unusual. It is an inch wide and four inches long and is a slightly iridescent grey in colour. It appears to fade away at the edges and toward the point; it is not transparent as such, just not entirely there. When moved it appears to be reflecting something in its surface, but not any object actually anywhere near it, and when viewed edge-on it disappears entirely. Viewed point on the blade appears as a tiny glittering point of light.

A scholar with knowledge of planes and portals will recognise that the blade is in fact a variety of interplanar aperture and is set askew to the rest of the material universe in one of the mystical directions. It gives a prickling ‘static’-like feeling when near naked skin and it does appear to be a narrow hole in the fabric of space-time through which small objects may be inserted. The point is extremely sharp and very hard to see – anyone investigating the properties of the blade must roll vs Dexterity or accidentally prick or stab themselves.

Used as a weapon the blade has the same characteristics as a stiletto with an additional x1 damage. It totally ignores all armour and most magical defences, only spells that guard against demons and other planar magic will deflect it.

Magicians who recognise the nature of the blade and practise with it can make a Ritual Magic skill roll after a successful hit, reduced by the target’s magic resistance. If this succeeds, then (success margin x5) points are taken from the target’s magical energy pool in `soul damage’. If the pool is reduced to zero in this way no further damage can be done. Being immaterial the blade is useless for parrying and all defence rolls are at -4, and any attempt to use Attack Weapon is at -6, except against shields. It is highly suitable for Deceptive Attacks and any such attack made is at +1.

The blade can penetrate any material, but only to a depth of four inches, and as it has no sharp edge as such it cannot be used to slice. For example, it would be possible to use the knife to carve a hole through a door, but making an inch long hole with each stroke it would take a while to make one big enough to climb through.

If the blade is taken though a Nexus Point all kinds of unfortunate interactions are possible. The usual one is that the point of the blade becomes a trans dimensional lens, sucking in any material object nearby and diffracting it in the fourth dimension, turning it inside out. It leaves the non-corporeal parts of the object intact; the now disembodied soul(s) of the knife’s wielder can get a good view of the own innards as they are whisked off into by the winds of limbo to the wastes beyond the Ultimate Pylon…

The blade is also useless against Mihalli. They can see the blade for what it is and can use their Spheres of Immediate Eventuation to destroy it. A particularly vindictive Mihalli may take the risk of creating a Nexus Point in front of the blade by way of a shield.

Thazai designed these daggers as a defence against demons, which are often insubstantial, invisible and/or incorporeal and immune to weapons of quotidian materials. It is not known how many of these blades were made. One is on sale at Gíjj and Sons in Dlásh at 45,000 kaitars, another is owned by the Temple of Grugánu (though where they have put it or who is carrying it they aren’t saying) and it is thought one of the Emperor’s personal bodyguards carries one in case of demonic assault.
