# Incandescent Blaze Society  
zealots that hold to the ancient tenets of the Flame – destruction and annihilation – but they temper these with a shrewd understanding of political necessities.They are barely tolerated by the  
Imperium – and by the lords of the Four Palaces of the Square in Ssa'átis in Mu'ugalavyá – but they do occasionally prove useful, and their fanatical devotion makes them excellent assassins and soldiers. As might be expected, the best of the Vimúhla-worshipping Legions are riddled with followers of the Society.

# Order of Devouring Conflagration:  
Less known and much less numerous are the devotees of the Order of Devouring Conflagration. Members are usually priests (and a few priestesses). They hold that the scriptures enjoin burning and devastation, and to live as normal citizens is to live a lie. Therefore it is the duty of true believers to remain within the temple precincts until such time as Lord Vimúhla shall summon them to carry out the wholesale burning and destruction that will be His reward at the end of time. The members of this group are often charged with the dreadful duties of performing the human sacrifices that are the hallmark of the High Rituals of the Flame.

# the Scroll of the Blaze Revealed  
A still smaller number follow the Scroll of the Blaze Revealed: a schismatic party of extremists who lead an ascetic life within the walls of certain monasteries hidden in the Chákan forests, in the mountains north of Bey Sü, and in the wilds of western Mu'ugalavyá. This sect, founded by one Késhkuru Gama'án in late Engsvanyáli times, holds that its members must remain aloof from the mundane world. Outsiders – even other followers of Vimúhla – who penetrate its sanctuaries are slain, and it is believed that  
each member must also choose a time to sacrifice himself or herself in the ever-living flame. Some say that this is done by casting lots, while other sources indicated that each follower’s fate is determined astrologically by comparing certain features of the person’s horoscope with the positions and aspects of Tékumel’s second and smaller moon, Káshi, whose reddish hue identifies it as "the planet of Vimúhla."

# the Three Fingers of the Flame  
In Yán Kór there is a further secret society, the Three Fingers of the Flame, which bears a resemblance to the Incandescent Blaze Society, but which combats all of the other groups on various little-understood theological grounds. This has taken on political overtones in the light of the present war between Tsolyánu and the Yán Koryáni. The Baron’s equivalent of the Omnipotent Azure Legion, the Surgéth, uses members of this small society as assassins and spies.
