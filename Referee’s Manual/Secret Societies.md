## The Secret Society Missions

a- You are contacted by a secret society of your temple. It is of paramount importance that you intercept an enemy agent and get the package that agent is carrying. No one of the society can do this, they are too visible.  
(in reality the society wants the enemy to think that some random thief got the package and if you die, well... no traces to them)  
b- It is your job to guard an important personage, make sure that your life is lost before theirs or it won't be a life worth living. Perhaps this is a prince or princess who was never revealed, perhaps it's someone whom the society cannot afford to lose.  
c- There's a dungeon worth delving in. Unfortunately, the society cannot be there, and since all property belongs to the Empire it would be best if you remained anonymous until it is disposed of. You are expendable, but there are great rewards if you succeed.

# Incandescent Blaze Society
**Vimúhla & Chiténg**  
Strong political action; supports Emperor Mirusíya and Military Party; sometimes works with Lord Karakán's Sword of Righteousness.  
Zealots that hold to the ancient tenets of the Flame – destruction and annihilation – but they temper these with a shrewd understanding of political necessities.They are barely tolerated by the Imperium – and by the lords of the Four Palaces of the Square in Ssa'átis in Mu'ugalavyá – but they do occasionally prove useful, and their fanatical devotion makes them excellent assassins and soldiers. As might be expected, the best of the Vimúhla-worshipping Legions are riddled with followers of the Society.

# Order of Devouring Conflagration:  
Less known and much less numerous are the devotees of the Order of Devouring Conflagration. Members are usually priests (and a few priestesses). They hold that the scriptures enjoin burning and devastation, and to live as normal citizens is to live a lie. Therefore it is the duty of true believers to remain within the temple precincts until such time as Lord Vimúhla shall summon them to carry out the wholesale burning and destruction that will be His reward at the end of time. The members of this group are often charged with the dreadful duties of performing the human sacrifices that are the hallmark of the High Rituals of the Flame.

# the Scroll of the Blaze Revealed  
A still smaller number follow the Scroll of the Blaze Revealed: a schismatic party of extremists who lead an ascetic life within the walls of certain monasteries hidden in the Chákan forests, in the mountains north of Bey Sü, and in the wilds of western Mu'ugalavyá. This sect, founded by one Késhkuru Gama'án in late Engsvanyáli times, holds that its members must remain aloof from the mundane world. Outsiders – even other followers of Vimúhla – who penetrate its sanctuaries are slain, and it is believed that  
each member must also choose a time to sacrifice himself or herself in the ever-living flame. Some say that this is done by casting lots, while other sources indicated that each follower’s fate is determined astrologically by comparing certain features of the person’s horoscope with the positions and aspects of Tékumel’s second and smaller moon, Káshi, whose reddish hue identifies it as "the planet of Vimúhla."

# the Three Fingers of the Flame  
In Yán Kór there is a further secret society, the Three Fingers of the Flame, which bears a resemblance to the Incandescent Blaze Society, but which combats all of the other groups on various little-understood theological grounds. This has taken on political overtones in the light of the present war between Tsolyánu and the Yán Koryáni. The Baron’s equivalent of the Omnipotent Azure Legion, the Surgéth, uses members of this small society as assassins and spies.

# Hokun Spy Network
Equally proscribed like the worship of the Pariah Deities, but apparently more secular in its ambitions – the Hokun are plotting to take over the Five Empires and assert their “natural” dominance over base creatures like Homosapiens. Again, membership is by invitation only.

# Society of Blue Light

The Blue Light society is better able to cooperate with other temples (being seen as more open in the sharing of knowledge) and is considered 'harmless'. Of all the societies of the Lord of the Blue Room, the Blue Light society has the capability of working with members of other temples (outside the more 'sinister' Trinity.) They thus have access to information that the other groups don't. Despite the fact they probably work with other temples more often, still either very little is known about them or they are considered minor enough not to have people wonder about  
their actions.

# Refulgent Blue Curtain Society

Is secretive, but there is a good amount known about them. They are respected, and feared for their influence behind the scenes.

# Copper Tomb

# Inner Sphere

# Ndalu Clan

# Pariah Sects
(Underground) This extremely secretive affiliation of worshippers and their agents are never seen openly – working through dummy groups and retaining a low profile. They do constantly seek to recruit the high born and well-positioned.
