Each of the Five Empires has a secret place that no outsiders may enter.  
Dlash in Livyanu: one does wonder about the "One of Fears." Quite possibly a name for one of the three known Pariah Deities, rather than a "new" Pariah Deity.

## Hlikku in Yan Kor:

is an ethnic-religious site, occupied by a sect of highly skilled Assassins.

## Mu'ugallu in Mu’ugalavyá:

is an ethnic, with religious overtones: a cult-site for the military secret rituals of Lord Hrsh

## Songyal Island in Salarvya:

is some sort of cult site, probably devoted to an aspect of Shiringgayi who has to do with the sea -- rater like Mretten and the other sea-goddesses of the southeast.

## Tsolyanu has two, with the City of Sarku and the city Hmakuyal in the dead volcano.

The City of Sarku and Hmakuyal are cult headquarters: both very ancient and full of fanatic worshippers. Sarku's minions hold special pilgrimages and celebrations in his secret labyrinths every year, and nobody knows what the Inner Temple of Ksarul does deep in the walls of the crater around Hmakuyal.

Various scholars have visited and written about both of the Tsolyani secret sites, and there was even a fellow who pretended to be a priest of Ksarul and got into some of the depths under Hmakuyal. He knew all the right languages, rituals, and details, and managed to get into). Unfortunately, the fake priest of Ksarul didn't have powerful enough blocking spells, and the priesthood read his mind, identified him, and then gave him what he sought: they created an illusion -- for his mind alone -- of a vast labyrinth filled with magical devices he could never understand, books he could never read, people and creatures he could never speak with, and endless blank hallways that led nowhere. I think he's still on display somewhere in one of the outer halls of the temple.  
The Red Hats know better than to try to breach the isolation of Dlash. They know about the place from centuries of living next to Livyanu, and they don't want to create problems where none currently exists. Militarily, they could invade Dlash easily, but there are some things even the greedy generals of Ssa'atis don't want to arouse. -Barker, The Blue Room Vol.3#85.
