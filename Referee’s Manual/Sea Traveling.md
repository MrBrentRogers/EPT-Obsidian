# Encounters at Sea
## ENCOUNTERS AT SEA

from: Mercator - Traveller

During the ship's time at sea it may encounter another ship or perhaps wreckage. The GM may roll once per week, with the rolled encounter occuring at a point during the journey decided by the GM. If a dash is shown, then no encounter occurs. The encounter may be routine, or may involve interaction and roleplaying. At the whim of the GM the encounter may relate to the current adventure, or serve as the springboard for one. The referee may want to use the reaction table from the encounter section of Traveller book 3 to determine the precise reaction of a ship's crew.

types include small, medium, large and very large galleys (the  
Séscha, Srügánta, Qél, and Zírunel) and small and large sailed  
ships (the Hrú and the Tnék).

# Navigation

from: Mercator - Traveller

There are no compasses or sextants to help sailors find their way, successful sea captains must learn by heart the many routes that cross the Mediterranean. Some of these routes are recorded as travel guides in books that warn of navigation problems, ideal sailing times and local sea conditions. Navigators try to keep the coast in sight at all times, it is in this way they keep track of their position, looking out for landmarks on the route. At night the ship pulls up on a beach or into a bay where it can shelter for the night, the crew camping on the beach, When storms threaten, ships likewise head for the safety of land. Some of the larger ports have lighthouses, guiding ships toward them rather than warning of dangerous reefs.

Once a ship has left port it will be at sea for a week. The navigator must also make a skill roll to successfully chart a safe course for the vessel. He creates a dice result that the helmsman may have to then overcome with his pilot skill.

## Types of Ships
There are three types of military ships: the small Séscha, the bireme Srügánta, and the trireme Qél. The Séscha carries about 60 rowers, 20 marines, and 3 officers. The Srügánta carries about 100 sailors, 30 marines, and 5 officers. The Qél has 180 sailors, 50 marines and 10 officers. Even larger ships exist: e.g. the giant quinquereme (the Zírunel) with 300 oarsmen, 100 marines, and 10 officers. A score of 01-35 on a d100 indicates a Séscha; 36-65 = a Srügánta; 66-95 = a Qél; and 96-00 = a Zírunel. Rowers are Light fighters, Marines are Medium. A Séscha is captained by a Heavy fighter; the Srügánta by a Heavy fighter with 2 Heavy mates; the Qél by a Heavy officer with +2 attack and defense skill (+.8 danger rating) with four Heavy mates; and the great Zírunel by a Heavy captain with +2 attack and defense skill (+.8 danger rating), with 6 Heavy comrades. There is a 30% chance that 20% of any fighting crew will be of Heavy warriors as well. Military ships all have a 50% chance of d6 Generic sorcerers trained in battlefield magic.
