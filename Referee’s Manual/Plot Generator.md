## THE BASIC STRUCTURE OF AN ADVENTURE

Each plot consists of four acts. Each act has one or more scenes – usually five. Acts should be created so that an experienced set of players could manage an act per three to six hour session. The scenes consist of a location, atmosphere and “mood”, player characters, NPCs, dramatic events and the occasional red herring or comic relief.  
The overall structure for the acts in this temple is:  
Act One: Establish Context and Drama: What is Going on and Why am I Involved?  
Act Two: Introduce Danger and Hints to Resolution: Who Might Be Behind This?  
Act Three; Escalation of Dangerous Situations and Search for Tools and Allies: How do We Get Out of this Situation? What is Really Going On?  
Act Four: Resolution and Set Up for Next Adventure: What Happened When the Dust Cleared?

The individual scenes might consist of the following in Act One:  
Scene One: A backstory cutscene establishing the danger (theft of a rare artifact from the Temple of Ksarul by Shunned Ones – much to the social embarrassment of the Temple which now must to turn over the Latter Times relic to the OAL within a fortnight for use in the war against Mu’ugalavya – the stakes are high.  
Scene Two: Players are called in by their patrons to retrieve the item, negotiating for social status and tools to help them – this is the calm before the storm.  
Scene Three: Following the trail of the loathsome Shunned Ones through the Tsuru’um Beneath Bey Su – to the Tubeway Car system – random combat and flailing around (perhaps include a subplot concerning other temples who would like to embarrass the Temple of Ksarul for political advantage – do one more cut-scene for players so they realize the stakes. Are climbing… ).  
Scene Four: Meet with Additional Danger – Black Ssu showing up at the Tubeway car station – and trying to eliminate players who have to defend and escape.  
Scene Five: Successful but pyrrhic victory over the Black Ssu – regrouping in the Tubecar and plotting next moves – how to “track” the Shunned Ones and reach them before they get to their noxious Domed Cities and things get really complicated.  
There are numerous directions to take the drama. The Shunned Ones might only be in the employ or services of some hidden power (say the Hokun). The middle acts of the adventure would establish and unmask the “real” villains. This might have significant ancillary effects on the situation, etc.

## Table: Dramatic Action Sequence (Choose 1 to 3 for Some Adventure or Danger in Middle of the Story)

1. A rooftop chase across a Temple complex (with optional attacks from all sides by henchmen of the Villain or sub-villain)
    
2. A precarious fight on a partially collapsed ruin or Tsuru’um com plex (“If we make too much racket the whole place will collapse around us!”)
    
3. A game of cat and mouse with a determined and skillful assassin through the streets and back alleys of a city or large complex – trading shots and narrowly missing one another
    
4. A magical “booby trap” that springs on someone involved with the players – but all of their lives in danger (“I told you not to open that jewel box until we make sure it isn’t cursed… nooo!”)
    
5. Just when the players appear ready to vanquish a foe (main or alternative) – a large number of reinforcements show up to whisk them to freedom – thwarting the players (OAL officers making an inopportune appearance work well)
    
6. A nightmare sequence (see spell “Nightmare of Terror”) or a diabolical attack by a Succubus or Incubus (or both?!?) to really catch a player or players off guard (“Get out of m y head!”)
    
7. The Emperor or his Agents (OAL) show up to arrest you on suspicion of <something> - and you have to escape them so that you can “prove your innocence” – it may involve melee and magical escape
    
8. The undead attack you at a moment of weakness or frailty – triggered by your getting too close to the “truth” (pick which kind depending upon the power of players – make it hurt)
    
9. A special assassin is dispatched – a Yeleth or a magical creature (demon or servitor race) – to quiet you permanently – the assassin is waiting for you in a place that you sure was “safe” from infiltration
    
10. You are ambushed or forced to take part in a bloody and dangerous battle in an unfavorable location (legionnaires storming walls to get at you, there is close hand-to-hand combat, frantic flight to safety, and possibly the death or one or more personas – the stakes really are getting high!)
    
11. A party of Ssu show up and they want something you have (and which is likely required to unmask the Villain or slow him down in some way) – the Ssu are most insistent however!
    
12. A mysterious Mihalli shows up with an Orb of Immediate Eventuation and forces the players through some display of magical violence or effect to bargain or barter with it for something valuable – possibly fighting them if things really go poorly during negotiations

6. A blow hard and raconteur who attaches himself to the party at some point and just won’t shut up and is “all talk” (modeled on Falstaff from Henry V)
    
7. An aged aristocrat with an overactive libido and few charms who develops a burning passion for one of the party and untiring in her pursuit

9. A hypochondriac acquaintance who is forever worried of “coming down with something” but who grudgingly comes along to help players when need (all the while complaining about his health)
    
10. A ridiculously out of shape and flabby “military hero” who tries to impress the players constantly and glom onto their successes – debauched, debased, and slightly desperate for a social victory and redemption

10. False planted clues that point to one or more people within the party or within the broader social circles they are allied with (nothing like fear and doubt to divide the party)

## Table: Tools or Devices Propelling the Story (Hitchcockian “MacGuffin”)
