## THE BASIC STRUCTURE OF AN ADVENTURE

Each plot consists of four acts. Each act has one or more scenes – usually five. Acts should be created so that an experienced set of players could manage an act per three to six hour session. The scenes consist of a location, atmosphere and “mood”, player characters, NPCs, dramatic events and the occasional red herring or comic relief.  
The overall structure for the acts in this temple is:  
Act One: Establish Context and Drama: What is Going on and Why am I Involved?  
Act Two: Introduce Danger and Hints to Resolution: Who Might Be Behind This?  
Act Three; Escalation of Dangerous Situations and Search for Tools and Allies: How do We Get Out of this Situation? What is Really Going On?  
Act Four: Resolution and Set Up for Next Adventure: What Happened When the Dust Cleared?

The individual scenes might consist of the following in Act One:  
Scene One: A backstory cutscene establishing the danger (theft of a rare artifact from the Temple of Ksarul by Shunned Ones – much to the social embarrassment of the Temple which now must to turn over the Latter Times relic to the OAL within a fortnight for use in the war against Mu’ugalavya – the stakes are high.  
Scene Two: Players are called in by their patrons to retrieve the item, negotiating for social status and tools to help them – this is the calm before the storm.  
Scene Three: Following the trail of the loathsome Shunned Ones through the Tsuru’um Beneath Bey Su – to the Tubeway Car system – random combat and flailing around (perhaps include a subplot concerning other temples who would like to embarrass the Temple of Ksarul for political advantage – do one more cut-scene for players so they realize the stakes. Are climbing… ).  
Scene Four: Meet with Additional Danger – Black Ssu showing up at the Tubeway car station – and trying to eliminate players who have to defend and escape.  
Scene Five: Successful but pyrrhic victory over the Black Ssu – regrouping in the Tubecar and plotting next moves – how to “track” the Shunned Ones and reach them before they get to their noxious Domed Cities and things get really complicated.  
There are numerous directions to take the drama. The Shunned Ones might only be in the employ or services of some hidden power (say the Hokun). The middle acts of the adventure would establish and unmask the “real” villains. This might have significant ancillary effects on the situation, etc.
