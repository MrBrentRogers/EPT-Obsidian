**The Pylons**  
Finally, there seem to be barriers that prevent travel to  
particular areas. Where the deities or creatures that rule  
these Planes have them blocked off, the scholars of the  
Temple of Belkhánu talk about the Pylons or the  
Barriers. Whether or not these objects exist in reality, or  
whether these are simply human names for complex  
phenomena that defy human comprehension is unknown.  
The Pylons certainly exist in the sense that one cannot  
cross into the realities which the Pylons block: the  
Planes from which Tékumel and its sun originated; the  
series of Planes where the Chíma rule; and others which  
are far out and away. One can travel the infinite  
possibilities of Tékumel's reality, but one cannot pass  
Beyond the Pylons. The last who might have done so  
were the long vanished Lords of the Latter Times, and  
they either took their great knowledge with them, or left  
it to decay into uselessness.

## Barrier Pylons and the Creation of Tekumél's Pocket Dimension

```
		-Not canon (fanon?) from Alex in The Blue Room Vol.3.
```

Present below is Alex’s totally speculative account of the Barrier Pylons, their origin, and purpose The Barrier Pylons.  
A running theory is that the Barrier Pylons were created as a proximate result of the fracturing of space-time that resulted in Tekumel's plunge into the n-space (i.e. pocket dimension) it now inhabits. The net effect is that these structures protect these collapsed planes from the encroachments of the Pariah Deities, who have run amok in our "normal" space-time envelope (henceforth: o-space).  
The shattered or torn o-space fabric is not easily traversed by the Pariah Deities due to the dimensional folding caused by the space-time warping. The barriers act as safety valves between Tekumel's current dimension (n-space) and the one it came from (o-space).  
The suggestion is that the protrusion of Pariah /energy/ into Tekumel's plane is blocked/slowed by the Pylons. The prototypes of the Pylons emerged at the same time that the "collapse of Tekumel's system" took place -- that the pylons had the effect of safeguarding the 772 (count?) systems that fell out of o-space from the Pariahs. The theory supposes that the Pariah Deities had been able to penetrate o-space (really bad news) -- and were in the process of devouring the /energy-matter/ in it. The reason for the Pariah "entry" into our space-time is conjectural.  
Perhaps it was the result of unexpected side-effects of the Three-Light Drive -- which weakened the fabric of o-space over time to the point at which the Pariah Deities were able to punch through and begin feasting on the /energy/ of our space-time.  
The Pylons, or should I say the original /quantum-physical/ structures that formed the basis used to construct the Barrier Pylons, was the result of a localized supercooling, fracturing, and warping of space-time in those areas close to which the Pariah beings emerged. The Pylons were/are like knots - created by the immense warping caused by the Pariah presence. These knots closed the holes between Tekumel's pocket dimension and our o-space; sealing Tekumel's system off from the carnage raging elsewhere. These knots have been enhanced over the millennia -- and weakened by various heretical groups seeking to allow the Goddess of the Pale Bone entry to Tekumel's plane.  
Only the most powerful of beings on Tekumel's current Plane really understand the Pylons' structures and purposes. These beings INCLUDE the Mitlanyal (Pavar's 20 Deities).  
The current Barrier Pylons themselves are (Alex conjectures) /devices-structures/ molded from the raw /space-time warping/ of the original "accident". Barrier Pylons thus refers to both the original space-time warping results and the technological-sorcerous "value-added" structures put in place over the millenia. The Barrier Pylons were erected out of that as additional/stronger safeguards against the entry of the Goddess of the Pale Bone into n-space. The Pylons were placed in the strategic conjectures of the /Planar Manifold/ to keep the Pariahs OUT and the beings of the pocket dimensions IN (opening the door on either side would mean an entry point for the Pariahs!). The Barrier Pylons are thus both a /prison/ and /line of defense/ -- molded out of the /quantum-physical/ structure of the universe - but augmented by the sorcerous and meta-technological techniques of person(s) unknown. Just who built these pylons remains a source of mystery -- I have my theory, though. I think the College of Wizards is an excellent candidate for at least some of the Pylon-construction - although they are not nearly the only agents involved.

## E-Space (Exo-Space, Ecto-Space, or Exo-Space-time continuum)

```
-Stephen Foster take’s on Alex’s Concepts, and makes correlations between Tekumél and Dr. Who.
```

Tekumel is in a pocket dimension of E-Space (Exo-Space, Ecto-Space, or Exo-Space-time continuum), which is a smaller universe existing alongside the prime universe, N-Space.  
Locations in E-Space had negative coordinates, where N-Space was positive. So anyone trying to use technology of the Ancients would need to re-work any calculations into the negatives to function in the Tekumel system.  
The Pariah Deities are also called Chronovore’s.  
Silver Suites could be the silver nemesis/ cybermen.
