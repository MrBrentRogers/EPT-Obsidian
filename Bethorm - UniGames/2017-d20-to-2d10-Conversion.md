Pocket Universe Conversion TM

These guidelines show how to convert d20 creatures for use with the Pocket Universe "2d10" game system. Version 1.2, 01/08/2017.  
  
1.0 Size Conversion

d20 Size: 2d10 Size Modifier:

Fine: +4

Diminutive +3

Tiny +2

Small +1  
Medium none

Large -1

Huge -3

Gargantuan -5

Colossal -7

2.0 Attribute Score Conversion

Attribute Name Equivalents  
  
d20 Ability: 2d10 Attribute:

(Str + Con)/2* PHYS

Dex Score DEFT

Int Score** INTL

Wis Score WILL

*round up

**For non-sentient creatures, change INTL to Instinct, INST. Find the 2d10 Attribute Score equivalent, then add 4. For example, a d20 creature with an Int of 2 would convert to a 2d10 creature with an INTL of 6, but if it is non-sentient, then this becomes INST of 10. Instinct is used for alertness, hearing, scent perception, resisting trickery, etc.

3.0 Hit Point Conversion

The creature's new Hit Point total equals the Value of its PHYS score. For example, a 2d10 creature with a 12 PHYS has 17 Hit Points.

4.0 Initiative Conversion

The creature's new Initiative equals the Roll for its DEFT score. For example, a 2d10 creature with a 9 DEFT has an Initiative Roll of 1/1/2.

If the creature has special abilities which add to its Initiative, add up those bonuses,a nd divide by 3 (rounding to the nearest whole number) to find its 2d10 Initiative bonus. Increase its 2d10 Initiative Roll by that many levels. For example,a creature with a special ability which adds 5 to its Initiative receives an increase of +2 levels to its 2d10 Initiative Roll.

5.0 Move Conversion

The creature's new Move score equals its d20 Speed divided by 5. Round to the nearest whole number.

6.0 Armor Conversion

  
Add up the creature's d20 Armor Class modifiers from natural and worn armor, not including shields. Other bonuses that represent damage blocking (as opposed to evasion) also apply. The two numbers for 2d10 Armor represent resistance to Physical and Energy damage. If the creature has resistance or vulnerability to one or the other, adjust accordingly. Convert the total using the table below:

d20 2d10 d20 2d10

Armor: Armor: Armor: Armor:

0 0/0 20 7/5

1-2 1/0 21-22 8/5

3-4 1/0 23 8/6

5-6 2/1 24-25 9/6

7-8 3/2 26 10/6

9-10 4/2 27-28 10/7

11-12 4/3 29-30 11/7  
13-14 5/3 31-33 12/8

15 5/4 34 13/8

16-17 6/4 35-36 13/9

18 7/4 37-38 14/9

19 7/5

7.0 Skill Conversion

Change the names of each of the creature's listed d20 skills to the closest 2d10 equivalent. If more than one of the creature's d20 skills converts to the same 2d10 skill, convert the one with the highest skill bonus and ignore the duplicates. if the creature has d20 skills for which there is no 2d10 equivalent, create a 2d10 version of the d20 skill (selecting DEFT, INTL, or WILL as its base Attribute).

The creature gets a score in each of its 2d10 skills equal to its core in the skill's base Attribute, +1.  
  
If the creature has racial bonuses or other special abilities which add to one of its skills, add up those bonuses and divide by 3 (rounding to the nearest whole number) to find its 2d10 skill bonus. Increase its 2d10 skill score by that many points.

8.0 Dodge Skill Conversion

By default, every creature that is able to move has a 2d10 Dodge Skill equal to its DEFT score +1.

9.0 Shield & Shield Skill Conversion

If the creature's d20 Armor Class mentions a shield, then it carries the closeste 2d10 shield equivalent that it can hold comfortably according to its PHYS score. It also gets a Shield Skill equal to its DEFT score +1. The accuracy modifier and damage inflicted by each weapon varies:

d10 Natural 2d10 Hit 2d10 Damage

Weaponry: Modifier: Level Bonus

arm, crush, +2 none

tail, tentacle,

touch, wing

bite, butt, +1 +1 level

claw, hoof,

rake, slam,

sting

gore, pincer, 0 +2 levels

quills

For weapons that the creature carries, find the closest 2d10 equivalent taht it can wield according to its PHYS score. Heavier weapons can be wielded by creatures who have 2 hands free.

11.0 Defense Conversion

  
2d10 has three numbers for defining defenses: melee, missile, and magic (abbreviated as ME, MI, and MA). Find the creature's best skills for melee and missile defense, and calculate its defenses. For ME and MI, the number should include a bonus from the creature's 2d10 size modifier, as well as from any shield that it is carrying.  

Add up any d20 Armor Class modifiers which represent evasion (as opposed to blocking), not including modifiers from size or Dex. Divide the total by 3 (rounding to the nearest whole number) to find the creature's 2d10 defense bonus. Increase its 2d10 defenses by that many points.  

12.0 Damage Conversion

Figure out the average damage points that the d20 roll would score, and multiply by ten. Then use a calculator to find the square root of that total. Round to the nearest whole number; that is the equivalent average damage in the 2d10 system. For example, a 2d6 damage roll averages 7 points. 7 x 10 = 70. The square root of 70 is 8.3666, so it converts to a 2d10 damage roll of 6/8/10. Here are a few common examples:  
  
d20: 2d10: d20: 2d10:  
d4 3/5/7 d10 5/7/9

d6 4/6/8 d12 6/8/10

d8 5/7/9

  
13.0 Fine Tuning

Look over the converted stats, and think about how it will function in actual play. If necessary, you may add +1 or +2 to one or more of the creature's most crucial skills. If its converted hit points are too low or too high, adjust its hits by +/- 1 or 2 PHYS levels to compensate.  
  
14.0 Converting Other Abilities  
  
Many d20 abilities modify a creature's stats in ways this conversion system already accounts for. Specific conversions of other special abilities fall outside the scope of this document.

The following conversion notes will help you in converting other special abilities:

  
14.1 Appearance

If needed, convert the creature's d20 Cha Score to a 2d10 Appearance Modifier using the table in Section 2.0.  
  
14.2 Saving Throw Conversion

d20 Saving Throw 2d10 Attribute

Fortitude PHYS

Reflex DEFT

Will WILL

  
A creature particularly resistant to magic may have an MA (MAgical Defense) modifier. In the case of a vulnerability, this can be a bonus to being affected.  
  
14.3 Miscellaneous Distances  
  
For ranges, and so on, divide d20 distances in feet by 5 to determine the equivalent distance in 2d10 movement spaces.
