I wanted to send my players to Hmakuyal to find an ancient magical artifact, but I knew
almost nothing about the place, which isn’t described in detail in the published rules. So, I
researched it on the Tekumel list archives and on the Blue Room Archive Search Engine.
These are all the references to Hmakuyal from The Blue Room. They are all from the
Professor himself in response to various questions. Without further ado, Hmakuyal!
## From Message #11:
You might make a pilgrimage to the city of Hmakuyal; there are scholars there with
interests like yours (n.b. Pariah Deities). Ask for a scholar-priest named Deragu hiFershena.
He may be there or in Bey Su. He has ideas about the Pariah Deities that mesh with yours
in some ways.
## From Message #14:
Hmakuyal is easier to reach (n.b. than Sunuz) -- it's a great big volcanic "sink" in
southwestern Tsolyanu, and anybody can show you the way. The ruins are caves built into
the canyon walls. Tourists get within a certain distance and are then stopped. Pilgrims get
farther and are shunted off to perform religious rituals at some of the famous cave-shrines.
Those who are true thinkers are sometimes -- rarely -- invited in for discussions. In your
case, with your interest in heretics and unorthodox thinking, you might want to be a little
cautious.
…
Deragu is a rather elegant man, good physique, late thirties or early forties, thick head of
hair, dark circles under his eyes (giving him an "owl-eyed" look), deep and resonant voice
with strong hints of a "Bey Su" accent. He has one wife and had two children, both of whom
died in a boating accident a few years ago. He is now pursuing a young noblewoman in Bey
Su, but I don't know her name. His interests in Other Planar, historical, and Pariah Deity
matters are legendary.
## From Message #36:
Hmakuyal is situated in a great volcanic "sink: a roundish depression that is deepest on
the western side. The walls of this place have been honeycombed with caverns, passages,
etc., and great images of Lord Ksarul, his Aspects, his mythological exploits, etc. are
carved here and there all around. Travelers come in from the east, enter into a maze of
pilgrimage centres, tombs and graveyards, and fallen temples dating from Engsvanyali
times. Then they go on into ring after ring of caverns, shrines, and the like until they are
deep within the western wall. There are dwelling places there, too, monasteries for priests
(and priestesses), great meeting halls, and other elegant things too numerous to recount.
The city apparently fell into ruin at the end of the Engsvanyali Period and was only partially
restored. It was not Ditlana that is the cause but rather internecine warfare between the
latter-day priesthood of Ksarul and the growing power of the incipient Tlakotani Dynasty.
This is all forgiven now, but many remember. Lord Ksarul's temple has had to be polite to
the Tlakotanis, and indeed, a few Emperors have been followers of the Blue Prince.
…
In brief: the temple of Ksarul believed that its ancient lineages (from Dormoron Plain) gave
it an edge: Dark Moon, Dark Fear, etc. These clans trace themselves back to Lord Ksarul's
bodyguard units (right or wrong). The Red clans of the southwest (Red Sun, Red Sword,
etc.) joined with the Hnalla and Avanthe clans of the central Empire to combat them.
The Tlakotanis have since pushed all this history into semi-secret "closed stacks" in their
libraries. They would like the ancient rivalry forgotten because they want to maintain unity
against the Mu'ugalavyani and other rivals. The fall of Hmakuyal is thus blamed on a variety
of other causes -- including an invasion by minions of the Pariah Deities!
## From Message #85:
The City of Sarku and Hmakuyal are cult headquarters: both very ancient and full of
fanatic worshipers. Sarku's minions hold special pilgrimages and celebrations in his secret
labyrinths every year, and nobody knows what the Inner Temple of Ksarul does deep in the
walls of the crater around Hmakuyal.
Has anybody explored these places? You might try asking Arjai hiVaisoner, who was brought
up at Hmakuyal -- in the outer circle, of course. Various scholars have visited and written
about both of the Tsolyani secret sites, and there was even a fellow who pretended to be
a priest of Ksarul and got into some of the depths under Hmakuyal. He was rather like Sir
Richard Burton, who knew all the right languages, rituals, and details, and managed to get
into -- and out of -- Mecca.) Unfortunately, the fake priest of Ksarul didn't have powerful
enough blocking spells, and the priesthood read his mind, identified him, and then gave him
what he sought: they created an illusion -- for his mind alone -- of a vast labyrinth filled
with magical devices he could never understand, books he could never read, people and
creatures he could never speak with, and endless blank hallways that led nowhere. I think
he's still on display somewhere in one of the outer halls of the temple."
## From Message #366:
As for the number of devices Girigamish made, this is again part of the legend. EPT recounts
the common story told in the Temple of Ksarul. In Gardasiyal, I was more conservative and
listed only the one certain device attested by the Priesthood. Girigamish almost certainly
made more than one -- and perhaps other devices as well -- but only this one can actually
be proved to exist by historical records. You'll find a treatise on it in the Phantasmic Library
of the Indigo Tower in the city of Hmakuyal. Don't expect to check it out for a quick read,
however; it's in one of the treasuries of the Temple of Ksarul there and hasn't been allowed
out for millennia.
## From Message #454:
Hmakuyal is really much better known and populated than Ngala. The priesthood of Ksarul
occupies Hmakuyal, and there are shrines, hostels for pilgrims, and all sorts of Ksaruloriented businesses there (amulet-makers, sellers of religious documents, artists and
sculptors, makers of sacrificial offering statues, and lots of others). The city is a semicircular
volcanic crater, and most of the important shrines are buried in caverns beneath the crater
walls, while the hostels, etc. occupy the centre of the crater floor. Inside one of the oldest
and deepest shrines, it is said, the beast Without a Tail accepts sacrifices and offerings. See
the 'Book of Ebon Bindings'.
Try having the Beast chase a worshipper round and round in one of the labyrinthine tunnels
that surround the central shrine. This is going to surprise a lot of priests there, since their
idea of a good ritual is pretty solemn and dark and rather awesome. They'll be really
shocked and amused to see some poor sacrifice come larruping by, fleeing the Beast!
## From Message #886:
The temple (n.b. to The One Other) you mention was destroyed as part of Trakonel's major
campaign. He saw two many good citizens slipping into servitude to these beings, and he
did his best to stamp out their shrines, ceremonies, power bases, etc. etc. He perceived
their worship as degrading: toadying to deities who in the end would happily eat you! The
temples to the Pariah Deities (mostly to the Goddess, some to the One Other, only a few
to the One Who Is) were not large or elaborate architecturally. Some -- as you will still
find on the Isle of Eyes in the southern seas -- are more like open rings of great monolithic
menhirs, like Stonehenge. Others were part of the underground labyrinths. There is still
a shrine under the City of the Dead outside of Bey Su; cf. the "Adventures on Tekumel"
series. The shrine near Hmakuyal was comparatively larger and better organised than
the others, with local peasants paying tithes of agricultural produce and money, regular
hierarchies of priests/priestesses, and more typical Tsolyani-style bureaucracy. Exactly what
was done there, nobody knows. Emperor Trakonel's senior high general, Tenchai hiVriddi,
refused to enter the innermost shrines himself but had them sealed off. Some say he used
priests of various faiths to fill the labyrinths with several types of poisonous gas first. No
one ever spoke of these shrines again on pain of death, although it is said that at least one
of them is still operating...
