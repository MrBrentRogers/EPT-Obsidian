These messages are the accumulation of the messages that were sent out on 
the Blue Room email list between May 1995 and June 2000.  A large portion 
of the information is directly from Professor M.A.R Barker. When the list 
members joined during the time the list was active, they agreed to refrain 
from sharing this data with non list members.  When the list ended, it was 
urged that the data be made available to non-list Tekumel fans, and it 
seemed like a good idea all around.

I only ask that if you download these digests, or have received them in 
some other way, please respect the agreements the list members made, and 
refrain from passing them around and instead point people to the Tekumel 
web site, www.tekumel.com so that they can download them for themselves, 
and see all the other material available on the Tekumel.com web site.

Many Thanks.

[                   Characters message.                                    ]

Darryl, hello!

I, too, wish there were a basic book on Tsolyani culture. For some years we 
did have the "Sourcebook," but it is out of print, I understand. TOME may 
still have a few copies of vols. I and II; but vol. 3 was never printed. 
Those who need the first two vols. can write or call TOME and see if any 
are left.

The "Sourcebook," however, is not entirely what you want. A simpler, easier, 
and less compendious work would be useful to players. The introductory book 
to the "Adventures on Tekumel" series (the "character roll-up" book) is the 
nearest thing there is now, followed by the solitaire adventures, which give 
lots of background while players are working through the adventures and 
getting themselves killed. Someday, somehow, perhaps we will get a better 
introductory book.

>INMO, you can be swamped by the detail, especially if you play cold (like 
>i did), as not only the world is different,but  the moral, social and 
>political norms _are_ alien. Playing a member of a high clan is also 
>hard, as you have social and political responsibilities which you must 
>honor without becoming a social outcast (or worse).

This is all true. All one can do is -- as with any new culture -- read 
whatever you can find. Play as you see fit, and don't worry too much 
about "correctness" or "authenticity" at first. This comes from experience, 
just as learning to live in a village in India would be utterly alien at 
first and then become familiar, until you finally achieved near-total 
immersion.

>Reading through the EPT rules, the just off the boat is a good concept 
>(and as the Professor said, Rome made a habit of appointing barbarians as 
>generals at al), but here you miss out on what Tekumel offers, rich 
>social and political interaction. (Plus i must add, how would barbarian 
>get to join a decent clan?).

Barbarians can eventually be accepted into the clans -- not Sea Blue or 
GoldenSunburst, perhaps, but good, sensible, respectable clans that will 
use the talents of these new members intelligently. "Outside blood" is 
thus not publicly valued, but privately it is seen as very useful. Most 
of my players did manage to get into clans, some quite high. Public acts 
(serving the Imperium as a military officer, becoming a valued priest or 
scholar, making money in a good business, making lavish gifts to the clan,
marrying one of the clan's offspring, making friends with important 
clansmen, etc. -- all are ways to get yourself into one of these "closed" 
societies.

I am sure our historian colleagues can provide details about the careers 
of late-Roman officials, generals, and even Emperors, who started out at 
the bottom of society and worked their way up.

Good luck.

<Disclaimer: what follows are my private opinions regarding some aspects of
Tekumel. They are not official or canonical pronouncements in any way,
shape, or form.>

Hmm, I'm not so sure about this. If a Chomskian universal grammar does exist
(and I am willing to entertain this notion), embedded in our brain
structure, then finding the "root language" might indeed prove interesting
and informative. Not a root language like Sanscrit or a proto-Sino-tibetan,
but a language mechanism embedded in the neurobiology of the brain. Analysis
of such a "language" might have some interesting side-effects. One might
have an insight into the epistemic and cognitive constraints which seem to
cut across cultures, time periods, and national boundaries. Case in point:
probabilistic reasoning - most natural intuitions about probabiliy that
people have are patently wrong -- ala the Gambler fallacy! Discovery of the
neurological "root language" would shed light on the agent-formation
mechanisms you mention later. One root language
= one biological foundation for ALL thought formation. Now, certainly
cultural "filtration" comes into the picture - and that is when the
interesting discussion begins.

What about the soul of the user? Tekumelani don't even have a concept of the
brain like we do...if published information is accurate. Brain
neurophysiology is not a /science/ practiced on Tekumel - regardless of what
the Tinaliya might say. This is ONLY my opinion, however. Why wouldn't the
languages afect the soul of the user?

On language: I think one has to separate the performative from the
syntactico-grammatical here. Obviously certain languages are more closely
associated with "magic" on Tekumel - Duru'ob, Sunuz, Llyani, etc. But, and
this is a personal opinion, the nature of these languages' attunement to
magic/nexal energy manipulation lies at a much higher level then their
syntax - it is embedded in the practices of their users - the performative
dimension. Nothing makes them special in and of themselves. The sum total of
the theological, scholarly, and literary components of the languages' users
form the base upon which the sorcerous/magical scaffolding is erected. 

Example: The Priesthood of Ksarul "secret language"; the language is a
cipher-based, ideographic system incorporating syntactic markers,
phonological values, and a large repertoire of graphemes (2000+). It is
close, in my limited knowledge, to the Mayan and Egyptian hieroglyphic
systems of writing - which combined graphemes, phonetic signs, and
classifiers/markers into one uniform writing system. The tongue's
specialness comes from the extreme reticence that the Priesthood shows in
teaching the language to anyone - since it is the preferred tongue for the
communication of inner mysteries, secret doctrines, etc. Now, before we rush
of to any rash conclusions about the spooky-juju-tenebrous qualities of the
Ksarul-tongue, keep in mind that the real world correlates of this
mysterious tongue are Old Church Slavonic, Koine Greek (New Testament Greek)
and Latin. All of these languages were strictly controlled, in the sense
that only the elite core of the societies had access to them. Their
specialness came from the exclusivity of their usage by an elite - not from
any depth grammar components. 

What percentage of the Mediaeval population of the Germanic states
spoke/read/wrote Latin? Try about 0.01%. Yet this was the language of
theology, philosophical inquiry (back when natural philosophy was what we
today call science), alchemy, politics, and literature. That's probably
about the same percentage of Tekumelani that know the Tongue of the
Priesthood of Ksarul. Nothing special about the language per se (oops, a
latinism) - except that it use/knowledge/dissemination is tightly
controlled.    

What I think is more worthy of analysis is the emergence of traditions
within the language communities - such Qabbalistic Theology out of Aramaic
and Semitic traditions and, to draw this back to Tekumel, the emergence of
heretical theological traditions out of the cultural, historical, and
litarary traditions of the Khishan and Aom groups.

>I intend to develop this theme along the lines that the secret languages of 
>Duruob, Ai Chi, Sunuz, and the Toungue of the Priest of Ksarul act like a 
>bit of a 'mental virus' and cause ideas and behaviours to take root in the

Question: Why the viral metaphor? All natural languages come with built-in
epistemic and doxastic filters. Terence Parson has recently published a
fascinating (but rather specialist) monograph on the event ontology of
English. As opposed to languages such as Japanese, which are oriented around
verbal constructions ([S]OV languages) (and hence place a stronger stress on
the "successive" and temporal aspect of things), he poses a interesting
analysis of English - and its built-in constraints toward viewing time,
objects, relations. Tsolyani, Bednalljan, Saa Allaqyani would all be "viral"
by your description - they all come with built-in constraints on
viewing/parsing the world - built over a "deep grammar" shared by all of the
languages. Example: the language of politeness in Tsolyani through the
strong definition of social status/role which is embedded in the pronomial
system. Many languages lack this politeness feature (English, for one) or
have it to a much smaller degree (/tu/ /usted/ in Spanish). It seems that
the metaphor is inappropriate - since it fails to touch on the crucial
dimension of the languages - their spoken/written usage in a cultural context.

I am personally very interested in Sunuz, Duru'ob, and Zna'ye as linguistic
vehicles for communication of Pariah Theology. I am troubled by your
suggestion of mind control and inchoate manipulation. Why situate the level
of control of speakers/believers of the Pariah Dieties to the "will" of
these beings at the syntactic level? Or do you mean that the semantic
component of the language(s) is what "sucks people in"? Is the control
effectuated through the the parsing of a temporal event, through the
constraint placed on expressing the temporal event, or is it through the
semantic significance of the event taken in the context of the belief
system? Or all three? Or something else? The viral metaphor says both too
little and too much. What did you mean here?

What is the level that the takeover/infection takes place - morpheme,
lexeme, phoneme, utterance, sentence, dialogue, inference pattern?(Pick your
favorite /-eme/) Doesn't the biological metaphor wear a little thin? Why not
simply suppose that the worshippers of the Pariah Deities are completely and
utterly sincere in their beliefs and that their languages do not incline
them toward anything? Indeterminism, anyone? Instead of being "Zombies from
the Stratosphere" (really mad movie reference) - with their minds controlled
by a remote-control mutogenic depth grammer - couldn't the worshippers be
true believers, complete with a real eschatology, teleology, and mythos. I
think it is important to beware the propaganda of the Engvanyali Pantheon -
with its limited (and limiting - to take a page from your book, Mr. Bailey)
worldview. My point, convoluted though it is, is that all natural languages
are "viral" in Mr. Bailey sense -- so why would that fact be so interesting
in relation to the Pariah langauges?

Also, Ai Che was not solely used as a secret argot - but as a natural
language spoken in the northeast (if memory serves) - and the tones were not
factal compression mechanisms -- at least on my reading. They are minimal
opposition pairs for a supersegmental language. Saa Allaqyani, a modern
descendent of Ai Che, has lost most of its tonal attributes -- without any
necessary loss of "magic" potential by its speakers. Mayan hieroglyphics
were/are not fractal (there is no self-similarity component or a recursive
definition of meaning which can be encoded at all levels (morphemic to
dialogic)) - they were simply formal semiotic (i.e. sign) mechanisms that
relied on the previous knowledge/cultural context of the "reader" to produce
most their meaning. The Mayan hieroglyphics are clearly generative - but not
fractal (if I have any idea of what you mean by that term) - producing
meaning in a historical and social context, but never have a meaning
embedded in them. /Fractal/ is not simply just another word for recursive,
as you well know. Meaning is produced through use of these conventionalised
signs in a specific context.(to take a page from Mr. Wittgenstein).

Answer: No, they probably could not. Think about it! Our speech is a
compression and repetition of sound. Most spoken languages have a very
limited repetoire of phonological sounds - this is to ensure that the
complexity of the transmission mechanism does not overwhelm the
thought/meaning expressed. Whether it's an alphabet, syllabary, or whatever,
the technology of language usage seems geared toward simplifying the
communication protocols used to convey meaning. The recursion and embedding
could not be maintained with any accuracy without enormous performance
constraints (i.e. several weeks to decode a message compressed using a
/fractal compression algorithm/. Believe me, you would never want to do this
decompression in your head -- human beings just don't have the wetware to
cope! If you still don't believe me, sit down with a paper and pencil and
manually compress and then decompress a 24 bit TARGA file by hand using your
favorite /fractal algorithm/. See you in twenty years. 

<aside>
(Oh -- I read "The Embedding" - sorry, that just isn't very plausible!
Training idiot savants to speak to space aliens is one (dubious) thing -
creating a natural language based on those same principles is another.
Discounting the biological constraints in play (read: SHORT TERM MEMORY) -
the actual physiological processing time to actually unbundle anything
significant would make the language totally unsuitable for normal
communication.) 
<end aside>

Of course, since Tekumel is a completely fictitious environment - you can do
anything you please. However, if you are going to throw around those big
words - be sure that you AT LEAST explain them to some minimal degree. There
are very few people (period) who understand these techniques. 

<a plea>
Can we stay clear of the computer science metaphors? They are not
particularily enlightening, and the technical vocabulary of one knowledge
domain does not translate terribly well into another. I would much prefer to
see a discussion of Tekumelani linguistics, demonology, and theology FROM
THE PERSPECTIVE OF A NATIVE SPEAKER/BELIEVER. The "spell-as-computer
program" is already convoluted enough without compounding these discussions
with this obscure technobabble. (What is next -- an article on using chaos
theory to predict weather patterns over Mu'ugalavya - come on!)(I culled
that last bit from a Red Dwarf episode - I know nothing about Chaos Theory
(or weather patterns for that matter)) 

Wouldn't auto-suggestion or hypnosis work as a basis of Pariah "control"
just as well here?  After all, hypnosis is an empirically demonstrated
phenomenon - and is a good deal easier to understand than fractal
compression technology and mutogenic syntax. Why all of this cyberpunk
rubbish? (fractal compression algorithms, ip gates, etc) Does this make the
theoretical basis of the discussion more serious and academic - does use of
words like /fractal/ endow the discussion with "sorcerous/magical" qualities
that it would otherwise not have? I think not.
<end plea>

I am not trying to dissuade anyone from persuing any avenue of research or
discussion, but I am getting concerned that the topics of this discussion
group are starting to run in a dubious direction -- i.e. cyber/techno/crud.
I would love to see and encourage Mr. Bailey's continued work on Duru'ob and
Sunuz (I am working on a grammar of the former, along with Zna'ye myself) -
but I just wish the scope of discussion was more focused around the thought
processes and beliefs of the Tekumelani - and not on our 20th century
scientific dissection of every component of their cultures. Now, several
issues raised by me are themselves suseptable of criticism on similar
grounds -- so I will not repeat them.

First off I'd like to comment on Alex's letter.
Alex, not being a linguist I find 90% of what you say quite 
incomprehensible.  This is quite unfortunate as what I can gleam from your 

[Moderator's Note: Maybe we need to try harder to keep our discussions    ]
[                  from becoming too limited in scope.                    ]

postings seems interesting and insightful, I just wish I could understand 
it.  I find myself re-reading your message over and over, I can alike it to 
the Japanese Emperor (or Tsolyani for that matter) speaking to the masses at 
the end of WWII.  His language was so removed from the common man that they 
couldn't understand him.  Communication is the key word here, give me 
technobabble and 20th C analogies that I can understand than linguistic 
verbosity that just confuses.  Don't think that I don't want to hear your 
views, I do, and that's the point.  No offense intended :-)

And to be fair to David I think that you misunderstood a lot of what he was 
trying to get at.

As for David's points on magical languages.  The way I understand it is that 
the majority of 'sane' people do not understand the motives of pariah 
cultists.  Perhaps if  one knows the language this would give an insight 
into the cults themselves.  In the real world some concepts do not 
translate, the Australian Aboriginals did not understand the concept of land 
ownership when the Europeans came to settle/exploit, it was an alien 
concept.  And boy did they suffer for it.

So following that line of reasoning knowing Sunuz would help you understand 
the mentality of a pariah cultist, this would also have the effect of making 
you susceptible to thinking the same way they do.  Surely this would leave 
you more open to being openly influenced by the various pariah entities and 
their followers.  A RPG analogy would be the Cthulu investigator becoming 
mad after learning too much about certain unmaintainable (umentionable) beings.
Another 
useful reference for you Star Trek fans is a Next Gen episode called Darmok 
(I think).  In this the translator got the words right but they made no 
sense.  Picard had to learn something of the culture before he could 
comprehend the language.  So language is strongly associated with 
ideas/customs/traditions/culture.

[Moderator's Note:  A good example.  An extreme example, but still a good ]
[                   one.  I can't imagine how space flight was developed  ]
[                   speaking that metaphoric language they happened to use]

To summarise, I believe that to properly learn a language one must 
understand something of the people who speak it.  Understanding too much 
about pariah languages could therefore be detrimental to your physical and 
certainly mental health.  If they found out about it they would have to 
convert you or kill you.  I'm sure the temple of Ksarul would have no qualms 
about bumping off an adventurer that learned the secret tongue from a 
learning sphere, he would just know too much.

There are some things that are best left unlearned and unspoken, have you 
ever wondered why the pariah languages are illegal?

Here is a response to Mr. Dermot's Msg63. I am going to limit myself, with a

I hope you enjoy the other 10%. I think you should have no trouble

involved. Hurray! (The crowd goes wild!)

>trying to get at.

That is certainly possible -- although I doubt it. My problems/concerns were
more focused on the conclusions drawn rather than on understanding the
theory. I think I know what he wanted to say - and I disagree with it. Very
simple.


>As for David's points on magical languages.  The way I understand it is that 
>the majority of 'sane' people do not understand the motives of pariah 
>cultists.  

I would suggest that this is an entirely wrong assumption on Mr. Bailey's
part. A large number of these alledgedly /insane/ people were actually
worshippers of the Pariah Deities. IF you will remember, Trakolel I "The
Blazing Light" had to put down a major resurgence of Pariah Deity worship
during his reign (in the early years of the Tsolyani Empire). The entire
south west part of the empire was in danger of conversion to the
/true-Pariah faith/. Use of the term /cultist/ is really not appropriate in
these circumstances -- we were talking of tens of thousands of adherents. If
we did some more research -- say into the religious practices of the people
of the southern continent /Onchash Chaironi/ -  we would probably find
indications of large scale worship of these deities. Sheer numbers does not
equate to /sanity/, I grant you, but it does elevate the phenomenon out of
the ranks of cults. The phenomenon of Pariah Theology should not be
ameliorated to /insane cultists/. By the way - why did you use quotation
marks around sane - are you hedging your bet?

[                   Worship of the Pariah Deities may seem insane today, but]
[                   it may have been a popular insanity.   :)               ]

Please try to draw a distinction between /not having a concept/ and /not
being able to express a concept/. The former is a truism, the latter is a
dubious concept at best. In the case of the Aboriginals, I am quite happy to
entertain the idea that they could in fact understand the concept, once it
was explained, while not accepting the concept as valid, good, rational,
etc. Take the case of Tsolyani attitudes toward democracy - they think it is
rubbish and point to the Miluminayani Nomads as their proof of the idea's
bankruptcy.

How would you reconcile a polygot with this theory? Multiple inclinations?
Again, it is a truism that knowledge of a group's language will help one to
better understand that group. If General Kettukal happens to know Yan
Koryani or Mu'ugalavyani -- does this entail his subtle corruption and
mind-control by Mu'ugalayvani ideas and concepts. No, I don't think so. The
same principle applies to Sunuz, Zna'ye, and Ai Che. It's called
/indeterminism/ -- we are not so blinded by language structures as to be
detrmined by them (physically or mnetally).

Really? How? I specifically asked in my previous posting, the one you had
difficulty reading, just HOW was this influence manifested? Through a set of
inculcated /values/ or /ideas/ that comes with learning the language?
Through a set of /sounds/ produced by speaking the languages? (Burroughs has
a good story called the /Book of Breeething/ that takes this tack.) Through
a set of writing conventions or /graphemes/ which are endowed with a
sorcerous power? Is it good-ol-fashioned hypnosis? That has not been
specified by Mr. Bailey or you.

[                   been released to the general public as of this writing. ]

Just as an aside -- I have been studying the syntax and semantics of Sunuz.
An interesting point about the lexical base of the language is that many
Engsvanyali terms and concepts (particularily those dealing with the Planes
Beyond and magic) appear to be derived from Sunuz. This actually ties in
with my theory that the relationship of heretical religious thought and the
Engsvanyali orthodoxy of Pavar is very close -- the two sides playing off
eachother. The beauty of my theory is that I do not have to incorporate any
ideas about /sanity/ or other prescriptive terms to make a good deal of
Tekumelani history come together. I can postulate that the Pariah Deities
have been a "dark threnody" (to borrow Prof. Barker's apt metaphor) running
beneath the surface of official history, providing much of the sorcerous,
theological, and conceptual basis of Tekumel's official cultures. 

This is combined process of syncretic tendencies (i.e. take what you like
and run with it), conspiracy (various sects and secret societies like the
Bednalljan-era Brethren of Purity and the Order of the Dreamers in Azure),
cross-fertilization of techniques from various traditions (magical
diagrammes, rituals), and wholesale incorporation (i.e. The Horned One of
Secrets, worshipped in the Secret City of Dlash, a Livyani deity, may in
fact be an aspect of the One Other). 

My work on the /Book of the Heresiarchs/ is an attempt to plot these
imbricated threads - to suggest that a good portion of the current theology
and ritual practices (especially sorcerous/demonological/other planar
rites/spells) of the Five Empires is a reworking and incorporation of Pariah
concepts and ideas -- but suitably watered down to sit well with the
religious sensabilities of /noble/ Tekumelani. The Sunuz treatise, the
/Pandect of Those Who Would Journey Beyond/, is replete with magical
diagrammes and techniques which would find their way into the much later
/Book of Ebon Bindings/. The pariah influence is strong - and it does not
require any special linguistically-induced brain rewiring to explain. Let me
provide you with an example, excerpted from some loose translations from the
/Book of the Heresiarchs/.


The infamous Order of the 12th Sphere, founded by the Livyani renegade Dumuz
(Brother of the Faith) Aichan mra Taimuz during the reign of the Queen
Nayari (yep, another Bednalljan society), was notorious for advancing the
idea that ritualistic murder and cannibalism were  prerequisites for the
soul's trancendence from this world and the cycle of rebirth. Their violent
and sexual rituals were the stuff of legend -- and many aspects would later
find their way into the 22nd through 32nd Unspeakable Acts of the Temple of
Dlamelish and Hrihayal - but without the /deep spirituality/ component of
the original rituals. The fact that the Order was only open to homosexuals
is an interesting sidenote - perhaps explaining certain aspects of their
rituals and theology. The murder rampage that they initiated is still the
stuff of folk tales. From their strongholds in the southwest of what is
present-day Tsolyanu, their assassins, the Viewers of the Scintillating
Night, ranged far and wide searching for the right /victims/ to aid in their
rituals and worship. The Order held power for nearly one hundred and fifty
years, until things became impossible for the Bednalljan orthodoxy to
stomach any further. It took nearly twenty years to root out this group --
who had members placed in the highest echelons of Bednalljan society. It is
believed that several of the highest ranking members remained undetected -
and continued their worship and influence on Bednalljan society long after
the cleansing of the original Order. The Order worshipped a deity called
Gai'astha mra Koma'otep /The Goddess of the Night Resplendent/ -- which
modern scholars such as Tsemel Ni'ur hiBurusa believe was an aspect of the
Goddess of the Pale Bone. Now, it is well known that when the Order was
prosecuted and most of its members put to the sword -- the immense library
of the Order was confiscated by the Bednalljan Imperium. The secrets
contained therein were to form the foundation for much of Bednalljan
theology and sorcerous knowledge. The enigmatic /Barrier Pylons/ were first
discussed in a systematic manner by the theologians of the Order of the 12th
Sphere -- and the true nature of their origin and purpose hinted at. Latter
scholars, like the anonymous scribe who penned the /Book of Ebon Bindings/,
would incorporate fragments and bits of this knowledge into their own work.
The beautifully penned and decorated book /Doctrine of the Spheres: A
Cartography of the Planes Beyond/(Bednalljan Title: Daisaku Oshanakarru dhe
Zaimane) , by Javesh Geibaraz, the Order's most important
philosopher-assassins (Bednalljan: /Ka'achaino/ - the highest rank within
the Order),  is still considered mandatory for serious students of the
Planes Beyond. In their complex theology, the 12th Sphere referred the
domain of ultimate trancedence - beyond the wheel of reincarnation, Being,
and Negation. It was the 12th Sphere (the spheres viewed as concentric) that
was the /ultimate destination/(i.e. teleology) of members of the Order -- to
be beyond change and stasis, light and dark, noble and ignoble. The fervour
of this group one can speculate arose out of the intense desire for personal
trancedence - to be free of the manacles of life and repetative being. They
believed worship of Gai'astha mra Koma'otep would provide them with the way
to escape that cycle. /Awaken in Beauty/ was a ritual greeting of the Order
- the beauty of /being/ beyond the cycles of life and death. It is unclear
if any of them achieved their desire. Even more unclear, from our extant
records, was the source of this knowledge/speculation about the Barrier
Pylons. Much of the library was lost beneath ancient Purdanim, portions of
it finding their way into the sealed vaults at Avanthar - placed under
proscription by all Seal Emperors. It is known, however, that the Emperor
Nriqa (The Spider) made heavy use of this forbidden library. What he learned
was lost with him after is mysterious disappearance...    

Is my point clear to you now? If not, respond by private email
(stojanov@ix.netcom.com or alex@pa.dcswins.com), I will elaborate further.

>A RPG analogy would be the Cthulu investigator becoming

I have always found the concept of /sanity/ in Call of Cthulhu an
intellectually barren one. Insanity in that game really means not thinking
like me - where /me/ denotes whatever group you happen to belong to. The
term has basically prescriptive value, rather than any semantic content. If
Mr. Bailey is using the term /sanity/ in this prescriptive sense - well, OK.
I just think that is not terribly insightful. No offense intended, just a
personal observation.

>Another

Star Trek Next Gen - yuk! The Mother of all bad pseudo-science. Maybe the
Pariah Deities are entering Tekumel's Plane through a /directed tacheon
funnel induced by a static warp shell depolarization - what do think
Geordy?/??! Joke.

>To summarise, I believe that to properly learn a language one must

If you reread my previous post you will discover /surprise/ that that is
exactly my point! All of the phenomena that Mr. Bailey enumerates as being
indicative of a language-based corrupution of morals (or whatever he or you
meant by /insanity/) are really effects produced by the doxastic (belief)
system of which the language is a part. It just struck me that Mr. Bailey's
comments took a turn toward the Orwellian Theory of Langauge (remember
Newspeak) - with all of the naivete of that theory. If I was wrong -- and
all he meant to say was that culture+beliefs+language+traditions+behavior
produces effects on the individual -- then I stand corrected. But your point
(and mine) is just a truism of any language and social system. Don't treat
it as such a big deal.

The Temple of Ksarul usually requires very little reason to bump people off
- period. Also, are you suggesting that the Secret Tongue of Temple of
Ksarul is also /viral/?

I'll buy the /physical health/ bit -- getting executed for worshipping the
One Other can really put a crimp in your day (physically)! But inchoate
physical disability from knowing the language? Nah. There is nothing
whatsoever to suggest that. Do you have some examples?

You seem to vacillate between prescriptive uses of terms like /sanity/ and
analytical. Do the languages really mess up peoples' heads? Or just alter
their perceptions in a subtle way? My God, learning ANYTHING /subtly alters
your peceptions/ - there is nothing really important in that insight. So,
which is it? 

/Mental health/! More 20th century pseudo-speak. Are the worshippers of the
Pariah Deities suffering from /low self-esteem/ and are /unactualized/?
Sorry, joke!

>There are some things that are best left unlearned and unspoken, have you 
>ever wondered why the pariah languages are illegal?

Yes, I have. It has to do with the knowledge (read: not the language itself)
contained in the works/rituals/customs produced by the worshippers and
speakers of these languages (not indentical sets). The majority of
informants that we have are, let's be honest, hacks for one or more of the
Great Temples -- with their own agendas and programmes. I choose NOT to go
the way of Call of Cthulhu and treat the Pariah Deities and their
worshippers as merely /insane/, /inscrutable/, /utterly alien/, etc. That
approach really precludes interesting analysis and research. Call of Cthulhu
degenerated into a /don't read that book - you'll go nuts man!/ mentality as
a direct (read: /proximate/) result of that way of thinking. Cthulhu
material went from being fascinating, esoteric lore to being just a boogyman
to scare investigators with. I think that leads to a very one-dimensional
viewpoint of Pariah phenomena, if you or Mr. Bailey take it in that
direction. (Example: /don't read that book, the Doctrine of the Spheres, -
you'll go nuts man)  

Just my two cents, however. It is much more interesting to view them from
the /inside/ - through their books, ideas, languages, and beliefs. The Order
of the 12th Sphere is just a fragmentary example of the sort of research I
am talking about.

Is there anyone else out there who would like to join in the melee? We
should keep this from becoming too specialist. I appreciate your response
(Dermot) let's continue the discussion - but focused on Tekumel.

Alexander Stojanovic

Hmm, I'm not so sure about this. If a Chomskian universal grammar does exist
(and I am willing to entertain this notion), embedded in our brain
structure, then finding the "root language" might indeed prove interesting
and informative. Not a root language like Sanscrit or a proto-Sino-tibetan,
but a language mechanism embedded in the neurobiology of the brain. Analysis
of such a "language" might have some interesting side-effects. One might
have an insight into the epistemic and cognitive constraints which seem to
cut across cultures, time periods, and national boundaries. Case in point:
probabilistic reasoning - most natural intuitions about probability that
people have are patently wrong -- ala the Gambler fallacy! Discovery of the
neurological "root language" would shed light on the agent-formation
mechanisms you mention later. One root language = one biological foundation 
for ALL thought formation. Now, certainly cultural "filtration" comes into 
the picture - and that is when the interesting discussion begins. 

#Apologies to Noam Chomski, of course the neurological mechanism of human

What about the soul of the user? Tekumeliani don't even have a concept of 
the
brain like we do...if published information is accurate. Brain
neurophysiology is not a /science/ practiced on Tekumel - regardless of what
the Tinaliya might say. This is ONLY my opinion, however. Why wouldn't the
languages affect the soul of the user?

#I accept the point about neurophysiology.  (my tiny article on Ahoggya

On language: I think one has to separate the performative from the
syntactico-grammatical here. Obviously certain languages are more closely
associated with "magic" on Tekumel - Duru'ob, Sunuz, Llyani, etc. But, and
this is a personal opinion, the nature of these languages' attunement to
magic/nexal energy manipulation lies at a much higher level then their
syntax - it is embedded in the practices of their users - the performative
dimension. Nothing makes them special in and of themselves. The sum total of
the theological, scholarly, and literary components of the languages' users
form the base upon which the sorcerous/magical scaffolding is erected. 

#I think I have understood it.  In summary - magic is not just a chant, it 
#involves ingredients, behaviour, learning, thinking and posture.  'Magic' 
#languages are just those languages used by people who 'do' magic.  Shame.  
#I thought they were special in, and of, themselves.  I guess our Tekumel's 
#are on slightly different paths.  However, I do agree that magic is not 
#'simple' and that in the game magicians don't pick up magic like cooks pick 
#up a spoon, sorcerers live, learn and die for their art.

Example: The Priesthood of Ksarul "secret language"; the language is a
cipher-based, ideographic system incorporating syntactic markers,
phonological values, and a large repertoire of graphemes (2000+). It is
close, in my limited knowledge, to the Mayan and Egyptian hieroglyphic
systems of writing - which combined graphemes, phonetic signs, and
classifiers/markers into one uniform writing system. The tongue's
specialness comes from the extreme reticence that the Priesthood shows in
teaching the language to anyone - since it is the preferred tongue for the
communication of inner mysteries, secret doctrines, etc. Now, before we rush
of to any rash conclusions about the spooky-juju-tenebrous qualities of the
Ksarul-tongue, keep in mind that the real world correlates of this
mysterious tongue are Old Church Slavonic, Koine Greek (New Testament Greek)
and Latin. All of these languages were strictly controlled, in the sense
that only the elite core of the societies had access to them. Their
specialness came from the exclusivity of their usage by an elite - not from
any depth grammar components. 

#Our player group likes 'spooky-juju-tenebrous' things!
#Kurshetl hiSsanmirin, our resident Ksarul priest (Mark Wilkinson)
#will certainly agree that he is one of an elite, now he may become 
#insufferably arrogant about it, thanks very much.  Oh, yes, did you see the 
#recent National Geographic on the excavated Mayan murals?  Wow!  Great 
#glyphs!

What percentage of the Mediaeval population of the Germanic states
spoke/read/wrote Latin? Try about 0.01%. Yet this was the language of
theology, philosophical inquiry (back when natural philosophy was what we
today call science), alchemy, politics, and literature. That's probably
about the same percentage of Tekumeliani that know the Tongue of the
Priesthood of Ksarul. Nothing special about the language per se (oops, a
latinism) - except that it use/knowledge/dissemination is tightly
controlled.

#OTOH, compare the surge in literacy when the New Testament was published in 
#the common tongue of English.

What I think is more worthy of analysis is the emergence of traditions
within the language communities - such Qabbalistic Theology out of Aramaic
and Semitic traditions and, to draw this back to Tekumel, the emergence of
heretical theological traditions out of the cultural, historical, and
literary traditions of the Khishan and Aom groups.

#I'm completely ignorant of Khishan and Aom.  What are they?

>I intend to develop this theme along the lines that the secret languages of 
>Duruob, Ai Chi, Sunuz, and the Tongue of the Priest of Ksarul act like a

Question: Why the viral metaphor? All natural languages come with built-in
epistemic and doxastic filters. Terence Parson has recently published a
fascinating (but rather specialist) monograph on the event ontology of
English. As opposed to languages such as Japanese, which are oriented around
verbal constructions ([S]OV languages) (and hence place a stronger stress on
the "successive" and temporal aspect of things), he poses a interesting
analysis of English - and its built-in constraints toward viewing time,
objects, relations. Tsolyani, Bednalljan, Saa Allaqyani would all be "viral"
by your description - they all come with built-in constraints on
viewing/parsing the world - built over a "deep grammar" shared by all of the
languages. Example: the language of politeness in Tsolyani through the
strong definition of social status/role which is embedded in the pronomial
system. Many languages lack this politeness feature (English, for one) or
have it to a much smaller degree (/tu/ /usted/ in Spanish). It seems that
the metaphor is inappropriate - since it fails to touch on the crucial
dimension of the languages - their spoken/written usage in a cultural 
context.

#The sorts of ideas that I was trying to imply may be more readily 
#acceptable to pariah language speaker/worshippers  were along the lines of 
#the acceptability of the total destruction of the world and the subsumption 
#of all beings to the pariah gods.  It could be as simple as there not being 
#any concept to express the worth of sentient life in the languages, or it 
#could be as complex as a language pattern that acts like the trigger for a 
#spell.  So, yes, the lack of politeness in some languages is a good analogy.

I am personally very interested in Sunuz, Duru'ob, and Zna'ye as linguistic
vehicles for communication of Pariah Theology. I am troubled by your
suggestion of mind control and inchoate manipulation. Why situate the level
of control of speakers/believers of the Pariah Dieties to the "will" of
these beings at the syntactic level? Or do you mean that the semantic
component of the language(s) is what "sucks people in"?

#I sure hope that I don't have to ask the local OAL to investigate pariah 
#heresy by your characters...  I don't have any pariah worshipping 
#players...yet.  To answer the question, I really meant that the languages 
#'opened' the minds of speakers making them susceptible to magical control. 

Is the control effectuated through the parsing of a temporal event, through 
the constraint placed on expressing the temporal event, or is it through 
the semantic significance of the event taken in the context of the belief 
system? Or all three? Or something else? The viral metaphor says both too 
little and too much. What did you mean here?

# Your expansion is most welcome, and I am very willing to agree that there 
#must be more to it than just the words used.  I quite like the idea of it 
#being triggered by the 'parsing of temporal event' like attending to a 
#ritual.

What is the level that the takeover/infection takes place - morpheme,
lexeme, phoneme, utterance, sentence, dialogue, inference pattern?(Pick your
favorite /-eme/) Doesn't the biological metaphor wear a little thin? Why not
simply suppose that the worshippers of the Pariah Deities are completely and
utterly sincere in their beliefs and that their languages do not incline
them toward anything? 

#What? Pariah worshippers are just like normal people?  Your Tekumel must be 
#different to ours.  Wait a minute!  Are all the source books 'corrupted' by 
#the Engsvanyali belief system?  I sense the need for a paradigm shift in 
#our Tekumel universe.

Indeterminism, anyone? Instead of being "Zombies from
the Stratosphere" (really mad movie reference) - with their minds controlled
by a remote-control mutagenic depth grammar - couldn't the worshippers be
true believers, complete with a real eschatology, teleology, and mythos.

#OK, maybe they only become vehicles for their destructive, rapacious gods

#Tekumel is, to my mind, a profoundly magical place, and this sets it apart

#that will change a few minds!

I think it is important to beware the propaganda of the Engvanyali Pantheon 
-with its limited (and limiting - to take a page from your book, Mr. Bailey)
worldview. My point, convoluted though it is, is that all natural languages
are "viral" in Mr. Bailey sense -- so why would that fact be so interesting
in relation to the Pariah languages?

#Would Pavar have lied?  I thought only Ksarul priests did that.  What would 
#any resident Pariah worshippers like to add?  Are you just like normal 
#folk?  (For another example of propaganda see my posting to the Usegroup on 
#the absence of Stability Demons in Ebon Bindings)

Also, Ai Che was not solely used as a secret argot - but as a natural
language spoken in the northeast (if memory serves) - and the tones were not
fractual compression mechanisms -- at least on my reading. They are minimal
opposition pairs for a supersegmental language. Saa Allaqyani, a modern
descendent of Ai Che, has lost most of its tonal attributes -- without any
necessary loss of "magic" potential by its speakers. Mayan hieroglyphics
were/are not fractal (there is no self-similarity component or a recursive
definition of meaning which can be encoded at all levels (morphemic to
dialogic)) - they were simply formal semiotic (i.e. sign) mechanisms that
relied on the previous knowledge/cultural context of the "reader" to produce
most their meaning. The Mayan hieroglyphics are clearly generative - but not
fractal (if I have any idea of what you mean by that term) - producing
meaning in a historical and social context, but never have a meaning
embedded in them. /Fractal/ is not simply just another word for recursive,
as you well know. Meaning is produced through use of these conventionalised
signs in a specific context.(to take a page from Mr. Wittgenstein).

Answer: No, they probably could not. Think about it! Our speech is a
compression and repetition of sound. Most spoken languages have a very
limited repertoire of phonological sounds - this is to ensure that the
complexity of the transmission mechanism does not overwhelm the
thought/meaning expressed. Whether it's an alphabet, syllabary, or whatever,
the technology of language usage seems geared toward simplifying the
communication protocols used to convey meaning. The recursion and embedding
could not be maintained with any accuracy without enormous performance
constraints (i.e. several weeks to decode a message compressed using a
/fractal compression algorithm/. Believe me, you would never want to do this
decompression in your head -- human beings just don't have the wetware to
cope! If you still don't believe me, sit down with a paper and pencil and
manually compress and then decompress a 24 bit TARGA file by hand using your
favorite /fractal algorithm/. See you in twenty years.

#the references in 'Book of Five Rings'...  Oh, well, maybe demons do it.  
#It was supposed to provoke discussion, and it succeeded wonderfully!

<aside>
(Oh -- I read "The Embedding" - sorry, that just isn't very plausible!
Training idiot savants to speak to space aliens is one (dubious) thing -
creating a natural language based on those same principles is another.
Discounting the biological constraints in play (read: SHORT TERM MEMORY) -
the actual physiological processing time to actually unbundle anything
significant would make the language totally unsuitable for normal
communication.) 
<end aside>

Of course, since Tekumel is a completely fictitious environment - you can do
anything you please.

#Yes, indeed.

However, if you are going to throw around those big
words - be sure that you AT LEAST explain them to some minimal degree. There
are very few people (period) who understand these techniques.

Can we stay clear of the computer science metaphors? They are not
particularly enlightening, and the technical vocabulary of one knowledge
domain does not translate terribly well into another. I would much prefer to
see a discussion of Tekumeliani linguistics, demonology, and theology FROM

Wouldn't auto-suggestion or hypnosis work as a basis of Pariah "control"
just as well here?  After all, hypnosis is an empirically demonstrated
phenomenon - and is a good deal easier to understand than fractal
compression technology and mutagenic syntax. Why all of this cyberpunk
rubbish? (fractal compression algorithms, ip gates, etc) Does this make the
theoretical basis of the discussion more serious and academic - does use of
words like /fractal/ endow the discussion with "sorcerous/magical" qualities
that it would otherwise not have? I think not.

I am not trying to dissuade anyone from persuing any avenue of research or
discussion, but I am getting concerned that the topics of this discussion
group are starting to run in a dubious direction -- i.e. cyber/techno/crud.
I would love to see and encourage Mr. Bailey's continued work on Duru'ob and
Sunuz (I am working on a grammar of the former, along with Zna'ye myself) -
but I just wish the scope of discussion was more focused around the thought
processes and beliefs of the Tekumelani - and not on our 20th century
scientific dissection of every component of their cultures. Now, several
issues raised by me are themselves suseptable of criticism on similar
grounds -- so I will not repeat them.

Moderator's Announcements

Some news for everyone.  Tonight, a new article will be appearing on the
ftp server.  It is the article on the Temple of Ksarul.  How fitting!  I
have someone working on the Temple of Sarku, and am still trying to get the
Splendor of Shenyu set up.

Other notes.  Cmon!  Lets get some other topics of discussion on the list.
I know the tone of the list has been a bit critical, lately, but let's let 
that go.  I want everyone to feel free to participate.  Please.  This list
won't be much unless you contribute.

-----------
In other news, Aidan Dixon, a new list member provides this bit of detail
about the Man of Gold that was published in the UK.

Darryl Adams asked if either of the Professor's novels were published 
in Britain.  The answer is yes.  _The Man of Gold_ was published a 
few years ago by Century Hutchinson.  I can get the ISBN if anyone 
wants, but unfortunately it is out of print now.  It does turn up in 
second-hand bookshops from time to time.  If I see any copies I will 
pick them up and let listmembers know.

>Aidan, Please get the ISBN for the British Publisher's version of MoG.
>I'll add that to my store of info, and let others know, too.

Okay, here are the publishing details: Century Hutchinson, Ltd., 
London, 1985, paperback.  ISBN 0-7126-1051-0.  As I say, it's 
currently out of print, but a booksearch agency might be able to turn 
it up.  Alternatively, for British listmembers, it might be possible 
to obtain it via interlibrary loan.  I seem to recall that there is/was a 
copy held in the LASER London And South Eastern Region fiction 
reserves.  I don't know if it's still there now, though.

As far as I'm aware _Flamesong_ was never published in the UK -- 
I got my copy in the States and I've never seen it anywhere over here.

Aidan.
----------------------
Thanks Aidan!

I do know that MoG and Flamesong are available in St. Louis, if anyone is 
having trouble, let me know, and we can probably find a copy for you here in
the States.

I have only enclosed my theories -- which are speculative and in NO way

On the Barrier Pylons and the Creation of Tekumel's Pocket Dimension:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The Barrier Pylons, which are mentioned in passing in the Book of Ebon
Bindings and in the first Solo Adventures book (College at the End of Time
segment), are quite intriguing -- and I have chosen to incorporate a bit of
their /mystery/ into the Pariah material I am developing. I would love to
get other people's thoughts and theories about them, their origin, purpose,
etc. What I present below is my totally speculative account of the Barrier
Pylons, their origin, and purpose. Needless to say, the scientific coating
of the theory is really weak, so excuse words like /space-time/, /quantum
mechanical/, and /n-space/. It comes across like a Scientific American fever
dream...but I hope it elicits some comment. Please disregard this
scientistic vocabulary if it doesn't suit you. You can easily replace
n-space with /pocket dimension/, quantum mechanical with /constituent/, and
space-time with /dimension/. This might help the readability of the document
slightly. Apologies in advance for the phraseology.

My running theory is that the Barrier Pylons were created as a proximate
result of the fracturing of space-time that resulted in Tekumel's plunge
into the n-space (i.e. pocket dimension) it now inhabits. The net effect is
that these structures protect these collapsed planes from the encroachments
of the Pariah Deities, who have run amock in our "normal" space-time
envelope (henceforth: o-space). Why? The shattered or torn o-space fabric is
not easily traversed by the Pariah Deities due to the dimensional folding
caused by the space-time warping. The barriers act as safety valves between
Tekumel's current dimension (n-space) and the one it came from (o-space).
Given the destruction of o-space by the Pariah Deities, this is a fortunate
thing!

I am suggesting is that the protrusion of Pariah /energy/ into Tekumel's
plane is blocked/slowed by the Pylons. I would further suggest that the
prototypes of the Pylons emerged at the same time that the "collapse of
Tekumel's system" took place -- that the pylons had the effect of
safeguarding the 772 (count?) systems that fell out of o-space from the
Pariahs. The theory supposes that the Pariah Deities had been able to
penetrate o-space (really bad news) -- and were in the process of devouring
the /energy-matter/ in it. The reason for the Pariah "entry" into our
space-time is conjectural. I like to entertain the idea that it was the
result of unexpected side-effects of the Three-Light Drive -- which
weakended the fabric of o-space over time to the point at which the Pariah
Deities were able to punch through and begin feasting on the /energy/ of our
space-time. 

Tekumel's position as a often-visited and important pleasure world (with
many ships arriving and departing continuously) meant it was at one of the
key weak spots on the o-space fabric. When the Pariah Deities emerged itno
o-space -- Tekumel was quite close to some of their point of entry. The
other 700+ systems were also at weakened spots - they suffered the same fate
as Tekumel's system. These were the FORTUNATE ones. The ones that were not
"hurled into a pocket dimension" (n-space) were devoured. When the universe
was fragmented by the entry of the Pariah beings, the net effect (unforseen
even by the Pariah beings themselves) was to create a million+ pocket
dimensions (Tekumel is escounced in one of them) -- all due to the manner in
which the Pariah beings' /null-energy/ interacted with the normal EMR and
gravity of our space-time. According to this theory, there is nothing left
of the o-space we know -- just the dying embers left in the wake of the
Goddess's passage through our space-time continuum. 

The Pylons, or should I say the original /quantum-physical/ structures that
formed the basis used to construct the Barrier Pylons, was the result of a
localized super-cooling, fracturing, and warping of space-time in those
areas close to which the Pariah beings emerged. The Pylons were/are like
knots - created by the immense warping caused by the Pariah presence. These
knots closed the holes between Tekumel's pocket dimension and our o-space;
sealing Tekumel's system off from the carnage raging elsewhere. These knots
have been enhanced over the millenia -- and weakended by varous heretical
groups seeking to allow the Goddess of the Pale Bone entry to Tekumel's plane. 

Only the most powerful of beings on Tekumel's current Plane really
understand their, the Pylons' structures and purposes. These beings INCLUDE
the Mitlanyal (Pavar's Deities). Now, how do I reconcile that with the
Legend of Dormoron Plain....hmmmmm?!!! Could it be that the Ksarul-myth (as
opposed to the Deity worshipped) contains a "hidden" meaning or doctrine -
that the imprisonment of Ksarul is some way mirrors the "imprisonment" of
Tekumel. I shall have to think about this aspect more. 

TO summarize: the universe (o-space), like a mirror dropped on a marble
floor, was shattered by the entry of Pariah /presence (lack a good name)/
into the our /space-time/ manifold. The shards of space-time which were not
immediately devoured by the Goddess of the Pale Bone collapsed into n-space
(multi-dimensional space-time beyond the normal /4/ dimensions we are
familiar with) as a result of the gravitational and electro-magnetic field
disturbances produced by the sudden super-cooling, fracturing,  and warping
of o-space. After devouring our /space-time/ the Pariah's discovered the
inadvertant /mistake/ they had made -- and so began the slow, methodical
search for the remnants of our space-time. 

The current Barrier Pylons themselves are (I conjecture)
/devices-structures/ molded from the raw /space-time warping/ of the
original "accident". Barrier Pylons thus refers to both the original
space-time warping results and the technological-sorcereous "value-added"
structures put in place over the millenia. The Barrier Pylons were erected
out of that as additional/stronger safeguards against the entry of the
Goddess of the Pale Bone into n-space. The Pylons were placed in the
strategic conjuctures of the /Planar Manifold/ to keep the Pariahs OUT and
the beings of the pocket dimensions IN (openning the door on either side
would mean an entry point for the Pariahs!). The Barrier Pylons are thus
both a /prison/ and /line of defense/ -- molded out of the
/quantum-physical/ structure of the universe - but augmented by the
sorcerous and meta-technological techniques of person(s) unknown. Just who
built these pylons remains a source of mystery -- I have my theory, though.
I think the College of Wizards is an excellent candidate for at least some
of the Pylon-construction - although they are not nearly the only agents
involved. 

I like this theory because it fits nicely with the metaphor of the shattered
Egg of the World -- and what that myth/story seems to intimate. In order to
bring Tekumel /back/ to its original position, one would have to reassemble
the pieces of the Egg of the World. Is the Egg of the World a metonymy for
the structure/fabric of the universe? I would like to think so. What the
myth does not address is what is left "back there" (our o-space).  

This is my revision to the Tekumel myth -- I know it may not be yours. The
"tragedy" of the fall into the pocket dimension is actually quite ironic -
it was that "fall" which actually saved Tekumel and the other systems from
the Pariah Deities. This might also explain the Pariah Deities' interest in
Tekumel. (i.e. They are searching for all of the lost systems that escaped
the destruction of our /space-time manifold/!) Following the warped
space-time threads to Tekumel, the Pariahs are eager to get their hands on
the last few bits of /matter-energy/ left. 

Comments, criticisms, and counter-arguments will be appreciated.

May I suggest the use of the term "E-space" instead. Some of you may 
recognise what I'm getting at!

May I also suggest the use of the term "chronovore" instead of Pariah 
Deity, for a similar reason.

If you follow my reasoning so far then you might be able to hazard a 
guess as to who the Silver Suits actually are! (...at least if you're 
British and over 30! Ian Marsh ran an entertaining cross-over scenario 
based on just this premise. FX: biddly-bom biddly-bom BIDDLY-BOM

Seriously, Alex, I would point out the flaw in your theory: How would we 
know of 773 such events if someone hadn't been left behind to count them. 
I like the theory that the Barrier Pylons are somehow associated with the 
T.o.D. event, but maybe they're used to keep Tekumel from returning to 
normal space-time instead?

Thank you Prof Barker for your reply. I apreciate the words about some of 
the questions I had about Tekumel society. 

More on Starting Players

I recently bought the first two books in the Solitaire series. These books 
are great in giving a player a good grasp on Tekumel, but I know I have a 
long way to go (am I the only one getting lost in the language thread?). 
The point is , that new players _will_ get swampeded by the details. 
Maybe we can get together and set up a net newbie book, or a FAQ file. It 
would make my life eaiser :-)

[Moderator's Note:  I do believe a list member maintains a Tekumel FAQ.    ]
[                   It may not answer all your questions.  It may not even ]
[                   cover Tekumel Source material, just point you to sour- ]
[                   ces of Tekumel info.  Maybe the keeper of the FAQ can  ]
[                   let us know what it covers.  How about it, Brett?      ]

Novels.

Thanks for the details on the first Tekumel book. Will see if I can get a 
copy here. Unfortunately due to the vagrencies of Australian Copywrite 
laws, if a book is published in England, the American version can no 
longer be imported. So it may mean that the second book will not be 
available in Aus. So if anyone over in the US can get spare copies of 
either books, please let me know.

Language.

While I don't want to get involved in the language thread, I wish to point 
people to read Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash, where the language as 
programming idea is expressed. I personally believe, however, that since 
many Role Players are not Linguists or Biologists, that if an idea works,
run with it and b*gger the scientific justification.

I have queries about the dread inimical species -- Hluss, Ssu,  
Shunned Ones, etc.

Professor Barker states:
>It is not possible to talk to these races about "gods" or "magic"  
>because communication is impossible, lacking, or always refused. As  
>far as I know, there have been NO exceptions.
	Okay. It's clear that the inimicals have no interest in  
humanity besides the rather basic one of "How do we exterminate  
them?", but this is not the same as to say that there is a complete  
absence of communication.
	I seem to recall a group of humans being kept as  
prisoner/pets by the Black Ssu in an officially sanctioned campaign  
(sorry, can't quote chapter and verse on this). In addition, the  
Hluss have human contacts through which they vend Zu'ur to our  
species. In addition, there are the so-called "neutral races", who  
have contact with the hostiles, and also with humanity -- can  
nothing be learned through an intermediary.
	It strikes me that a clever researcher could somehow manage  
to contact one of the non-human races via a number of potentially  
efficacious (admittedly dangerous) techniques. I propose that  
someone attempt one of the following three methods and report back  
to the Blue Room Mailing List at once as to the results, if he  
survives:
	1) use magic to transform oneself into the physical  
appearance of a neutral species (one not hostile to the Ssu) and  
contact them in the form of a merchant or other individual whom it  
is unlikely they'd slay at once.
	2) infiltrate the Zu'ur drug culture and make one's way  
high enough up the ladder to actually receive deliveries from the  
Hluss. Go and meet them.

[Moderator's Note:  One of the solo adventures sheds some light on this.    ]

[                   word or two to say on this.                             ]
[                   In any case there is not some meeting between the human ]
[                   and Hluss (they provide the Zu'ur).  If I remember cor- ]
[                   rectly, the people receiving the shipment pile a bunch  ]
[                   of stuff on the shore, the hluss ride up on one of their]
[                   hive ships, take the goods, drop the zu'ur and skee-    ]
[                   daddle.  Now, I am not privy to how they set up this    ]
[                   system of barter, nor how they set the prices...  But I ]
[                   am not sure that anyone does.  Professor....            ]

	3) raid the Hlutrgu swamps and bring back some of their  
tadpoles (or whatever the hell their young 'uns look like). Raise  
them in big tanks with only humans as companions. I'm sure they'll  
still be mean and nasty, but perhaps they can learn the human  
tongue, and be studied. I doubt this would work with baby Ssu or  
Hluss grubs, but the Hlutrgu at least seem to be vertebrates.

>It is suggested that the Chlen must be genetically-engineered,  
>because their hide can be used to make stuff almost as hard as  
>bronze.
	Note that cuirbouilli, ordinary leather boiled in wax, can  
be used to make a pretty damn hard substance. Maybe not suitable for  
weapons, but it sure worked for armor.

Professor Barker (no biologist he) wonders
>Is it not equally possible that the Chlen were just a lucky find:  
>an animal that possessed this unique quality?
	Biological organisms on earth produce a number of  
substances that are as tough as or harder than bronze. Or steel, for  
that matter. A tungsten steel hip joint doesn't last as long nor  
can it stand the strain of a plain ordinary bone one. Don't be  
fooled by the simplicity of snapping a dried or cooked bone. A fresh  
bone is mighty sturdy. I read an FBI report once that indicated a  
common event during hammer assaults is the breaking of the _hammer_  
on the victim's skull! Cheap modern tools, I suppose
	Spider silk is _much_ stronger than steel, and it is  
produced as a liquid that hardens into a polymer upon exposure to  
air! The only problem with using spider silk as super-kevlar armor  
is that the damn things are cannibalistic so they can't really be  
conveniently domesticated.
	I see no reason that the Chlen may not have naturally  
evolved to produce some sort of potent chitin-like substance. There  
is no need to postulate genetic engineering. Even if we decide that  
human intervention has taken place to increase the amount of armor  
produced by Chlen, it need not be "engineering". Ordinary selective  
breeding can do the trick. Consider the difference between a shih  
tzu and a greyhound to see the amount of variation that good old  
ordinary breeding can produce. Given the amount of time the folks of  
Tekumel have had to breed stuff, it would have been possible (note:

	Don't sweat the chemistry, prof. This would be organic  
chemistry of an alien world -- i.e., exceedingly bizarre and filled

	Human beings compress speech all the time, and _much_ more  
successfully than computers. A human being talking, gesticulating,  
and making facial expressions delivers on the order of megabytes of  
information each second.
	Sample human info compression: Your friend turns to you and  
says, "Have you seen that movie? You know, with the guy." More  
often than not, instead of saying, "Huh?", you know what he's  
talking about. Of course, an outsider watching would be utterly  
confused.

There have probably been both attempts and also minor successes. The way 
things on Tekumel are NOW, it would be next to impossible to communicate. 
Both sides mutually hate one another, and frames of reference, linguistic 
structures, thought processes, etc. etc. are all too alien to get much 
across. Part of this is a decision made for "game purposes," too: I was 
forever having arrogant young players coming up and telling me about their 
personal "pet" Ssu, or a Hluss who just wanted to be totally loyal to a 
player character. This struck me as a cop-out -- and also something so 
unlikely that it seemed best just to forbid it entirely and let the 
"reasons" fall where they may...

>I seem to recall a group of humans being kept as  
>prisoner/pets by the Black Ssu in an officially sanctioned campaign  
>(sorry, can't quote chapter and verse on this).

Yes, there was a brief adventure of this nature. The prisoners were being 
kept for delightful torture and speedy execution, however. They managed to 
escape, and we never did that again. The Black Ssu are, after all, the most 
sophisticated and flexible species of hostiles. The Hluss, the Grey Ssu, 
and the Shunned Ones were just too set in their ways. 

>In addition, the  Hluss have human contacts through which they vend Zu'ur 
>to our species.

Yes, through non-contact barter. You leave what you want to barter; I 
leave what I want to trade for it. We strike a deal with neither of us 
ever having to come face to face with the other. It's worked in this 
world -- why not Tekumel?

>In addition, there are the so-called "neutral races", who  
>have contact with the hostiles, and also with humanity -- can  
>nothing be learned through an intermediary.

My feeling is that these races themselves are too alien to the human 
way of thinking to WANT to help humans communicate with the inimicals. 
I know it is hard for Americans/Europeans to understand, but not every 
people, race, culture, or what-have-you shares the "scientific" attitude 
that is needed for experimentation and study. Try explaining some of the 
"simple" products of our own culture to those who have never grown up in 
that tradition. It's not as easy as it seems. I recall once trying to 
explain to a group of tribesmen in central India what a two-dimensional 
picture in a magazine was supposed to show. Having never seen magazines 
or pictures before, my friends had a hard time "seeing" depth in the 
picture. Then try expalining how you get a metal airplane stuffed full of 
human beings to rise off the ground and fly from Calcutta up to Delhi!

Various spells would work, of course, to make one look like a neutral 
species. The problem is then smell, "feel," and other imponderables. 
I doubt whether this method would work long enough to find out anything 
much of value. The consequences might then also be fatal...

The drug-buyers never actually meet the Hluss. Nobody knows who set this 
business up in the first place, but it may have been one of the neutral 
species -- at human instigation. Anyone "going to meet the Hluss" deserves 
what he/she gets. The barter is strictly non-contact.

You are correct. The "prices" are what the two sides will agree on: you 
leave your stuff, and I leave a pile of things to trade. You don't want 
to wreck the bargain, so you carefully take enough to satisfy you but not 
so much as to appear too greedy. I do the same. If either of us gets too 
grabby, the system breaks down.

Try bringing up a pit viper or cobra baby. The Hlutrgu are more 
intelligent, to be sure, but they act on instinctive levels and 
don't seem disposed to reason.

You're welcome to try these methods. I do not allow them in my campaigns, 
partially because it makes my life difficult as a referee, partially because 
I do not believe that communication is really possible, and partially 
because I am sure it has all been tried before -- with sad results -- 
somewhere over the many millennia. In any case, the Tekumelani lack the 
American/European "scientific attitude" needed to THINK of these methods, 
or to implement them if they do. 

Your remarks on Chlen-hide are well taken. Thanks for the insight.

I agree. I keep wondering about "genetic engineering." I suspect the 
Chlen are natural, probably from the Pe Choi worlds somewhere.

I haven't ANY idea of what a "fractal algorithm" is. I leave this to 
the experts amongst us. Your example is very clear and reasonable, 
however.

I tend to "see" Tekumel, not "reason" it. My abilities to think in 
abstracts are VERY limited, but give me something I can describe in 
colour, smell, feel, etc. terms, and I can do it. I have no idea what 
sorts of plants exist on Tekumel, for example, but if you ask me to step 
out into a Tekumelani garden and DESCRIBE some, I can do it -- and leave 
the biology to some budding (pun!!) scientist to work out. I "see" cities, 
peoples, buildings, social institutions, etc. Knock on the door of any 
house in the Five Empires, and I can tell you who lives there, what the 
family is like, what clan and social level the household belongs to, their 
religious and social affiliations -- and all that. I can SEE this without 
thinking about it. It will be the same if I ever pass that way again. How 
I do this I don't know -- I can't remember my own name on this world.

Thanks for the various insights.

Communication with Inimicals

>forever having arrogant young players coming up and telling me about 
>their personal "pet" Ssu, or a Hluss who just wanted to be totally 
>loyal to a player character.

	Hey, I don't object to the inimical races being wholly  
inimical. You have to remember that I get plagued by folks who  
explain to me how their character has a pet shoggoth or whatever  
from my Call of Cthulhu game, and I'm forced just to smile and say,  
"how nice for you."
	Note: my theories on communication with the inimical races  
in no way is intended to imply that one can become "friendly" with  
them in any way. My point is that it might make a fun series of  
adventures for a band of Thumis-oriented PCs to try to do this "for  
knowledge's sake". I think it would be incredibly hard, maybe even  
impossible. But fun to try.

>>the Hluss have human contacts through which they vend Zu'ur

	Ah. I did not realize it was done through non-contact  
barter. Makes perfect sense.

>I know it is hard for Americans/Europeans to understand, but not  
>every people, race, culture, or what-have-you shares the  
>"scientific" attitude that is needed for experimentation and study.  

	Yes yes yes I know, but the folk of Tekumel _do_ have  
entire religions devoted to the pursuit of knowledge, and while they  
are doubtless oriented towards classification and philosophizing  
rather than experimentation this is not necessarily a handicap.
	While it is certainly true that modern Westerners lack  
certain cultural "blinders" that seem (to us) to be placed upon  
those from other cultures, I find that most Westerners cannot even  
detect our own cultural peculiarities which are just as powerful and  
restrictive, but which seem "natural" to us.
	For example: Americans are unnerved by a silent person. If  
an American is sitting in a room with someone, and that other person  
doesn't speak for a while, the American is virtually forced to  
blurt out some comment, even if the other person is reading or  
whatever (or the American is). It usually only takes 10-15 seconds  
for this to work. Navajo friends of mine (I was raised in Utah) were  
quite amused by it, since Navajos normally _expect_ long silences  
during their conversations. English friends of mine have remarked  
that Americans seem very pushy to me, because the English, too, are  
evidently able to sit happily and quietly.
	I _am_ American, and on trips to England in which I _knew_  
about this particular cultural foible of Americans, I still was  
unable to prevent myself from making some inane statement when  
"trapped" with some quietly content Brit. *sigh*
	Americans have other interesting features, too. Our doors  
are relatively shoddy, compared to German doors (which always shut  
with a *snick* -- show me a U.S. hollow core door that'll do _that_  
every time), and non-soundproof. But, on the other hand, our doors  
are usually wide open. In fact, closing one's door is a clear  
indication of desire to be alone, if not outright antisocial  
grumpiness. But Germans don't consider doors to be symbolic of one's  
own openness or friendliness. Closing a door is the norm -- what  
else is the door for? But Yanks think Germans are standoffish,  
because they don't use doors in the logically indefensible manner of  
our own folk.
	I use these examples just to show that cultural bias isn't  
restricted to peculiar Tsolyanu folk. We must shed our own blinders  
before we can don a Tekumel mindset -- but we must also recognize  
that the Tekumel point of view is not just a subset of our own. It  
has advantages as well as disadvantages.

	Hey, if at first you don't succeed, try, try again. I  
didn't think that turning into an inimical would work -- they'd see  
right through you.

	Ah, but you can communicate by means other than  
face-to-face speech. Obviously by penetrating the Zu'ur dealers you  
could (a) find out how prices etc. are set, and (b) maybe  
communicate something else, before you are exposed by your  
co-workers, trussed up like a mummy, and left with the other payment  
for the next Hluss delivery.

NON-CONTACT BARTER
	In the good old days, the Vikings performed this with  
Russian villages. Here is how they were able to set prices and  
_everything_ without ever talking to the scary outsiders. I assume  
the Hluss did something similar at the start.
	First, the Vikings sail up to the town. The townsfolk run  
off into the forest. The Vikings then unload a bunch of goods on the  
riverside, then sail back across the river. The townsfolk scuttle  
back to the shore, check over the Viking goodies, then pile up a  
batch of their own trinkets and gewgaws next to the Viking pile.
	Now the Vikings sail back across, while the townsfolk make  
themselves scarce once more. If the Vikings think the townsfolk left  
enough stuff, they take it and sail off, leaving their own goods  
behind. If they think the townsfolk were too chincy, they don't take  
it, but sail back across the river again, and the townsfolk must  
come out and pile more stuff on their heap. The procedure is  
repeated until both townsfolk and Vikings are happy.
	Another technique sometimes used is, when first visiting a  
village, a wide variety of trade goods are displayed. The townsfolk  
then select out those goods they like the most.
	This trade technique is highly useful in Tekumel -- not  
just for Zu'ur dealers, but any time PCs need to trade with peculiar  
folk. (i.e., most of the time, if they're out exploring).

	Hey, pit vipers and cobras are raised to adulthood all the  
time. Admittedly, it's not a trivial task. But what a keen scenario  
hook for a band of PCs! Two ideas spring to mind at once:
	1) the Thumis temple wants to try this out, so the PCs are  
the spearhead of the temple's attempt to find and capture the  
spawning vats of a Hlutrgu tribe. Good luck on this heavy combat  
option. Once you capture the spawning vats, your troubles have only  
begun -- now you gotta get them back to civilization through the  
trackless swamp. And of course, if the authorities catch you trying  
to bring Hlutrgu sprats into town, it's sharpened stakes all-round!
	2) A gray-haired elder has secretly raised a Hlutrgu to  
adulthood. He's taught it several vocalizations, including, "Food",  
"Hate", "Fluffy" (the name the priest bestowed on it), and "Kill".   
(Despite the priest's best efforts, it didn't seem disposed to learn  
such words as "Daddy" or "Home".) It's pretty vile, but admittedly  
not as deadly as the real thing (maybe only because it hasn't had a  
chance to learn from older, wiser Hlutrgu). But poor little Fluffy  
has run off, and is hiding in the sewers. Please fetch back my pet.

	Like I said, if it was a whole scenario or campaign, this  
objection would depart.

	Well, this may be so, but wouldn't eliminate the fun of trying.

	Of course it has. But when's the last time your PCs only  
came up with new ideas never tried before?

What the Professor describes is rather terrifying to see in action.  
Those of us lucky enough to have gamed with Phil for the past few 
years have seen it all too often.

The story I like to relate involves a "servant" that Arjai hiVaisoner 
had with him on a ship, by name of Kagor.  Kagor and Arjai parted ways 
after disembarking.  Three years of Earth- and Tekumel-time later 
Arjai was unfortunate enough to be in Meku when the Governor of that 
city, known as the "Disposer", decided he'd had enough of the Dark 
Trinity temples (this was 2364, after the coup by Dhichune) and 
sent in his troops.

In the confusion, Arjai made his way back to his clanhouse, Cloak of 
Azure Gems.  Phil [MN: Professor Barker] said, "In the courtyard you 
see a little old man, balding, somewhat stooped."

While that description could apply to anyone from Gamalu to Fu Shi'i, 
I just *knew* that it was Kagor.  And it was.  And when I asked him 
how and where he'd been, he told me.  All completely reasonable, 
understandable, and consistent with events which had been taking place 
during the intervening time period, which had resulted in his being in 
Meku at the same time as Arjai by entirely different paths.

Those who know me know I'm a skeptic and cynic of the first order.  
However, I have to admit I've seen things in my life I can't 
understand.  For instance, a woman once demonstrated to me how she 
used dowsing rods (divining-rods) to map out archaeological sites 
before digging.  It can't work, but it does, and I held them in my 
own hands and watched it happen.  Gaming at with the Professor can be 
like that too.  It kinda gives ya the willies when it happens.

[Moderator's Note:  Professor Barker continues on Sandy's respones.         ]

Sandy: Hi!

Attempts at communication with the hostile races have indeed been tried 
over the years, and some have had interesting results. I misinterpreted 
your statement to mean that the adventure would end in SUCCESS, and the 
player party would manage to communicate with the hostiles. But it would 
be sort of like the American Medical Association giving a proctological 
exam to Godzilla! Not very likely...! But fun? Yes, I agree that there 
might be some interest in this adventure.

Somebody once found the island in the outer oceans where Grey Ssu, Black 
Ssu,  and humankind all dwell side by side. The humans and the Ssu could 
only manage a few simple vocables of each other's languages, but they 
shared certain tasks and avoided bothering each other. As I recall, these 
particular groups had been isolated since before the Time of Darkness and 
had never learned to hate each other. But this was only a gaming experiment, 
and nobody ever wanted to continue it or to bring these "friendly Ssu" back 
to Tsolyanu. The good, normal, civiised citizens of the Five empires would 
have been horrified and made short work of such emissaries of cultural 
diversity!

You are quite correct about American / European cultural blinders. We have 
them, just as other peoples do. We can't see ours, but we can see -- and 
make fun of - - those of other societies. The "silence" example you give is 
an excellent one. Another is our American (and somewhat different European) 
sense of humour. We American males make fun of each other, using jibes and 
sarcasm to embellish our conversations and establish bonds. When I did this 
with Indian and Pakistani friends, I got myself into lots of trouble! They 
have a wonderful sense of humour, too, but the manifestations and the 
"buttons they push" were VERY different. I have now learned to behave quite 
differently in their society. This is exaggerated when I deal with non-
Westerners who have less exposure to American / European norms. Try kidding 
a Baluchi tribesman about his wife, and he'll hand you your head! 

>	Hey, if at first you don't succeed, try, try again. I

>right through you.

Try again? You'll get a revolt by Tekumelani characters who do NOT want 
a player taking them out on such foolhardy expeditions! The peoples of 
Tekumel have enough trouble with players who want to take them down into 
ancient ruins and buried tombs and get them killed -- ! But disguise 
yourself as a Ssu and try impressing them with your conviviality and 
sweetness?

Yes, you might find out prices and how and where the barter takes place. 
Good adventure! All of the governments of the Five Empires tke a dim 
view of Zu'ur dealers, however, and with a little bad luck, you'd end 
up sliding down onto the impaling stake yourself. Could be worked up 
as an adventure module, though.

Okay! The priest hires the player party to find "Fluffy" and bring 
him (it?) home. Fluffy, however, has other ideas. He heads for the 
river, then to the swamps. The player party spends days squeliching 
around in the muck, is eaten by Ghar or other nasties, and disturbs 
the fearsome River Akho in its nest...

Not that I have ever written in detail. The Bestiary and the Sourcebook 
may contain a note or two. THis, too, is a project whose time may yet 
come... Too much to do, and not enough lifetime left to do it all.

Some great fun ideas here. My players will not thank you for providing 
me with delightful new scenarios.

Maybe a little trip into Ssuyal to find the composer of "Ssu City Ssu"??

[Moderator's Note:  David (I've forgotten his last name and he is coming in  ]
[                   via someone elses account) provides his 2 cents on the   ]
[                   Pariah Hereseology topic.   Sorry David!  :(             ]

The Ultimate Secret of Tekumel
This posting to the Blue Room is in reply to the "Pariah Heresiology" by
Alexander Stojanovic and others. The following may perhaps clear up some of
the debate over the relationship between the pariah deities and the
Pantheon of Pavar.
     It seems appropriate in any discussion of Tekumelani theology,
especially when ex-ploring such recondite topics as the natures of the
gods, the pariah deities, and others, to recall what Pavar himself said
about them. They are "elusive, slippery, cool and distant from our ken.
They are the Gods."  Pavar, a humble priest from some remote backwater on
Ganga, seems especially susceptible to just the kind of heavy-handed
mystification and dogmatization which cuts short speculation and safeguards
position and privilege. But he is also speaking the truth: the gods are
ultimately unknowable. Pavar recognized that his pantheon employs a "cookie
cutter" approach, but this is what the great interdimensional beings
themselves instructed him to do -- gentle Thumis, shining Hnalla, the
others of the Lords of Stability, the Cohorts -- they knew what they
wanted. They got it.
     But what did they get? A religious reformation occurred, leading to
the Concordat, which established the Lords of Stability on the one hand and
the Lords of Change on the other.  Each side in eternal conflict with the
other.  Each side having enemies with which to chasten and subdue its
adherents, and the adherents of the opposing side.  Sound familiar?  The
earthly analogue is, of course, the Cold War between the United States and
the Soviet Union in the half-century following World War II. The war is
presented to the people of BOTH countries as one of freedom vs
totalitarianism, right vs wrong, East vs West, etc... while the real war
was between the powerful in BOTH countries vs the powerless in ALL
countries (primarily the countries in their respective spheres of influence
but also, to a very great degree, in the United States and the Soviet Union
themselves).  The Cold War was a relatively stable bipolar mode of global
management which made a few people rich beyond their wildest dreams, and a
great many people miserable beyond the most horrific nightmares imaginable
-- or dead.
     Now apply the analogy back to Tekumel.
     The Lords of Stability and the Lords of Change are NOT eternal enemies
but rather are participating in a form of global -- or multiplanar --
management. This is supported by four main sets of facts: 1) each god's
Aspect system accomodates a variety of human personality types (the reason
certain Avanthe worshippers are more bloodthirsty than the average
Vimuhla worshipper); 2) within Pavar's Pantheon there are complicated
relationships (such as the antipathy between Vimuhla and Sarku, or
cooperation across the divide of Stability vs Change); 3) the amalgamations
of Pavar's deities in other lands (the Shadow Gods, Hrsh, Shiringgayi,
etc.); 4) the existence of demons, the pariah deities, and Ksarul as an
outlier. To what end this collaborative effort at multiplanar management?!?
As in the Cold War, to protect the status quo, to keep the Tekumel
multiverse in its present series of dimensions. Who then is the real enemy
and what are its objectives? The pariah deities who want either to
eliminate every atom of every molecule in each of the multiverse's infinite
planes (the Goddess of the Pale Bone), or to return Tekumel back to the
universe of humanspace (the One Other). But why did not Pavar organize
religion around THIS conflict: the ten good gods, or the five gods having
both dark and light faces, vs the pariahs (the Goddess of the Pale Bone,
the One Other, the One Who Is, the One of Fears, the Mad One of Hl'kku) --
five gods seeking to preserve Tekumel's multiverse vs five gods attempting
to destroy it. Because it was just this religious insight and formulation
which the gods of Pavar's Pantheon had desperately sought to prevent by
setting up the false dichotomy between Stability and Change. The
religious revolution which began with Pavar, which led to Engsvanyalu and
all subsequent history, which has led to Tsolyanu's -- the Five Empires',
the Many Worlds' -- present crisis, was, in actual fact, a
counter-revolution whose side effects are once again spiralling out of
control. As in the Cold War, where counter-revolutions generally sought to
destroy independent development outside models approved by and in service
to either the United States or the Soviet Union, the gods of Tekumel, in
completely proscribing the pariah deities, seek to prevent people from
learning about them even as enemies. Why? PERHAPS THEY ARE NOT ENEMIES.
Perhaps the so-called pariah deities are really the good guys and it is the
gods of Pavar's Pantheon who are really the vampiric destroyers (after all,
how many millions have been sucked dry throughout the tens upon tens of
thousands of years following the Time of Darkness without one hint of
progress -- the infamous Tekumelani inferiority complex!?!).
     How is this for heresy?

[Moderator's Note:  David postulates some more on Pariah Hereseology and   ]
[                   Ksarul.                                                ]

Some Reflections Upon Ksarul

The pantheon of Pavar is characterized by balance and symmetry: the five
Tlomitlanyal, each attended by his/her respective Hlimekluyal, standing in
eternal opposition to the five Tlokiriqaluyal and their attendant
Hlimekluyal. Rulership, Wisdom, War, Feminine Concerns, and the Afterlife
are all arranged in two opposing ranks, one striving for Stability, Light,
Peace, etc. while the other strives for Change, Darkness, Violence, and
Selfishness. The gods are immanent and active in the world of men; myth,
legend, and history describe the appearances of gods, demons, and lesser
creatures fighting on one side or the other. Much of the intrigue
surrounding the succession of Tsolyani emperors has to do with whether
Stability or Change will control the Petal Throne and Avanthar itself. The
struggle is perpetually "see-saw" in character: of the sixty-two Tsolyani
emperors, roughly half worshipped one of the Tlomitlanyal, and half one of
the Tlokiriqaluyal. Again, the reigning characteristics are balance and
symmetry.
     But is this truly so?
     Close inspection soon reveals that the situation is more complex than
ten gods of light forever fighting ten gods of darkness. Within the ranks
of the Tlomitlanyal, for example, Hnalla, Thumis, and Belkhanu are closer
to one another than they are to either Avanthe or Karakan. The latter two
often bitterly oppose the pacifism of the "gentle" three. Even so, Thumis
is one of the most mythologically active deities in the pantheon. Karakan's
concern with warfare often forces his alignment with Vimuhla, his
counterpart among the Tlokiriqaluyal; and the same goes for Avanthe, she
often sides with Dlamelish over feminine issues. Vimuhla and Dlamelish also
have sharp  antipathies toward Sarku, the god of the undead. Sarku aligns
most closely with Hru'u and Ksarul, but even this isn't that solid an
alliance -- neither cold and devious Hru'u nor secretive Ksarul seem to
like Sarku much (and yet the three make up the so-called "Dark Trinity").
But then, no one likes Sarku much. Just take a look at a pair of Kevuk
dice: Vimuhla is opposed not by Karakan, as one would expect, but rather by
Sarku.
      Consider...

      Next consider the existence of the Shadow Gods, Hrsh, The Mad One of
Hlikku, Shiringgayi, etc. Taluvaz Arrio of Livyanu believes these to be
different gods, not amalgamations of Pavar's deities as many Tsolyani
scholars attest.
      Consider further the existence of the Pariah deities, such as the One
Other and the Goddess of the Pale Bone. These beings exist, but were
ignored in Pavar's codification of religious life some sixteen thousand
years ago. Things are considerably more complicated than appears at first
sight. This is obvious.
      Lastly, consider Ksarul. Supposedly, he is the member of the
Tlokiriqaluyal who stands in direct opposition to Thumis. Ksarul represents
wisdom for the sake of selfish power-seeking, whereas Thumis represents
wisdom for the sake of societal advance. The problem is that the two are
neither balanced nor symmetrical. Ksarul is not only more powerful than
Thumis, he is more powerful than all the other gods combined, or he would
be were he not their prisoner within the Blue Room. Numerous epics across
the Five Empires tell the story of the Gods War, in which Ksarul challenged
not only the Tlomitlanyal but the Tlokiriqaluyal as well. He was defeated
at the Battle of Dormoron Plain but is fated to rise once again. His defeat
was accomplished only with the assistance of the One Other, a pariah deity
otherwise anathema to the gods of Pavar's pantheon. Ksarul's minions were
driven forth from this universe, and their "young", "brilliant", and
"ambitious" Lord was brought low -- brought only then into a position of
balance and symmetry within the pantheon.
      The "Lament to the Wheel of Black", the "Song of the Reaper of
Sighs", the "Hymn of Nga-Inverge" -- these are the Iliad, Oddyssey, and
Bible of Tsolyani society. They pervade education and socialization
processes through their repetition in rituals, temples, academies, at
feasts, and around the fires of family life. Consider that the Gods War was
not fought with the grand and good Tlomitlanyal arrayed against the dire
and majestic Tlokiriqaluyal, nor even with the all of Pavar's deities
arrayed against the Goddess of the Pale Bone, but rather with all of
Pavar's deities arrayed against Ksarul. Who is He to deserve such
distinction? Three possibilities exist:

1) Ksarul is much as he is described in the Outer Doctrines of the Temple
of Ksarul. He was the youngest and most brilliant of the gods whose
ambition and impatience lead him into rebellion. He continues to wield
great power, even in slumber, and is fated to one day regain his freedom
(perhaps this time to save Tekumel's multiverse from the pariah deities).

2) Ksarul is himself a pariah deity, perhaps THE pariah deity. The wizard
Eyloa of the Tlashte Heights has conjectured that Ksarul is but a
'contained' form of the One Other. The Gods War and the Battle of Dormoron
Plain are the War Against the Pariah Dieties. This explains the importance
of the Dormoron Plain legends, the imbalance of power amongst the gods, and
the intriguing similarities between the worship of Ksarul and the One Other
(the number "eight", their demon allies, among other things), but also
contains a serious contradiction in that the One Other helps to contain
Ksarul after the Battle of Dormoron Plain.

3) Ksarul is neither a god nor a pariah deity, in any strict sense. He is
an Undying Wizard from long ago, some Doc Savage-type from the Time of
Darkness who found a way to leapfrog up the evolutionary ladder to the
rungs inhabited by the gods. He even surpassed them. This explains why he
is described as the "youngest" of the gods, why Dlamelish had an affair
with him (co-optation through seduction), and why the One Other helped
contain him (i.e., the upstart was a threat to both Pavar's deities and the
One Other). The Gods War is an interlude in an already existing conflict
that continues now that Ksarul is safely contained.

Thus, the Gods War may have come before the War with the Pariah Deities,
after or as a culmination of that war, or even as an interlude or
interruption of that war, depending upon just what Ksarul turns out to be.
One thing is for certain. He is more than he seems.
      Consider who might know the answer...
      Nyelmu of the Garden of Weeping Snows; was it not he whom the
Tlomitlanyal consigned to everlasting torment for having learned by
scattered clues certain secrets of Tekumel's uttermost past...
      Reflect.

Most of our adventures involve great numbers and varieties of so-called "non-
player characters." These are developed as "real people," to the limits of our 
abilities, with likes, dislikes, loyalties, talents, attitudes, etc. They are 
NOT just mechanical extensions of the players. I do not see how one could 
explore very much of Tekumel without recourse to "non-player characters." I can 
see where other genres of role-playing could do with fewer or without such 
characters, but the idea of "just players" exploring a dungeon strikes me as 
quite limiting. Even when we recently played "Call of Ctulhu" (sp.?) we had all 
sorts of non-players with us: the local sheriff and his men, citizenry, a 
doctor, etc. etc. We very much enjoyed the adventure.

Oh, wow! Conspiracy theory on the GodPlanes......

How about (as a horrible and possibly blasphemous suggestion) the idea that
one of the Pariah Gods (perhaps the One Other who is said to want to return
Tekumel to its original universe is in fact the Creator of the said Universe?
That he is the One True God of our Universe trying to return his lost children

[                   bit of fiction on our ftp site.                      ]

Well, fascinating material on how the Gods mold us poor 
humans on Tekumel.  I add some more thoughts/kindling to the flame of
discussion, my lords and ladies.

The cold war comparison is apt, perhaps more apt than the author thought.
I don't believe for an instant that the totality of the Cold War was to
permit the elites of the USA and USSR to grow fat on the 
supressed peoples of the 3rd world (and their own disaffected citizens).
I don't doubt that this happened, and I don't doubt that some of
the elites of both countries took advantage of the situation to do so.
However, the Cold War was definitely the ideological struggle of two
great systems, neither powerful enough to directly confront its foe.
Thus, the war between Stability and Change IS a true struggle, but neither
side wants a direct confrontation with the other, preferring to work
amongst the proxies on the many planes.  The Pariah deities?  Prof. Barker
keeps the cards of these beings close to his chest, but I doubt they
are the only true dynamic operating.  Change and Stability both oppose
the Pariah deities, as the left and right in  the USA both try to
do what they believe is right for the country.  Change and Stability
disagree  as to the best way to run the universe, but they can
agree that they want it to continue (except, perhaps for Vimuhla, who
has reluctantly agreed to let it continue for a time).
  I also doubt Ksarul is a representation of the Pariah Deities.
Remember, Change fought Stability at Dormoron Plane before Ksarul's
plans became obvious, and Change turned against him.  Powerful?  Yes,
but perhaps because he has more allies than the others?   I dunno.
If we're going to see the Pariah Deities under every bush, so to speak,
what about the other Gods?  Hnalla and Hru'u are pretty mysterious, don't
you think?  Most powerful deities in their sides, yet we know next to
nothing about them.  And Dra looks mighty suspiciously like The One Who
Is...

While we're on the subject of paranoia about the Pariah Gods, has 
anybody ELSE noticed that each of the Five Empires has a secret place
that no outsiders may enter?  Consider: Dlash in Livyanu, Hlikku in
Yan Kor, Mu'ugallu in guess where, and Songyal Island in Salarvya?
Tsolyanu has two, with the City of Sarku and the city in the dead
volcano that was discussed here a month ago and I've forgotten it's
name already.  Has anybody explored these places?  Can anybody convince
the Red Hats to send a scout team into Dlash?  I wouldn't be surprised
to discover all these sealed cities have tubeway connections, and a 
common cause, and it may not bregarding the common welfare of the
common being.

I'd put this up as 1.5. So as read the guide tells you who you are, tells 
you who would see around you and then gives some rules/laws about the 
details of the interaction.

[Moderator's Note:  Professor Barker responds to the sealed cities message.  ]

Ngangmuru bruhaya lel brumazik!

Hmm. Paranoia under every bush? Maybe it's the Mob? Reminds me of the 
enjoyable game "Illuminati" that was so popular a few years back.

As for sealed cities, simple ethnic distrust may be enough reason to 
create such a place: e.g. Lhasa in Tibet until recently. Religious 
"purity" is understandable as a sort of over-all reason for Mecca and 
Medina. (There were Christians, Jews, and Pagans in both of these cities 
until after the Prophet.)

As for Dlash, one does wonder aout the "One of Fears." Quite possibly a 
name for one of the three known Pariah Deities, rather than a "new" 
Pariah Deity. Hlikku in Yan Kor is an ethnic-religious site, occupied by 
a sect that makes the Assassins of the mediaeval Middle East look like 
the PTA (Parent-Teacher Association, for you British and European folks). 
Mu'ugallu is also ethnic, with religious overtones: a cult-site for the 
military secret ritues of Lord Hrsh. (What was the name of that castle 
where Himmler used to hold secret initiations and rituals of the SS?) 
Songyal Island is also some sort of cult site, probably devoted to an 
aspect of Shiringgayi who has to do with the sea -- rater like Mretten 
and the other sea-goddesses of the southeast. The City of Sarku and 
Hmakuyal are cult headquarters: both very ancient and full of fanatic 
worshippers. Sarku's minions hold special pilgrimages and celerations 
in his secret labyrinths every year, and nobody knows what the Inner 
Temple of Ksarul does deep in the walls of the crater around Hmakuyal.

Has anybody explored these places?  You might try asking Arjai hiVaisoner, 
who was brought up at Hmakuyal -- in the outer circle, of course. Various 
scholars have visited and written about both of the Tsolyani secret sites, 
and there was even a fellow who pretended to be a priest of Ksarul and got 
into some of the depths under Hmakuyal. He was rather like Sir Richard 
Burton, who knew all the right languages, rituals, and details, and managed 
to get into -- and out of -- Mecca.) Unfortunately, the fake priest of 
Ksarul didn't have powerful enough blocking spells, and the priesthood 
read his mind, identified him, and then gave him what he sought: they 
created an illusion -- for his mind alone --  of a vast labyrinth filled 
with magical devices he could never understand, books he could never read, 
people and creatures he could never speak with, and endless blank hallways 
that led nowhere. I think he's still on display somewhere in one of the
outer halls of the temple.

The Red Hats know better than to try to breach the isolation of Dlash. They 
know about the place from centuries of living next to Livyanu, and they don't 
want to create problems where none currently exists. Militarily, they could 
invade Dlash easily, but there are some things even the greedy generals of 
Ssa'atis don't want to arouse.

They may indeed. Tekumel still has a few mysteries left for future heroes 
to discover. I don't think it will be easy, and it certainly may not be 
"fun" for those involved, but it WILL be interesting.

[Moderator's Note:  Professor Barker replies to the Necomers Guide topic.    ]

The outline is pretty good, though not complete. My "Sourcebook" 
(completely published in one volume by Gamescience, and 2 of 3 vols. 
published by Different Worlds and then taken over by Theatre of the 
Mind) was a more complete attempt. But it suffered from my rather 
stuffy "academic" style: a textbook in Tekumel anthropology, somebody 
called it. Still, all the facts are there. New facts can and should be 
added, and the whole thing should be rewritten. But I lack the energy 
and the urge to write the basics of Tekumel all over again! Although I 
may have completed only two novels, consider the fact that I have written 
2 sets of rules, co-written one more set, published several books and 
booklets (e.g. The Book of Ebon Bindings, the Tsolyani grammar and 
dictionary, a bestiary, 3 vols. of solitaire adventures, a book of Tsolyani 
legion histories ("Deeds of the Ever-Glorious"), troop lists for each of 
the Five Empires, the Sourcebook,  co-authored a couple of sets of wargame 
rules. written articles on other subjects -- etc. In addition to my 
scholarly work: 3 vols. of an Urdu basic course, a 2 vol. course in Baluchi,
3 vols. on the Klamath language of southwestern Oregon, 2 vols. of an Urdu 
newspaper reader, a little reader of modern Urdu poetry, a 3 vol. set of 
classical Urdu poetry (with music tapes), a 10,000 entry bibliographic 
database for Mayan articles and books (using Filemaker Pro), Etc. I need 
another life!

Anybody want to tackle this daunting task? I will stand on the sidelines 
and cheer you on, but I don't have the energy to get involved. Too many 
questions make for a pooped Barker... (Olde Tsolyani proverb)

If this became a Blue Room project, perhaps individual chapters could be 
written by different people, cutting down on the work for any one person. 
My first suggestion would be to boil the Sourcebook, extract facts, rewrite 
in simpler and more direct language, and restructure.

Good luck!

I think the following headings might also be relevant to an introductory guide.

                a. Khishan Languages
                b. Aom Languages

       10. Political Institutions
                a. Tsolyanu
                        i. The "Palaces"
                        ii. The Tlakotani dynasty
                                1. Origins
                                2. Present Political Situation
                b. Mu'ugalavya

        11. The Military
                a. The Legions

                b. Common Legions
                        1. Tsolyani Legions
                        ...
        12. Ancient Technology/Artifacts

I don't know if this helps.

[Moderator's Note:  Bill Faulkner is curious if anyone is going to be at   ]
[                   Gen-Con (burp) this year.   ;)                         ]

Subject: Tekumel at Gen-Con

Just curious about who may be attending Gen-Con this year. The only known
scheduled Tekumel events are PHD games sponsered miniature events Thursday, 
Friday, and Saturday night. They didn't make the pre-reg book, but will be 
held. I will be playing in those events, as well as GM'ing my own RuneQuest
adventure. If there is interest (please e-mail me) I will run the Tekumel 
event that I ran earlier this year at a local con. It would have to be on 
either Friday or Saturday and I only have one open slot on each of those 
days. (Sorry I don't have the schedule with me and I can't tell you which 
slots are freee.)

Anyway, I suggest that all that are interested to play in the miniature 
events (we had a great time last year). If there appears to be enough 
interest in a role-playing event, I will work with Wes Postelthaite of 
PHD games to find a space and time to run it. Hope to see some of you there, 
but I understand those that avoid Gen-Con like a patch of the food of the Ssu.

[Moderator's Note:  David Cheng adds to the Tekumel Primer discussion.       ]

I don't believe Bob Dushay's idea is to re-write and re-present S&G vol 1.
We discussed this the last time we played the Gardasiyal module he
prepared for Origins.

What I believe Bob is looking for is a 2-4 page 'primer' on
role-playing in Tekumel.  Something to hand out to new players at a 
convention, or to new recruits in your campaign game.

The Primer should be something that captures the basic essense of what
makes RPGing in Tekumel 'different.'  It should be filled with "sound 
bites," so to speak.  You shouldn't write a half page on Status.  You 
should write a 1/5th page paragraph, and it should include a sentence
like:
   Status is so important to the Tsolyani that they have 26 
   different ways to address one another, depending on the 
   relative status between the two speakers.

Four pages of small print should do it, including some nice art.
I think things like Ayhogga are particularly good, because of their
uniqueness.  It should be professionally laid-out and printed.

I would go on to talk about how TOME should sponsor this effort, but
we're not supposed to talk about such things here, right?  ;-)
[Moderator's Note:  Right!                                                ]

If we here can collaborate on finalizing the text, I'll volunteer to
do the layout.

[Moderator's Note:  David Bailey asks a few questions.....    :)            ]

Received my copy of Gardasiyal from US today (ok, a bit too late to use in 
tonights game.)  Players are really fired up with questions from current 
campaign, so, before I read all three volumes, here are a few of them:

Midori Ito asks:  If Hirkane Tlakotani was the 'stone upon whom the 
universe rests', and Mirusiya would have been 'the flame that illuminates 
the world', what is Dhitchune's honourific?  Also, I tried to bow heads 
when the Salarvyani ambassador visited the Palace of the Moon last week, 
but we collided (apparently their etiquette is different) and I knocked him 
unconscious.  What gifts should I send to make amends?

[Moderator's Note:  Dhichune has entitled himself, Eternal Splendor.  Which  ]
[                   has not a small number of people a bit worried.  :)      ]
[                   On the Salarvyani ambassador, try a padded skullcap, or  ]
[                   a nice new helmet/head-dress liner, amongst other tokens.]
[                   :)                                                       ]

Emra hiGangassa asks:  If I find a cellar 15 metres below an area of swamp 
that no-one owns, can I claim it and its contents under the Law of the 
Present Hand?  What are the formalities?

Dzin, the lost Livyani girl, asks:  I was found adrift in a coracle after 
fleeing my village on the southern Livyanu coast during the plague three 
years ago.  Is my aunt Mlilin still alive?  Can I return safely alone, or 
should I pay the pirate captain what he asks to return me to my home?

Hinaz Vrimasu the trader of exotic foods and beverages asks: what is the 
current rate of tax on Tsuhoridu and similar items?  Are there any other 
import duties and forms to fill if I wish to import spirits and spices from 
Salarvya and Livyanu to Jakalla?

Zhitlakh hiSomerontur, Chiteng and Company of the Orange Band, asks: is it 
legal to use the Bolt of Immanent Immolation on a slave holding a brass 
candle stick at a dinner party if he insults a guest?  If it is not legal, 
what penalties may I incur?  What if I accidentally hit the guest?  p.s. I 
live in Pala Jakalla, near the walls, and can run fast.

Zorel hiSsayeti, port official, Pala Jakalla:  Who is my ultimate superior 
officer, who runs the OAL now, and why do all these people in brown robes 
want me to pass 'fines' to them?

Mazaholza hiNiriuna, Aridane and Legion of Blue Kirtle:  what is the recent 
history of my legion, after the Deeds of the Ever Glorious?  What happened 
to Dijaya hiQurruluma of the Blue Circle clan?  Should I ask my kasi before 
I take another woman as a lover?

My major domo, Suruna, asks: can a small, low clan be adopted en-masse by a 
high clan, and if so, does it become a low lineage, or is its status 
determined by the fact that it donates several tens of thousands of Kaitars 
and I am sleeping with the clan elder?

[Don't say you weren't warned, Chris!!]
