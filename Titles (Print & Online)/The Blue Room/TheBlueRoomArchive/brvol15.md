These messages are the accumulation of the messages that were sent out on 
the Blue Room email list between May 1995 and June 2000.  A large portion 
of the information is directly from Professor M.A.R Barker. When the list 
members joined during the time the list was active, they agreed to refrain 
from sharing this data with non list members.  When the list ended, it was 
urged that the data be made available to non-list Tekumel fans, and it 
seemed like a good idea all around.

I only ask that if you download these digests, or have received them in 
some other way, please respect the agreements the list members made, and 
refrain from passing them around and instead point people to the Tekumel 
web site, www.tekumel.com so that they can download them for themselves, 
and see all the other material available on the Tekumel.com web site.

Many Thanks.

The Tsolyani Army List contains some information on legion colours. So 
do the other army lists: Yan Kor, Mu'ugalavya, and Livyanu (etc.). This 
information is presented in tabular form at he end of each of these 
booklets. There was also a more general Tekumel Painting Guide that 
Tekumel Games issued a long time ago. It may be available in xerox form 
from some kindly gamer. This is what was partially (?) published in the 
Dragon.

>Could you please enquire as to the current status of the following to 
>gentleman under the new "Emperor"... 

>Lord Chaimira hiSsanmirin, Provest of the High Chancery 
>Lord Qoruma hiRi'inyussa, High Princeps of the Omnipotent Azure Legion

When Dhich'une became Emperor, Lord Chaimira stayed on for several months 
to arrange for a smooth transition. He could not get on comfortably with 
the new boss, however, and retired to his clan's hereditary estates near 
Tsuru. He's still there, as far as I know.

Lord Qoruma hiRi'inyussa had a more difficult time. He fled Avanthar one 
step ahead of vengeful Sarku troops. He managed to get down into the 
Underworld below Avanthar and comandeered a tubeway car, which took him 
and his small party of relatives and personal staff all the way to the 
Urunen lands on the Southern Continent. He lives there now in exile, but 
he keeps up contacts with Tsolyanu via the tubeway network and possily 
through extra-dimensional portals. He is very much on the "wanted" list.

[Moderator's Note:  A message from Nuno Duarte, our first listmember from   ]

Tekumel is iron-poor. Mines are small and not very productive, and it is 
not easy to extract metal from the ore. There are reserves of silver, 
copper, zinc, gold, tin, and some platinum. A little nickel is found in 
Livyanu. Lead is fairly frequent in eastern Tsolyanu and Salarvya. 
Aluminum is found, but the technology to smelt it is not known in the 
regions where it is. Other minor metals may also be available here and 
there. I've never done a resource survey on what's available on Tekumel, 
but I know generally what is possible and what isn't. Gold, silver, and 
copper are common enough to be used for coinage and ornaments. Good steel 
exists only in the form of artefacts from before the Latter Times.

>Chlen hide
>Just a curiousity, in Tekumel most weapons are made of chlen hide, what 
>happens when a hide sword parryes a steel sword? How sharp is the edge of 
>chlen hide weapons? how much do they weight?

Chlen-hide is quite light. Somebody once estimated it to be about the 
hardness and consistency of good, flexible aircraft plastic. A Chlen-
hide sword can be sharpened to a good edge -- as can a plastic knife 
here on Terra -- but it doesn't hold its edge long, and when it is used 
to strike a Chlen-hide or metal shield or piece of armour, it dulls 
rapidly. Hitting a steel sword may break or badly nick a Chlen-hide 
blade. A good steel sword can carve a deep nick about an inch deep in 
a thin Chlen-hide blade, if both strike one another straight-on and
with all the force their wielders can put into them. Chlen-hide armour 
is better against a steel sword since the sword has to hit in a way to 
penetrate, rather than to bounce off or be deflected at an angle.

Hope this helps.

[Moderator's Note:  Jose Ramos from France sends the following note:         ]

        Cheers!

        I have just joined the list, and I thought some people might profit
of the bargains that brought me at last to Tekumel.

        The French gaming store chain "Le Temple du Jeu" seems to be
freeing storage space offering bargains on many items difficult to sell.
Among many 80s games and some cult games I found Gardasiyal at 4$, all the
solitary adventures at 2$ each, Eye of All Seeing Wonder 2 and 3 at 1$,
Tekumel Bestiary at 2$, and the first sourcebook (Different Worlds) for SoG
at 2$. All that at Bordeaux. I do not know if there are other things at
other cities.

[                   send your replies to the list, please!                   ]

        I do not have the address here, but they sell by mail and if
anybody is interested you can mail me by private e-mail (his address is
jose.ramos@univ-angers.fr). This was the 8 November, so I do not know 
what remains.

[Moderator's Note:  David Cheng updates us on the Tekumel Con.              ]

Here is the latest news on Tekumel-Con:

PLACE AND TIME

Victor Raymond, author of the _Tekumel Bestiary_, has stepped forward and
volunteered to apply his expert knowledge of Minneapolis hotels for the
good of Tekumel-Con.  He is currently in what I'll call "stage 2" of
negotiations with our "short list" of classy joints.  We hope to announce
our choice of venue not long after the holidays.

However, one of the finalists is not available for the previously-mentioned
June 6-9 1997 weekend.  If we choose this hotel, we may have to bump down
to the following weekend (June 13-16).  I will certainly keep you all
posted as this critical element of con planning develops.


PUBLICITY AND ATTENDANCE SURVEY

I hope that all of you were covered by our 730+ piece international
publicity mailing.  As announced in a previous update, that mailing
included:
	* introductory cover letter
	* one-page promotional flier
	* list of sources of Tekumel info, lore and products
	* event description form
	* pre-paid attendance survey postcard.

I'd like to confess that I'm a bit disappointed with the response to the
survey.  In Marketing school they teach you that response to mail surveys
is low, but I expected a better response rate given the nature of the
subject matter, the brevity of the survey, and the fact that it was
pre-paid.

If any of you still have your postcard, PLEASE COMPLETE THE SURVEY AND MAIL
IT BACK TO ME.  Don't be bashful admitting you probably won't be able to
attend if that is the case - just knowing this is very valuable to us.
Also, at the very least, it gives me confirmation of your address.  Hey, it
takes about 90 seconds, and it's already paid for.

If you never received a mailer, it is never to late to request one.  Please
email me your postal address and I will get one out to you ASAP.


TEKUMEL-CON NEEDS EVENTS

Many of you checked-off on the postcard that you are interested in running
an event at the con.  However, only two of you (thanks Mssrs Kellogg &
Vossler!) have followed-up with an event description form.  If you're
pretty sure you're going to be there, please send me your event
descriptions ASAP.  The sooner I get a good number of them, the sooner I
can produce a real registration booklet.    I will happily accept event
descriptions by either email or US post.


TOME MAILING

Hopefully many of you have received the nice 8-page catalog that TOME
recently mailed out.  (Note: they used the cleaned-up Tekumel-Con mailing
list).  If you would like one, please contact TOME directly.

Also included in that mailing was a little reminder to send in your
Tekumel-Con survey postcard.  Well, I covered that already . . .


MORE TO FOLLOW

That's all I can think of right now.  More news to follow as it happens.
Please direct any questions to me directly < cheng@io.com >, and not to
Chris here at the Blue Room.

[Moderator's Note:  Bob Dushay asks about Diplomats in the 5 empires.       ]

>1. Basic relations: How do the Five Empires conduct diplomacy?  Are 
>there official ambassadors stationed at the capitals of the Empires, 
>with or without minor embassies at other major cities, or is there a 
>system of roughly equivalent embassies at each major city, with the 
>capital office "first among equals"?  What is the title and status of an 
>ambassador?  Do they have anything related to diplomatic immunity?

The Palace of Foreign Lands is the Tsolyani agency charged with relations 
with other countries, including trade, tariffs, shipping, international 
caravans, and diplomacy. The main headquarters for this agency is in 
Bey Su, with a secondary branch in Jakalla. Tumissa, Chene Ho, and 
Sokatis have smaller but quite capable smaller branches, while other 
border cities (Khirgar, Paya Gupa, Fasiltum, etc.) have lesser offices. 
Internal towns and cities either have just a representative or two, who 
sits in the Palace of the Realm's offices, or none at all. Thus, if you 
want to arrange shipment of something from Hauma or Tsuru, you can do it 
through the local representative -- but it's better to get your clansmen 
in Jakalla or Bey Su to arrange for the caravan or ship, write to 
receivers in the country you're shipping to, and make all the official 
arrangements. There is a large corps of scribes and record-keeprs in the 
offices of the larger cities, who can provide official permits, seals, 
and advice (at a cost, of course!).

The ambassador is usually termed a "Legate" in the Five Empires. One 
speaks of the "Salarvyani Legate at Bey Su," for example. The other 
nations have differing terms for their ambassadors, and not all have 
exact equivalents in terms of duties, authority, etc. The Mu'ugalavyani 
Legate at Tumissa, for example, has to write home to Ssa'atis before he 
can grant travel documents to caravans shipping through the Chakas. Their 
Legate in Butrus writes instead to Kheiris. It is rather complex.

>2. Embassy details: About how large is an embassy at the imperial 
>capital (number of staff, assistants, etc)?  Is the embassy legally the 
>territory of the ambassador's country (as it is in our modern world), or 
>is the ambassador's safety dependent on keeping the ruler of the host 
>country happy?  Do ambassadors usually have armed guards?  Do 
>ambassadors commonly live in the embassy, or do they have a separate 
>residence?  Is the embassy donated by the host country, or just a big 
>house bought by the guest?  Or, is the embassy simply an office of the 
>Palace of the Realm in whatever country it is located in?

Every embassy is different: in Bey Su, the Mu'ugalavyani keep about 20 
of their officers, perhaps 70 or 80 scribes, secretaries, and record-
keepers. The Yan Koryani (after he recent war) have an embassy of perhaps 
12-15 officials, 30 scribes, and a handful of sub-legates who live in 
border cities like Aukesha, Thri'il, and Khirgar; these are subject to 
the Chief Legate in Bey Su. The Salarvyani are confused, as usual: they 
have a chaotic system of independent Legates who owe their allegiance 
sometimes to their own cities first and only then to Tsatsayagga. The 
Legate at Bey Su, for instance, is loyal to the Salarvyani ruler in 
Tsatsayagga, but the fellow at Jaikalor is a member of the leading family 
of Heru; their team in Sokatis was sent by Koyluga, etc. Whether these 
people ever coordinate anything is unknown. They have staffs of about 50 
people each. Other nations have smaller staffs and more limited coverage.

There is no legal extraterritoriality: the God-Emperor of Tsolyanu states 
that he owns all property in the known world anyhow. There is a polite 
fiction, however, that says that the Imperium grants foreign embassies 
the freedom to come and go and to "remain secret" out of the kindness of 
his heart towards those unlucky enough to dwell in benighted foreign lands. 
Hence, there is a tacit and limited sort of extraterratoriality. There are 
indeed armed guards at the gates of every foreign legation. Some of these 
troops are actual natives of those countries, while others are local 
mercenaries. The Mu'uglaavyani have quite a smart set of red-armoured 
soldiers at their embassy. There are slaves, litter-bearers, cooks, 
janitors, and all the rest of the usual Tekumelani aristocratic entourage-- 
including wives, children, concubines, and even a few nonhumans to aid 
nonhumans who are fellow nationsls (e.g. a Tinaliya family living in 
Bey Su at the old Livyani embassy there, a Swamp Folk party resident at 
Tumissa, etc.). Most nations prefer to buy or rent large mansions for 
their embassies abroad. The Mu'ugalavyani legation at Bey Su, for 
instance, was an old, rambling  clanhouse built during the reign of 
Shaira Su; it is rather dilapidated. Just across from it the Tsolyani have 
set up a local headquarters for what are politely called "City Guards." 
These are there to "prevent rioting and ill-feeling."

Most nations also send small teams of representatives to the Tsolyani 
Palace of Foreign Lands in Jakalla and Bey Su. These people can 
immediately facilitate common traffic and travel without making people 
travel across the city to visit the actual embassies themselves. If 
somebody wants a more complex problem solved, he has to go to the main 
embassy, but minor things can be done from the Palace of Foreign Lands 
itself.

>3. Diplomacy details: Do Ambassadors have means to communicate with 
>their host countries beyond the relatively slow system of overland or 
>oversea travel?

Probably some have telepaths who can plug into a chain of their own 
people across to their own lands. This is only for the most important 
messages, however, and is heavily coded and guarded so that others 
cannot read what is being sent. Most messages are written and sent by 
runner, ship, etc.

>4. Any specific details of the Tsolyani embassy in Tsatsayagga would 
>also be appreciated, as my players will be visiting Salarvya for some 
>time.  Thanks!

It's an ugly old grey building on Marching Legion Street, about two 
Tsan from the Imperial palace. The current Legate there is named Dlekku 
hiTankolel, of the White Stone clan, a worshipper of Qon. He is a 
friendly old fellow who speaks fluent Salarvyani, has a passel of 
Salarvyani mistresses and hangers-on, three or four half-Salarvyani 
children who are thoroughly despised by both the Tsolyani and the 
Salarvyani as "half-breeds," and owns an interest in a caravan/
shipping business that sends and receives goods, slaves, etc. across 
Salarvya to cities as far away as Naggas and Nimollu. He tends to try to 
help people from the upper-level mercantile clans, while members of the 
"Dark Trinity" clans may get the runaround unless they bribe him heavily. 
He is a relatively honourable man, however, and has only been known to 
sell a few of his Tsolyani visitors into slavery across in Haida Pakala 
or into something worse in Tsa'avtulgu -- and only then because they 
annoyed him or were arrogant or perhaps worshipped Durritlamish, whom he 
particularly loathes. I always rather liked Dlekku. Don't stand too close 
to him, however, because his breath stinks bad enough to slay a 
Chlen-beast in rut! They say his womenfolk have to eat a Salarvyani 
herb that completely kills the sense of smell. His bodily cleanliness is 
just about as neglected, I am told, too. Stand upwind.

Regards,

Phil

>The information about foreign embassies is quite interesting.
>What is the state of any Livyanu embassies in Tsolyanu since 
>the plague and the Mu'ugalavyani (I hope I remembered the
>right empire) take over?  [You did-M]

>(I do hope those Livyani posted abroad were smart enough to
>stay there during the plague.)

The Livyani legates and their employees in Tsolyanu have had rather a 
hard time of it. Some tried to return home -- and perished of the 
Plague. Others made it. Some stuck it out in Tsolyanu but ran short of 
funds and took to peddling their fancy furnishings, armour, etc. Some 
who had been smart enough to buy into local businesses, land, etc. are 
doing quite nicely and are now thinking how to remove the Mu'ugalavyani 
from Livyanu.

The High Legate, Sikuoz Suriz, is one of the smart ones: he is a member 
of the White Cliff clan, and he managed to persuade the White Stone clan 
of Bey Su to sell him several Tsan of good farming land east of the city. 
He is thus alive and well, and he has started a sort of refugee camp for 
other Livyani in Tsolyanu. Some of his erstwhile subordinates are now 
investing in businesses and planning eventually to go home.

Kormuz Kandesa, the Sub-Legate at Avanthar, went to Bey Su, then home 
by ship. Nothing is known of his fate. The ship was found empty floating 
near Laigas. There seems to have been a battle between its crew and 
unnamed invaders, possibly the Hluss. At any rate, poor Korumuz, his 
wife, his 8 children, and his staff are all missing.

Biyobanaz Achao Mse, the elder statesman of Livyani Legates, had already 
stepped down from his post to be replaced by Sikuoz. Emperor Dhich'une 
did not like this bluff, barrel-chested, bombastic old man and quietly 
urged the Livyani to retire him. He is still alive and well in Bey Su, 
actively aiding Prince Taksuru, and making money by selling off his 
countrymen's jewellery, furnishings, etc. to greedy Tsolyani buyers.

Toraz Arrio, the Consul in Tumissa, stayed on in Tsolyanu, but his two 
aristocratic Livyani wives returned home and perished of the Plague. 
He is a small, active, compact man who had a good future ahead of him 
in the Livyani diplomatic service. He belonged to the Claw of Kirrineb 
clan but was adopted into the better clan of the High Shining Sphere. 
Now he is planning to marry a Tsolyani aristocrat; she has money and 
prestige in Tumissa -- but would have been considered far below him if 
he had stayed in Livyanu.

Taluvaz Arrio, a lineage-mate of the preceding, was spoken of in 
"Man of Gold." He had taken his N'luss wife, Mirure, home to N'luss for 
a visit when the Plague struck. He simply stayed on with her relatives -- 
and has now learned to speak a little N'luss and eat greasy roast Hmelu 
with the best of them! His cousin, Tarshaz Arrio, survived the Plague in 
the Tlashte Heights north of Livyanu. He had gone there on a mission and 
did not perish, though he did become ill for a time.

I haven't kept track of all of the officials, scribes, etc. who used 
to belong to one or another Legation but are now on their own in 
Tsolyanu. In fact, the Tsolyani have been rather friendly to these 
displaced people and have not made objections to their entering into 
business, buying property, etc.

Hope this helps.

I gave him a taste of what it means to be clanless.  

>3 - Is belonging to a clan equal to citizenship in Tekumel? A clanless
>individual has any rights wathsoever before the law?

I explained that clan membership doesn't imply citizenship, or vice versa.

>4 - Women, i think thjey can declare themselves independent or something
>right? Could you elaborate on that?

I explained exactly what Aridani status meant.  He asked a new batch of
questions to my response, and Phil chimed in on them.

>>Someone pays/bribes an official to charge you, to shift blame from them.
>>If
>>you had a clan, they could intercede on your behalf, but since it is just
>>you,
>>you'll probably end up on the wrong side of the Impaler's Stake.  :(

>Hmm...Do they Execute people like that on Tekumel? Impalement?

*Your clan will only intercede on your behalf if you are important or 
*if you have something they want you to do for them. Otherwise, the clans 
*may supply lawyers or pay fines and penalties -- provided that they think 
*you can repay them or will do something really useful for them in the 
*future. A very wealthy clan, like Golden Sunburst or Sea Blue, will usually 
*be willing to help members financially and politically -- but not to the 
*extent of going against the law or risking trouble with the Imperium.

>>Yep.  There are effectively, 2 punishments in Tsolyanu (and maybe the Prof
>>can elaborate on other countries).  Shamtla and Impalement.   Shamtla is
>>the payment of money for injuries done to you by another.  Often the clans
>>involved work out acceptable levels of Shamtla.  Another important reason
>>to have your clan with you.  Everything else is pretty much punishable by
>>Death, and the current method of Death is public Impalement.  Very Gruesome!

*Yes, impalement, unpleasant as it is, is the usual means of capital 
*punishment in the Tsolyani Empire. Shamtla, as Chris points out, is 
*"blood-money": payment to an individual or a clan or even the State 
*itself, for many offenses. If both parties are willing, even a personal 
*murder can be "paid off" with Shamtla.  Offenses against the State and 
*against the temples are not usually resolved by Shamtla but rather by 
*imprisonment or death.

>What are the most current ways of execution on Tekumel? Is there any
>dishonorable death given to very bad criminals?

*Executions in Tsolyanu are usually by impalement. The same is true in 
*Yan Kor, while in Mu'ugalavya one finds beheading, impalement, and 
*various other methods for certain offenses. In Livyanu the common method 
*is to hang the culprit up in a net of fibres that shrink when wet: the 
*victim's body is thus compressed until he/she is asphyxiated. Salarvya 
*is much more grim.

[Moderator's Note:  Yagh. More grim than the compression/asphyxiation stuff? ]

>>Don't know.  Impalement is pretty bad.  I am sure that a clan could probably
>>"convince" the Prison officials to silently, quickly kill a fellow clan-
>>member.

>Is torture common on Tekumel? Is it legal?

>>Common, yes.  Legal, I have no idea.

*It is legal, as it was during the European Middle Ages. It is usually 
*employed to obtain confessions, rather than as punishment in itself. 
*With magical spells being so prevalent, one may wonder why confessions 
*are not simply wrung out of an accused's brain by some state-hired 
*wizard. The answer is that magic is much less common on "real" Tekumel 
*than it is in the game. It is also more uncertain: anyone with enough 
*money can employ counter-wizards to put blocks or false answers into his 
*brain and thus fool the interrogators. Only important cases are solved 
*with the aid of magical interrogation; the average criminal case is
*usually resolved with verbal interrogation, plus some detective work. 
*Physical torture is employed if the interrogators decide they cannot 
*arrive at the correct answer otherwise.

>I want to know a bit more about the azure legion. I read that they are
>"dumb" agents that inform the emperor on everything that goes on the empire.

>>I'll defer to the Professor.   I don't consider them dumb.  They do report

*There is an "intelligence arm" of the Omnipotent Azure Legion and a 
*"military arm." The former consist of a body of agents who operate in 
*every city of the Empire, rather like the secret police of many modern 
*countries. The latter is a regular military legion that is perhaps one 
*of the best in the Tsolyani forces.  Aside form these, a third branch, 
*the "Servitors of Silence," works within the Emperor's Golden Tower at 
*Avanthar as a sort of palace guard, private intelligence force, and 
*administrative corps. These people are rendered speechless when they are 
*accepted into the group, usually at a very young age.  They speak with 
*sign language. They cannot thus gossip or whisper secrets -- although 
*I don't see what prevents them from communicating secrets by sign

I'll toss in a thought or two about some of the questions in this letter.

>1. I recently ran a game based around the two introductory scenarios

I drink "Chumetl" frequently. Yoghurt and buttermailk make up the base, 
to which you add salt, ground red pepper, a little ground cumin and 
ground coriander. My wife, who is from India, calls this "Lassi" -- 
pronunced LUH-see). It can also be made more like a yoghurt milkshake: 
sweet, spiced, and even perfumed with special flavourings. Many people 
turn a little green when yoghurt drinks are mentioned, but they're really 
quite tasty.

[                   come for a visit I'll have to try some.                  ]

>2. A plea: My  partner - and fellow gamer - Julia is a bit dismayed

>what about those ornate cod-pieces I've heard about, hmmm?

Wish I could help, but that's the way Tekumel is. Both sexes often go 
naked or almost naked -- a combination of custom and response to the 
heat. The reason the art does not portray male nudity is largely the 
prudery of American and European males, who can tolerate female nudity 
but not *male* nudity! The prejudice against nudity in western cultures 
is a cultural bias -- it does *not* represent much that is universal or 
anthropologically "always so." Tekumel has no prejudices against nudity. 
If you choose not to play it that way, there is nothing that *forces* 
referees or players to go nude. You are welcome to cling to your 
prejudices on Tekumel, just as you can here on Terra. There are always 
variations and personal preferences. Some Tekumelani choose to wear 
more, some less. Some prefer less emphasis on sex, while others spend 
long hours in the templs of Ladies Dlamelish and Hrihayal. Whatever 
life style you wish...

[Moderator's Note:  I'll chime in on this here, too.  You can just imagine ]
[                   what would be said if there had been male nudity in    ]
[                   Tekumel publications.  TOME couldn't even display/sell ]
[                   The Book of Ebon Bindings as it was at GenCon.  The US ]
[                   (I don't pretend to know about other countries) is so  ]
[                   uptight about nudity, even more so male nudity, that   ]
[                   you would doom yourself if you published it in Tekumel ]
[                   work.  Of course, nude females are fine.   Go figure?  ]
[                   Feminists would say it is another way male dominated   ]
[                   society exploits women, and treats them as 2nd rate    ]
[                   citizens.  They might be right, but this is not an     ]
[                   arena for that debate.  Suffice it to say, there are no]

[                   tigrade I think).  The less you wear on Tekumel the    ]
[                   more comfortable you are apt to be.  Julia can be angry]
[                   at our incredibly idiotic idiosynchrasies, not at Tek- ]
[                   mel in general.  If anything, the Tekumelyani have a   ]
[                   much more balanced and equal social view concerning    ]
[                   this type of thing.                                    ]

>3. On clan symbols: the Tsolyani love ardornment and symbols of rank, 
>which leads me to ask just how much about an individual can one tell

Many people wear clan symbols and clan colours. Most people recognise 
the icons of the 20 deities of Pavar's pantheon. Many recognise the 
symbols of the major clans -- and those clans in their own environs. 
Fewer people would know clan symbols from farther away -- geographically 
and socially. Thus, a fairly educated Tsolyani might not know the 
specific livery of a clan from a distant city or a foreign country. 

>4. If Tekumel is in a pocket dimension in the physical sense, can the 
>Planes Beyond be used to get back to humanspace? Has this been tried? 
>It seems odd to be so cut off in one sense and so free to hop around 
>the Planes Beyond in another. Sorry if I'm being dim about this 
>aspect of things.

Theoretically, it is possible to "walk the Planes" And get back to 
humanspace. But it is *very* far and a *very* complicated road. Only 
the book, "Waba's Almanac" even hints at such a journey, and it is 
mostly lost, corrupted, or confused. The Planes you can "hop around 
in" are those within a limited region of interplanar "reality." 
Humanspace is not in this region at all.

>5. A point about non-human languages and why humans may find it impossible to 
>learn them; in Harry Harrison's "West of Eden" a young human tries to 
>learn the language of his reptilian slave-masters but cannot do so 
>with any great success. This is because the non-humans use physical 
>postures in body language that he cannot make (they have a tail for a

>according to mood and

>that some races don't communicate with gestures, sounds, or smells 
>that a human just can't pick up? Non-humans could find the relative 
>simplicity of verbal language quite easy, though I'd think they'd 
>have trouble with nuances; also physical perhaps, like facial 
>expressions. Speaking with a non-human in human language could be 
>slightly unnerving, like speaking to a complete stranger on the 
>'phone for an extended time. Pregnant pauses and the like. 

It is difficult for humans to master the mind-sets that characterise 
nonhuman thinking, plus the speech organs are different. Many nonhuman 
species possess the requisite speech organs, but they always have an 
accent, and some are near-unintelligible even after years of living in 
the human empires. Humans employ relatively fewer speech mechanisms 
(e.g. differences in the pharynx and larynx needed to speak Shen, 
clacking and clicking of chitinous mandibles used by the Pe Choi, the 
gut-rumbling and vibrating air-intake required for the Ahoggya -- etc. 
To simplify all of this, I simply wrote in the first EPT that humans 
*could not* acquire nonhuman languages. This partially represents 
reality and partially is a game-device to keep players from gaining 
skills they logically cannot ever have. Ability in a nonhuman language 
is really very limited, while nonhumans have comparatively less trouble 
learning one or more human languages. You are, of course, able to play 
the rare human who has grown up in a nonhuman environment -- like Harsan 
in the novel "Man of Gold." But in order to keep the focus on the humans 
on Tekumel, I myself prefer just to claim -- for *game* purposes -- that 
competency is not feasible.

Phil

[Moderator's Note:  Brendan Knox asks about assassins and magic.             ]

>Just a thought I've had regards assassins on Tekumel, for what reason

There are always traitors, defectors, and people who would go the extra 
Tsan to acquire undue influence. The *game* makes magic out-of-bounds 
for assassins, but on *real* Tekumel, a small number of individuals 
have always been able -- and allowed -- to acquire magical power as 
well as status as assassins. They are very rare and exist only with 
the permission of their clans.  I prefer to limit such possibilities 
in order to avoid the inevitable player with a "Superman" complex.

Parakhana Province? I'm not familiar enough with Milumanaya to recognise 
it. Is it over on the Sunraya side, or on the western flank of the great 
desert? Both are pretty dry and dessicated regions.

I have scribbled down a few more words and phrases -- but very little,

specific word, I may be able to supply it -- I can't do a major additional 
vocabulary, of course.

[                  shares how he is going to start his players on Tekumel.  ]

Having just read through the Blue Room digests I was very interested 
in the discussions around the ways to start campaigns. The text 
below is the skeletal outline of the way I'm planning to do it for my 
old playing group who are coming dwon for the SuperBowl weekend. I've 
already tried the "just off the boat" method, which was very 
successful, but wanted to try my hand at designing something myself. 
Comments, tips, suggestions, would be very welcome, as would any 
possible problems with this approach.

BACKGROUND
2350: A member of the Bright Sword clan in Jakalla flees his gambling 
debts rather than be sold into slavery to pay his creditors. His wife 
and offspring are sold instead and the clan does not redeem them. The 
truth behind these events is more sinister than it appears, even if 
the clansman really is an inveterate gambler; the wife is a truly 
beautiful clangirl, an entertainer of some skill and repute, and a 
wealthy member of the Glory of the Worm clan coverts her mightily. 
This Sarku worshipper hatches a plan through contacts (and 
blackmail/bribery) in the Collar of Bronze clan (slavers), the Hands 
of Compassion clan (prison guards) and the Golden Lintel clan 
(moneylenders); the debtor will be disposed of quitely, with the 
public explanation that the man has absconded. His debts will be 
called in in full by the Golden Lintel and when the man doesn't 
appear his wife and children will be handed over to the Collar of 
Bronze. A guardsman in the Hand of Compassion makes sure that no 
messages to or from the family's clan are received and a quick sale 
of the wife is made to the lustful Glory of the Worm member. The 
children are sold off independently, as the Sarku worshipper has no 
need of them. The records show that they are purchased by an agent of 
a Salarvyani, a noble of the powerful Koyluga family.

2350-2364: The eccentric and paranoid Salarvyani has trained the 
chilldren -  now  entering adulthood - as his personal retinue. To 
outside appearances they are no more than dancers, singers, servants. 
and companions. But to their master they are also spies, thieves, and 
confidants. The Salarvyani - a ranking member of the Den of 
Profitable Joy - trust no-one, not even close family, and bought 
young, impressionable slaves to be his eyes and ears. No-one will 
notice them and most will think this purchase an indication of sexual 
perversion of another example of their mad uncle's foibles. His plan 
does indeed go (mostly) unnoticed, though in the strife that beset's 
Salarvya's great families it bears little real fruit. Still, the 
noble grows attached to his slaves as his years advance, and he 
treats them well.

2365: The noble breathes his last, and his will leaves instructions 
that his slaves are to be freed and may return to their homeland. The 
will starts the campaign proper, spelling out some (but not all) of 
the details above, which the Salarvyani knows. The young men and 
women must return to Tsolyanu before the Den of Profitable Joy or the 
noble's family get suspicious and have them disappear permanently.

THE CAMPAIGN
This can go in various directions, though thematically should centre 
around family, clan, and revenge, all subjects close to the Tsolyani 
heart. For maximum drama the Bright Sword clan could have been wiped 
out in the 15 years the siblings have been away, probably by the 
machinations of the Golden Lintel clan (once they saw an open jugular 
they really went for it). That would leave the PC group essentially 
clanless, opening up options for (a) reforming the Bright Sword and 
restoring it (b) trying to gain protection or membership of another 
clan while exacting revenge. Perhaps they could use the Emerald 
Circlet's lifestyle to hide their mission, or maybe the Scarlet 
Mantle (who always claimed to be warriors), or for rough and ready 
training how about the Scarlet Planet of Knives clan (my personal 
favourite clan name!).

With some sort of base to operate from the PCs can go about plotting 
revenge. They may have a case for the assassin's clans but that may 
be too expensive, not feasible because the only real crime is the 
murder of a low-life gambler, or simply not as satisfying as the 
personal touch. Whatever, the PCs should discover the links between 
the protagonists in the sordid story slowly, peeling away each facade 
as it comes and engineering their downfall. The lone prison guard is 
easiest, the slavers rather harder, the Golden Lintel a real 
challenge, and the Glory of the Worm clansman a really tough job.

Other complications can be added if desired: a pursuing party of 
Salarvyani assassins; the Sarku guy's rising status on the coat-tails 
of Dhichune; the discovery of their father alive but blinded, begging 
on the streets of Jakalla (how'd that happen?). Has the mother 
actually become attached to her master? What about the purchasing 
agent, could he blow their cover? And so on.

Due to their unorthodox background the PCs will have skills not 
possessed by your everyday Tsolyani but will still need a judicious 
dose of wits and luck to succeed. The players don't have to know a 
lot about Tekumel to play (after all, their characters were in a 
foreign country for most of their formative years, and Tsolyanu will 
be mostly unfamiliar). Beyond the importance of clan and the basic 
injustice of the campaign premise, details can be added as needed. On 
the other hand it could work for experienced groups, and the GM could 
run some sessions in Salarvya before the old guy croacks. 

That's it. 

CHEERS...Ray

Special Announcement.  One of our listmembers has been working very closely
with Phil to bring Kevuk to the Macintosh computer platform.  So, without 
further ado (whatever that means!) here is his announcement. 
------------

Avanthar Software is proud to present MacKevuk.

What is MacKevuk you ask?  Well it is the result of a few months of hard
work on the part of Professor M. A. R. Barker, and Zane Healy, with
contributions by several other people.  It is also the first of what we
hope will be several Tekumel oriented games from Avanthar Software.

It is a shareware game that should run on most Macintosh computers that are
running System 7 or higher, and have a 68020 or better processor.  In it
you take the part of a player in a game of Kevuk at a party.  Kevuk being a
very popular Tsolyani gambling game that uses dice.  Fortunes will be won
and lost!  What remains to be seen is, will it be you that wins a fortune,
or the other party goers?

The unregistered version will allow you to play the game for a couple of
dozen throws before it quits.  The registration fee is an inexpensive
$10.00US, and will result in you being given a Registration Number that
will allow you to play until you go broke, or quit with your fortune made!

It should soon be available from the Blueroom FTP list, but in the mean
time you can get it from the following Web Page:
http://www.dragonfire.net/~healyzh/MacKevuk.html please be forwarned this
isn't the speediest of servers.

kevuli mssuran, tlakevukayal!

Zane
---------

The game is available from the Blue Room ftp site.  It is in the approved
directory.  Have fun!

Another reason is that many clans do not have the facilities or space 
to host truly massive parties with lots of guests, food, entertainment, 
and prestige.  Holding a party at one of the hostelries is thus a good 
idea.  Entertainment in lavish surroundings with hot and cold running 
dancers, mimes, gambling, athletic contests, and all the pizzaz that goes 
with this is a very posh way of gaining a name for oneself and one's 
clansmen.  Naturally, lower clans need not apply if the social distance is 
too great: e.g. if a low clan wants to invite the Governor of Jakalla or 
a delegation from Sea Blue, they might just as well forget it -- a polite 
but short refusal is all they'll get.

>Joe Saul

All true, but, as said above, just having really smooth catering and 
high-class entertainment is one of the major objectives of this sort 
of thing.  If you are visiting another city, and your clanhouse there 
is "full up," you may also want to stay at a fancy hostel that matches 
your dignity.  You do *not* stay at "Joe's Flophouse" if you are of 
high clan, even if it puts you out of pocket a bit.  People come to know 
of your perceived "chintziness" and lack of "class," and your reputation 
goes down accordingly witgh your friends, your clan, and the rest of 
society. 

Avanthar is another issue.  There is so little room inside the citadel 
that only small delegations can be accommodated there.  Servants and 
entourages stay  in the village of Avanthar across the river.  Sometimes
even a good clan cannot find space because their small allotted 
"clanhouse" inside the citadel is full, and you can't just eject people 
unless they are of much lower status.  Some choose to stay across the 
river, pretending that they have chosen to stay out in the fresh air of 
their own free will, while others quietly return home or send in just one
or two people as representatives.

Phil

[Moderator's Note:  Two questions have come up on demographics and the Prof-]

[                   he can.  The first question comes from Richard Martin.  ]

I am *not* up on demographics and cannot answer questions on this topic 
any more than the man in the street could tell you the population of 
London. There are no texts or treatises in Tsolyani on the matter, 
except for Imperial tax rolls and records which would require a legion 
of scribes and some years to cull and systematise. As may be imagined, 
these records are partial at best. They are written in a variety of 
bad scribal hands, and each city has a different system for maintaining 
the information!
 
>There was a discussion in the eye of all seeing wonder a while back as
>to the population of the Empire, with an 'official' figure of 275
>million being compared with a calculated figure of 80-100 million
>(based on a population density from ancient china)

Either or neither may be correct. Agriculture in the empire is quite 
intensive, and population all along the Missuma River is fairly dense. 
I am frankly at a loss to provide an accurate figure. Not my cuppa, 
as they say...

>I am more interested in the sizes of individual clans than the Empire

>and 1000 minor clans within the Empire. If we assume that an average
>minor clan is half the size of a major then the average major clan

>population)

I do not believe the clans of lesser or minor status are necessarily 
smaller than the major and prestigious clans. The lesser clans are 
those containing a high percentage of the farmers, craftsmen, 
peasantry, etc. while the socially important clans have smaller 
populations: bureaucrats, nobles, priests, soldiers, city function-
aries, "quality" tradespersons, and the like.

I cannot give a better estimate than this writer has done.

This is so. The clanhouses are the central headquarters of the clan 
within a city; individual family groups may live in their own housing 
nearby; some members live on clan lands in the suburbs; others live 
farther away on clan-owned estates. Houses belonging to clan A may be 
intermingled with those of clans B,C, D, etc. within an area of a city, 
so that it is hard to designate any single city area as "the Golden 
Bough" quarter, etc.

>One could argue that there might be several clanhouse's in the city ,
>and possibly for the richer clans that might be so , though one would
>have to consider whether the palace of a particular lineage of family
>is to be considered as a clanhouse.

As noted above: usually a central "ancient, traditional, headquarters-
like" clanhouse, a number of satellite family houses, palaces and 
mansions of those members who have "made it" or whose ancestors made
it, etc. These satellites and individual homes are not usually 
designated "clanhouses."

>However even in western cities
>craftsman of a particular type tend to congregate together , then in
>the close knit community of a clan it is difficult to see why they
>would separate themselves into separate clanhouse's.

The clan takes priority over craft-allegiances, usually. There are 
"districts" where various crafts congregate: tanners, smiths, 
glassblowers, cloth manufacturers, etc. all have their own "streets" 
or "districts" in various Tsolyani cities. This varies from city to 
city, of course: some cities are more "clan-based" than others where 
craft-based districts are more frequent. The clans are ancient and 
have long historical, religious, and mythological connections. It 
appears that over the centuries many clans slowly gravitated into 
craft-based specialities. Some of these became a clan's *only* 
business; other clans are more eclectic. Some have no "trade" at all; 
others cater to persons of specific social roles: e.g. priests of a 
given temple or related temples, scribes, bureaucrats, soldiers, etc.

>To summarise , I see a clanhouse as a rambling district of the city

The "clanhouse" is a centralised entity, physically and societally. 
You are correct in seeing it as surrounded by satellite houses of 
individual families and members. There are workshops and warehouses 
for a clan's specific trades and businesses, always within easy 
walking distance of the central headquarters, where communal eating
in the clan's refectory, clan meetings, religious celebrations (of 
those clans that are fairly limited in sectarian membership), etc. 
are performed. Outside the city there are both large and small 
satellite lands and businesses operated by clan members. A few 
families and individuals may live in housing that is quite distant 
and distinct from the rest of the clan: e.g. a noble's palace on the 
opposite side of a city from the clan's major holdings. These 
"outsiders" are not necessarily cast-outs or disaffected or even 
separate religiously or socially -- they just happened to inherit or 
build or buy lodging that is fairly far from the rest of their clan. 
Many would actually prefer to live closer, but through accidents of 
business and history, they are stuck off in another district somewhere.

I wish I could be of more definite help, but demography is *not* what 
I know best!

Phil

[Moderator's Note:  The second question focuses on clan sizes and is from   ]
[                   Jim Chapin.                                             ]

I am *not* up on demography. I see things visually and not in terms 
of statistics and analyses. If you ask me what the Golden Bough 
clanhouse in Jakalla looks like, how it is furnished, who lives 
there, and the like, I can probably reply with some accuracy. But 
if you ask for numbers and structures, I cannot give any definite 
reply.

>The questions about clans reminded me of one that I have been meaning
>to ask for a while: what is the SIZE of an average clan in Tsolyanu?
>How many people?

"Average?" Do you mean urban or rural, high or low prestige, craft-
based or eclectic? How old in historical/mythological terms? Limnited 
to one city, one region, or spread all across the Empire? Some very 
prestigious clans are fairly limited and small in numbers (e.g. Cloak 
of Azure Gems, Tlakotani), while some less-prestiged agricultural 
clans have houses, estates, lands, businesses, etc. all across the 
Empire and probably thus number in the thousands or even more (e.g. 
White Stone).

>In fact, I realize that I don't know what the population of each of
>the Five Empires is.  Given the huge size of the military forces, they
>must be pretty large.

They are very large. Again, not being a demographer, I cannot do more 
than offer very rough estimates. If one considers the usual inflations 
and deflations of figures in these societies (due to nationalism and 
a desire to please one's readers) these estimates are even more shaky. 
Just as figures for ancient armies were seriously inflated here on 
Terra, it is likely that figures submitted to the Petal Throne are also 
exaggerated. I don't think there has ever been a census of Yan Kor, nor 
of Livyanu, where statistics are kept secret as a matter of course. 
Mu'ugalavya is said to have about two thirds of the population of 
Tsolyanu, and Salarvya is a vast ungovernable and mostly unknown 
questionmark!

As said in a previous posting, the largest clans are those that provide 
the agriculture, the crafts, and the lower echelons of the bureaucracies. 
Military clans and those devoted to individual trades and crafts come 
next, and others fall in behind. Beyond this generalisation, it is 
impossible to be definite.

With apologies,

Cities are rarely thoroughly sacked. The great Maya cities were 
"sacked," according to the records, yet one reads of them active 
and regrouped in a following generation (e.g. Palenque, sacked by 
Calakmul *twice* within a few years, but up and about again soon 
after). This is more like the Five Empires than the sack of Troy 
or the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans in 70 C. E. (Christian 
Era). The contents of the great palaces, the shops, the homes of the 
wealthy, and other repositories of wealth and goodies are usually 
looted, but the buildings themselves are not destroyed except by 
sieges: e.g. set afire by invading troops, broken down by artillery, 
torn down to make way for an invader's triumphal entry, and the like.

Temples are usually walled and guarded by contingents of temple 
guards, who may fight furiously to preserve the sanctuaries of the 
gods. A wise general calls a halt to looting in the temples and 
often allows himself and his men to be bought off by worried clergy. 
If his troops worship one or more of the gods of Pavar's pantheon, 
it is also not wise to arouse hostility among those who worship the 
same or related deities in a city one has conquered. These people 
have friends, relatives, and clansmen at home in the victor's own 
city, and there is no point in giving them good reason to rebel.

Quite so.

Famous landmarks are usually pretty stout architecture. They may be 
taken over by an invading force, but destroying them is another problem 
entirely!  Works of art and treasures are indeed fair game, although 
the conquering general may well demand to know just who has taken what 
and where the best items are now! A Mu'ugalavyani soldier who seized 
valuable statues or gold icons from the House of the Gilded Wing Clan 
in Tsamra will certainly find it difficult to carry them home -- or 
even hide them, with his comrades watching and aware of the penalties. 
Instead, the soldier will probably hand them over to his officers to 
be entered into the plunder roll. He will attach his name and ask only 
for fair compensation, which is usually given -- no officer wants 
disgruntled soldiers who feel they were cheated! It is true that many 
treasures are sent off to the victor's homeland, of course. The 
conquerors may keep certain items, dedicate them as offerings to their 
own temples (where they will be preserved and valued), or hand them 
over to their own superiors as "grease for the mill."

Marya's "Woman of Tsamra" is a bit too large to be carried off easily. 
More likely the Red hats will leave it where it is -- or later arrange 
a major convoy to carry it back to Ssa'atis. ... If they last that 
long in Livyanu...

[                   Aridani, who tends to do so?  Etc.  Phil replies.       ]

> Hi Phil.  This question comes from me.  
>As we all know, Aridani status is there for women to claim themselves as 
>equals wrt. status.  Now, knowing that the popular view of women in Tsol-

Aridani status is ancient and traditional. The "good clan girl" is 
*not* the only standard for women. A girl who announces that she 
wishes to become Aridani may meet some opposition from her family, 
particularly from clan aunts and others who had hoped to see her 
happily married to "Cousin Chignats," with grandchildren, a household, 
and all other other perquisites of married bliss that go with him. 
If she insists, there are others in almost every clanhouse who
will defend her choice: "Remember Aunt Fiyela, who made it to the 
rank of Captain in the Legion of Lady Mrissa? Remember Grandma Gagula, 
who earned so much money and prestige for the clan when she was 
promoted to the rank of 3rd chamberlain in Prince Rereshqala's palace? 
Remember your brother's sister-in law, Dilomel, who was posthumously 
given the Imperial Gold of Glory for martyring herself on the walls 
of Tumissa during the War of 2020?" 

>I would imagine that it would have to be done at a fairly young age, so that
>the proper skills would be tought to the young woman in question.  

Exactly. If she decides later on, in adulthood, she does not have 
to have Aridani skills in advance. She may have an eye on a job as 
a bureaucrat, a priestess, or even a soldier, and be willing to 
spend some time learning her new role. Her clan will probably help 
her. After all, a clever and talented young person will bring in 
more prestige -- and money -- for her clan than a somewhat discon-
tented clan-wife to Cousin Chignats.

>I see also that there might be pressure brought to bear, such as when 
>children tell their parents things here in the US, and they are pressured
>to not make those choices, or to suppress themselves in some way because
>of course, the parent knows best.

This is human nature. It may even apply to the Pe choi and others. 
Your parnts are "the luck of the draw," however, in every culture in 
every age. A smart parent may say, "Please don't decide now, dear. 
Wait until you grow up a little." I know this is rather like the 
American girl who at age 10 wants to run off to become a striptease 
artist in Las Vegas -- but there are those for whom "just say no" is 
never loud and firm enough! In any case, the role of Aridani is 
considered a good and noble one -- not like a go-go girl in a bar in 
some Terran city. Even a girl who states that she wants to become a 
priestess of Dlamelish or Hrihayal may receive no more than some 
quizzical words and looks from her Hnalla-worshipping parents and 
kinfolk. Remember that these roles are societally approved -- unlike 
our own straitlaced society. Tekumel is decidedly less puritanical 
and hypocritical than modern North America (some portions and strata
thereof). 

>So, do most Aridani women come from families where the clan-parents have 
>some Aridani women? Or do most Aridani come from families with no Aridani
>women?  I know it will probably be hard to generalize.

It is hard to generalise, as you suggest. Most clanhouses, at least 
in urban ones, have several examples of both "good clan girls" and 
Aridani whom everybody mentions as role-models -- both good and bad. 
There are Aridani and non-Aridani in almost every stratum of society. 
There are also those who have given up Aridani status later in life -- 
and those who have finally made the declaration.  This is not limited 
to age or social station. From earliest times in Tsolyanu, it has been 
considered a woman's right to make this decision at any time in her 
life, even after she has had her family and reached an advanced age.

>I am sure that a
>child with no Aridani relatives could see a woman stride into the clan-

Yes. It is also possible for a child to see a happy, confidant "good 
clan girl," who fulfills her role very well and is accepted as a 
"power" in the bosom of her clan and family.

[My note:  I didn't mean to say she couldn't see the happy confident good  ]

The sites you mention are indeed active -- at least rumbling and spewing 
smoke occasionally. No major eruptions for centuries, luckily. There are 
other volcanic locations on the other side of Tekumel and in the southern 
hemisphere, but none near the Five empires that I know of. -- A few hot 
springs in Yan Kor are exceptions.

>-Was the Dry Bay of Ssu'um originally part of the inland sea that covered
>southern Yan Kor and part of Milumanaya?

Yes. This is what Sa'a Allaqiyani scholars think. The very fine quality 
of the sand has been explained -- or at least theorised -- by a Yan 
Koryani savant whose name I cannot now recall: he said the Dry Bay was 
caused by the Demon known as "The Beast Without a Tail," who was penned 
there by its foes. It drank all the water and walked around and around 
until it had reduced the rocky floor of the valley to fine mud, which 
then dried to become sand.

>-There are ruins in the territory of the Pygmy Folk and near the Hlaka
>territory. Are these both ruins of non-human habitations and could you
>possibly give a brief description of what they look like?

Never been there myself. The Yan Koryani say that they are monolithic 
walls and circles of rough-cut stones erected by some ancient people. 
They are said to stand upon a foundation that is very different, moreover: 
a perfectly flat, stone "floor" that is decorated with peculiar, 
labyrinthine designs made of sheets of many-hued glassy stuff. There 
are occasional places where blocks have broken and fallen through into 
halls and chambers below. Nobody knows what this means, and those who 
have investigated have not seen fit to come back again...

These legal niceties differ from place to place. The Tsolyani consider 
the Pe Choi of Do Chaka to be Tsolyani citizens. They are ruled and 
taxed and treated much like anybody else in the Empire. The Pe Choi 
are smart enough to keep quiet and not make waves; the Tsolyani, in 
turn, are smart enough not to press too hard. The "wild" Pe Choi of 
the inner Chakan forests are fearsome fighters: able to strike, raid, 
loot, and return to their jungle fastnesses quickly. There has been a 
sort of understanding between the humans and this species that goes 
back millennia. The Pachi Lei, on the other hand, are considered regular 
citizens, who are treated identically with human citizens. The 
Mu'ugalavyani consider their Pe Choi to be regular citizens of a 
slightly lower quality than humans, and they thus do not appoint them 
to higher posts of government, etc. The Swamp Folk, on the other hand, 
are used by the Mu'ugalavyani in their navy and hence obtain higher 
positions and pay. The Pygmy Folk of Yan Kor consider themselves an 
autonomous enclave; they treat their human neighbours with aloof 
politeness and vice-versa. The Tinaliya in Livyanu are similar: their 
underground cities are almost completely free of Livyani control, which 
appeals to the Livyani too.  The new conquerors after the Plague (i.e. 
the Mu'ugalavyani) have not had time or inclination yet to oppress the 
little Tinaliya, but this will almost certainly occur -- the 
Muu'ugalavyani are officious and blind when it comes to intercultural, 
interracial, inter-whatever, sensitivity.

The Ahoggya are intractable. They obey human laws when in human cities, 
and they remain aloof from human affairs in their own lands (right up 
to completely ignoring humans among them -- not even offering a bowl of 
water to a thirsty human visitor, but just letting the poor fellow find
it for himself!). Their stilt-villages are independent even from each 
other, and the Salarvyani let them be.

The Shen are much more interested in political structures: they have 
their own governments in Shenyu, Mmatugual, and the little northern 
Shen states. They treat humans as foreigners who must go through 
considerable bureaucracy to achieve anything, and they are clever at 
trading and commerce. Their laws are so confusing to humans that even 
the Tsolyani legate in Ssorva has to ask for help in interpreting their 
edicts.

The inimicals (Ssu, Hluss, Hlutrgu, Shunned Ones, etc.) are treated as 
foes wherever they are found. Their special enclaves are theirs only 
because they fight ferociously to defend them, and their lands are not 
important enough for any of their neighbours to be willing to mount the 
sort of massive military force it would take to expunge them permanently 
from Tekumel. The Ssu, for one thing, dwell in undergorund cities where 
there are ancient tubeway car tunnels connecting these once-human sites 
to other places on Tekumel. Millennia ago the humans of Pechano and 
Salarvya managed to destroy the Ssu capital of Ssuganar, but the Ssu 
simply retreated grimly into their tunnels and nobody dared follow them. 
They are a very patient species.

Can't help you much with star systems because my memory is no longer what 
it used to be; I *think* the Hokun originally came from Alpha Pegasi, but 
their dominions extended into other systems nearby as well. My original 
formulation of these races' home systems was based upon a 1940's vintage 
star-book that I no longer possess. I don't even recall the title. Now I 
have a software astronomical application; if it shows these star systems, 
I'll let you know.

[Moderator's Note:  Shawn Bond asks about Baron Ald and the Yan Koryani,    ]
[                   tomb robbing, and also about Non-humans and their magic.]

>I would like to enquire of Prof. Barker about the Yan Koryani presence
>in Jakalla during the (very brief) time that Ald was "First General of the

Ald did not send any Yan Koryani units to Jakalla during his tenure as 
First General. He had with him about 100 of his own personal guard, and 
Dhich'une supplied the rest of Ald's "bodyguard" (who were guarding Ald 
as much as they were guarding Ald's opponents). One of Ald's old friends, 
mentioned in one of the pieces in "Adventures on Tekumel," vol. 3, I 
think, commanded the entourage.  It was all done smoothly and without 
public fanfare. I can't quite recall all the details now and don't have 
instant access to my notes on the events.

The Temple of Sarku would be horrified to learn of tomb looting. The 
looters would be impaled or worse, and the loot would be ceremoniously 
restored to the tomb. All except any amounts quietly confiscated by the 
Temple.

Looting of tombs is a no-no, even for the Temples of Sarku and 
Durritlamish -- *especially* for those temples! No motive or goal is 
really so compelling that this law could be broken with impunity. The 
thieves must be be brought to justice -- and it would not be beyond the 
Temple of "arrange" for a little pillaging and then bring the culprits 
before the temple courts! This might seem hypocritical and dishonest to 
us, but the Tsolyani are usually able to see the "nobility" or 
"ignobility" of the long-term goals. 

>I considered

This is true, but there are those in the Temple who would do everything 
in their power to see to it that the emperor never learned whence this 
wealth came from!

>Also, I though that the temple heads would have a "me first" attitude
>about plundering such a tomb.

They wouldn't dare -- openly.

All true, but none of this could ever be brought into the open. The Temple 
of Ksarul would retaliate against any such besmirching of their noble 
dignity and reputation.

A good argument -- and about as effective as it was in "Man of Gold." 
Most folk see right through such rationalisations.

>The worm lords further added that the presence of a shrine to their Lord of

It's another rationalisation. Nobody would be fooled -- which doesn't 
stop people from saying it and pretending they believe it.

>And as a last (but not least) question; could Phil give some descriptions
>of the kind of magics that the Enemies of Man use?  The Ssu are said to be
>very sorcerously inclined, and are very adept at using the Energies from

Rather similar to human spells in effect, though the mechanics are 
different somewhat. I cannot go into details, nor would that be either 
useful or reasonable here. I have always just used the same human spells 
for the nonhumans to avoid proliferation and confusion -- after all, the 
very names of these spells are all in Ssu chiming or Hluss growling and 
hissing. The mechanics of Other Planar power and the bringing through of 
energy to mould it here into matter or power are the same; details differ. 
There are some interesting nonhuman spells, though: e.g. last night one 
of the players was afflicted with a powerful nonhuman spell that did 
nothing more than cause his left hand to turn bright golden yellow. This 
yellow colour then began to spread slowly up his arm.  Since he is a 
priest of Dlamelish, he felt that this hue was fdecidedly wrong for him, 
and he strove to get rid of it in every way he could. His human 
disenchantment spells all failed, and the colour kept spreading slowly. 
Finally his comrades got him up the time line to the College at the End 
of Time, where a Tinaliya (one K'kes, whom some may recall with pleasure, 
others with loathing) managed to disenchant him with a specifically 
Tinaliya spell.

I suggest that people "wing it" with their nonhuman spellcasters. Keep a 
record of the spells you invent and use, so you can repeat them in your 
games. Please don't expect them to become "authentic Tekumel" -- just 
enjoy! Maybe some time we can get around to codifying them. Most useful 
spell effects, I have found, are already in the Tekumel spell corpus, 
although all the nonhuman details are still to be worked out.

>manifestations do their spells take (fireballs, bolts of crackling blue
>energy, sickly roiling walls of greenish-yellow gasses that dissolve
>flesh)? 

Lovely. You have some of the basic ideas precisely.

>Perhaps if Phil could give a few examples of the kinds of spells
>that the Ssu have used against players in his own campaign world (I'm
>thinking along the lines of an excellent article concerning Tinaliya magic
>in an Imperial Courier).

There are lots of such spells. Most are similar to human spells, or else 
are harmless spells that do odd things. We still have a player character 
whose left leg below the knee looks and feels like metal, like a robot's 
leg. It feels normal to him, but he wonders why he clanks heavily on his 
left foot when he walks... (Again a dirty trick played by a nonhuman 
character who was wearing the guise of a human at the time)

About all I can do for now...

Regards,
Phil

{Moderator's Note:  Lisa Leutheuser asks about Princess Ma'in.             ]

>What is Princess Ma'in's birthday?

According to the Golden Book, Princess Ma'in Kruthai was born on 
the 24th of Drenggar, 2334 A. S. She herself disputes this. It 
would be impolite to press her -- or the priesthoods or her court 
scribes -- for more information. She perhaps wishes to be thought 
younger than she actually is -- a common feature of many societies, 
both here and on Tekumel. Youth = marriageability.

[                   Tekumel and in Tsolyanu specifically.  Phil answers and  ]
[                   then provides us even more "interesting" information.    ]

Most Tsolyani and others in the Five Empires do not practice cannibalism, 
even of the ritual, symbolic kind, such as Christians do on Sunday 
mornings when they consume wafers and wine as the "flesh and blood of 
Christ"). There are some sacrifices where priests and laity eat fruits 
and parts of sacrificial flowers as parts of rituals, but these are not 
considered to be stand-ins for human (or other) bodies or organs.

Most temples that sacrifice human beings (e.g. Vimuhla, Karakan) do not 
consume the bodies, although one ritual of Vimuhla includes dancing in 
the flayed skin of heroic warriors who have been sacrificed. The body 
itself is consumed in the Sacred Flame.Of the temples, only two have 
real cannibalism:

(1) Chiteng: in the ritual of the Gushing Forth of the Flame, performed
    annually at Chene Ho, Fasiltum, and a few other places, certain 
    classes of priests consume certain portions of their victims (as 
    many as 10 or 20 at a time) to increase their power. Hearts, male 
    sexual organs, biceps, and thigh muscles are roasted with spices 
    and served just like other dishes.  These dishes are not shared 
    with the laity, and the feast is held within the walls of the 
    temple and is accompanied by rhythmic, wailing music, cymbals, 
    drums, and clashing metal finger-rings. Special hymns are sung, 
    and youths ands maidens, nude except for orange-red body paint, 
    masked helmets, and other jewellery, dance wildly until they fall 
    down foaming at the mouth.

Bob asked me when this ceremony occurs. I add this information below:

Late summer: 18th of Halir, unless the green moon, Gayel, is full. 
Then it is postponed until the next new moon (Kashi).

(2) Hrihayal: the 33rd Aspect, named Nukher (accent on the "e,") who 
    is called Atalen (accent on the second "e") in the Inner Mysteries,
    is the patroness of both necrophilia and cannibalism. She is 
    described in the "Scroll of Kurritlen the Endurer" as a slim, pale, 
    sensuous girl with very long hair. She is portrayed as nude except 
    for bracelets and a collar of emeralds and silver. She has pointed, 
    razor-sharp teeth that are inlaid with emeralds or jade. She is 
    regularly worshipped in special shrines deep within the temples, 
    particularly those in Jakalla, Penom, and Katalal (yes, staid old 
    Katalal!) where only special devotees are allowed to attend her 
    ceremonies. During her orgies, it is said that she appears as a
    fearsome, alien creature, from whom her victims cannot flee. These 
    sacrifices are eaten alive, limb by limb, but it is said that they 
    perish in the throes of unendurable ecstasy. Her sacrifices are not 
    frequent, nor are they widely publicised.

Others in the Five empires may well have cannibalistic rites -- e.g. 
the Mad Ones of Hlikku in Yan Kor. The jungle tribes of Rannalu are 
rumoured to eat visitors, and the peoples of the deep jungles of 
M'morcha are known to consume the bodies of those slain by puff-
spiders, whose poison adds a delicate flavour that cannot be matched -- 
and is not then poisonous! 

Of the nonhumans, the Shen are widely famed for eating slaves, 
criminals, and even their own children, if they are naughty. You might 
read the article, "The Splendour of Shenyu," published in "The Tekumel 
Journal," no. 1, and republished in "The Best of the Journals I." I am 
reminded of a Shen official who visited a Tsolyani merchant's house in 
Shenyu. The host introduced his son, a boy of 10 or so and instructed 
him to "entertain our visitor and offer him some snacks" while he 
himself went off to see to the lunch. When he returned, the Tsolyani 
found the Shen munching on the last of the poor lad's bones and 
extracting the marrow! The Shen then remarked, "Your hospitality is far 
better than that offered by any other human. You may ask whatever 
commercial favours you wish. I shall see that they are granted!" 

[Moderator's Note:  This is Rich's initial question.                       ]
>I am interested in the Tsolyani attitude to cannibalism. In S&G

Most Tsolyani consider cannibalism highly distateful. It is not done 
in polite society, and only those who perform the rituals of the 
temples noted above engage in it. The Concordat protects those priests 
of Chiteng and Hrihayal whose doctrines require it. A person who ate 
another human for non-religious reasons would be shunned, and the clan 
of his victim would demand either his death or else much Shamtla 
(blood-money). If he continued this practice, his own clan would have 
him imprisoned or quietly slain. (This is a frequent method of dealing 
with those who commit "sex crimes," "perversions," etc. that are not 
religiously sanctioned.

To take another example, the practice of coprophagy (consumption of 
excrement) is forbidden, except in the rituals of another of Hrihayal's 
Aspects, Okokh the Consumer," described in "The Book of Slow 
Substances." Ritual priests of this Aspect are considered socially quite 
acceptable, except when performing their rituals in the shrine of their 
Aspect. A few noble devotees of Lady Hrihayal occasionally invite such 
priests to appear at their parties, but this is more to add a smidgin 
of sensationalism to their entertainments than out of religious zeal. 
Last year at the ceremony of Rejoicing Before the Seal, a troop of 
coprophages asked to perform their rituals, just as the servitors of 
other deities were to show theirs. Thus, the hierophants of Thumis 
sang their hymns; Hnalla's group created brilliant displays of light 
and dazzle; Karakan's warriors did a sword-dance with flashing blades; 
etc. -- and Hrihayal's little band displayed their predilections to all 
with predictable results...

Sounds a little like the islanders of the Naqsai coasts, far down

Most Tsolyani will react with distaste and avoidance, if not worse. 
The newcomers are not citizens and their rites and actions are not 
protected either by the Concordat or by Imperial law.  Immediate 
hostility may be evinced by anyone, thus, but only those whose 
friends and relations have been just been consumed may instantly call 
for the ultimate penalty.

Cultural diversity is so ingrained and widespread in Tsolyani society 
that one can get away with almost anything by saying "it's my 
religion." This is restricted largely to Tsolyani citizens and to 
those whose religious doctrines are ancient and familiar: i.e. the 
20 Deities of Pavar's pantheon. Thus, human sacrifices by devotees 
of Vimuhla and Karakan are politely not mentioned by worshippers of 
Thumis or Avanthe; but a strange deity whose followers are not 
Tsolyani is not likely to find such acceptance. 

I would thus suggest that your party might wish to travel to Shenyu 
and prepare both to eat and to be eaten. Otherwise, they must enter 
the priesthoods of Chiteng or Hrihayal, study and serve for some 
years, and then seek admittance to those sub-sects that enjoy rarer 
pastimes. Otherwise a speedy trip to the impaling stake probably 
awaits them.

Visitors to Tekumel are advised to avoid those practices that horrify
or disgust them. The society accepts a wide spectrum of diverse 
behaviour, and it is no more necessary for players to be exposed to 
perceived ugliness, cruelty, unfamiliar sexual practices, and violence 
than it is for every American to have to witness an execution, visit 
a brothel, join in a gang-rape in prison, use the services of a 
crack-house, etc. A game-master or referee can thus easily design 
a game in which almost all events and characters are well within the 
limits of American/European morality and permissibility. "No need to 
wallow in the muck," as the Tsolyani say about travelling to Haida 
Pakala.

Phil

There is no "second e" in "Atalen." Old age befogs the brain. Put the stress on 
the first (and *only*) "e."

------------------
Now, The Con News!

THE VERY GOOD NEWS
We made good progress with Tekumel-Con plans this past weekend.  After
weeks of trying to coordinate with the sales reps on our short list of
preferred hotels, we are now 98% certain that Tekumel-Con will be held 
at the Minneapolis Radisson Hotel South & Plaza Tower (but please don't 
call them yet).  I am 97% certain that we can have a contract signed by 
the end of the week.  As promised in the promotional materials, this is 
the kind of hotel that will add to, not detract from, your enjoyment of 
the convention.

THE SOMEWHAT GOOD NEWS
Contrary to previous indications, we are now rescheduling Tekumel-Con 
for Labor Day Weekend, August 29-31, 1997.

Some of you have contacted me about making travel plans early.  I am
sincerely sorry if this unexpected date change causes problems for any 
of you planning to attend.  We tried to keep the June 6-9 or 13-16 
weekends, but there were too many scheduling conflicts.  It seems so 
obvious now, but it turns out that June is a big wedding month.  I 
confess that I should have put more thought into the viability of a 
June date from the start.  Again, mea culpa, and my apologies.

THE POSITIVE SPIN ON THE DATE CHANGE
There are several benefits to the date change:
* I'm told the weather in Minneapolis is better in August than in June.
* I'm told that Labor Day Weekend is also Minnesota State Fair and
  Minnesota Renaissance Fair time, so there will be extra good things to do
  for those of you bringing family.
* Cost Savings!
  By going with Labor Day weekend, we can offer you a significantly
  cheaper room rate (expected to be $79/night).  We will also get a
  significant discount on the cost of the meeting rooms, allowing us
  to charge less for registration.

OTHER STUFF: SURVEY POSTCARDS
Have you all sent in your survey postcards?  Please do so if you haven't
yet.  Each response, even if you're telling me you can't attend, is
worthwhile.

TEKUMEL-CON NEEDS EVENTS
Once the hotel contract is signed, the first order of business will be to
do a mailing to all the survey respondents who indicated they would like to
run an event at the con.  A saintly few among you have already contacted me
and submitted event descriptions - thanks!  For the rest of you, please
start thinking about events you might like to run.  I will be contacting
you soon.  And of course, I'd always like to hear from new prospective GMs.


THE MODIFIED TEKUMEL-LARP
There was originally talk of a large Live-Action Tekumel game for the
convention.  While interest in this event was good, your survey results
indicated that you didn't think this was something that you would want us
to delay the con to prepare.

Given this, we are now planning a large 40+ player, 8+ hour long, Tekumel
board game, with LARP/role-play elements, as the centerpiece event of the
convention.

Here is the basic premise:
Players are one of five types:
* Clans (the majority of the players)
* Religious Leaders
* Political Leaders
* Military Leaders (the warring Princes)
* A few miscellaneous specials.

The game will consist of everyone embroiled in diplomacy, intrigue,
conspiracy, magical influence, economic co-dependence, and military
conflict.  All players will have set goals for victory, and nobody will be
able to win without lots of interaction with other players.

While not intended to portray Prof Barker's "real" Tekumel, the game will
definitely have a good Tekumelyani feel to it.

Well, that's just a teaser.  Watch for the pre-registration booklet for
more details.

[Moderator's Note:  Thomas Worthington asks about handling players who know ]
[                   or don't know too much about Tekumel.                   ]

>Just how much of the knowledge which players & player characters 
>have about Tekumel is known to the general public of Tsolyanu?

>For instance what level of society/education would be required to 
>know of the existence of Aircars, the tubeway system, Humanspace, 
>Ksarul's keys and wards, the Hokun, Urunen, Nom, The Black Ships, 
>the Jade Arch, The two Seals of the Imperium, the demon planes, 
>The Egg of the World, the artificial satellites, or to know that 
>Magic is not a "Godly" art but a technique which is a function of 
>Tekumel's plane?

This depends on the educational level and degree of sophistication an
individual has. Urban merchants, for example, are likely to know how 
to read. If they have attended a temple school, they will have heard of 
aircars and tubeway cars, though mostly as "locker-room tall tales."  
Interdimensional theory and practice are reserved for students of the 
higher levels of the temple academies, and even this is mostly patchwork. 
Opening nexus points is restricted mostly to senior students of the 
scholarly branches of the temples, but a lot of city people know that 
this can be done, much as I know that open heart surgery is being 
performed, but I don't have a clue how one does it.
 
Matters such as Humanspace, the Nom, the Hokun, the Black Ships, 
artificial satellites, etc. are much less known. The general 
populace may have heard vague rumours of some of these, but have no 
real knowledge. There are, however, lots of superstitions, tall tales, 
travellers' fables, chicanery, and sheer nonsense which everybody knows.

People tell me the world is round, but I do not have the astronomical 
knowledge or skills to demonstrate this to anybody. I recall once in 
the deserts of Baluchistan some people pooh-poohed this idea and said 
that I ought not to tell silly tales like this unless I could prove 
them. Acording to Islamic tradition, they said, the earth is flat, with 
paradises layered above it. I later discovered that the Qur'an does 
*not* say this but has a much wider point of view than the Bible does. 
At the time, I was quite helpless to give demonstrable reasons for the 
idea that the world is round. Maybe it isn't, really ... :-)

The Jade Arch and the Seals of the Imperium are more widely known. They 
are taught as doctrine in every academy and school in the Empire. 
Kasrul's Keys and Wards are known as legends, and the Temple of Ksarul 
teaches a sort of catechism about them that most young worshippers know. 
This has spread to students of other deities as well, although the 
details are fuzzy and full of inaccuracies.

The Egg of the World is just a legend to most folk. Few believe in its 
reality. Few people believe in the physical existence of the Undying 
Wizards (Thomar, Subadim, etc.) Very few have heard of the College at 
the End of Time. After all, who could take such old fables seriously?

Magic and the Gods exist; no one really knows their true nature. The 
reasons why magic works are known to a small number of scholars. The 
academies teach various levels of "theoretical" courses, which contain 
some truth and some conjecture -- rather like this world...

Rural people, peasants, lower class city folk, inhabitants of remote 
nations, etc. are all less aware of these things to greater or lesser 
degrees. One cannot walk into a village in Tsolyanu and start chatting 
about tubeway cards and other-planar travel, for example. In remote 
Rannalu, you would be lucky if anybody would even listen to you! The 
sun is the Eye of a wrathful god in some locales, while the moon is the 
same eye but asleep.

You are almost correct, as said above. The new rules deal with things 
most Tekumelani do not know. "Gardasiyal" is for the referee; players 
must pretend ignorance -- just as a player in an ancient Roman game 
must pretend that he is not aware of the circulation of the blood.

It is distantly possible that he might be familiar with tubeway 
stations. He might have heard vague fables about the Unstraightened 
City -- "There be Dragonnes there" -- but he would not have any real 
knowledge of any of this.

Most players *still* do not know much about the *real* secrets of 
Tekumel. I let everybody find things out slowly -- with lots of red 
herrings along the way.

They try hard. Some keep saying, "I could tell you, but I am nothing 
but an illiterate warrior" (or what-have-you). They frequently step 
outside of the game in order to discuss a new item of theoretical 
interest. I also stop and listen, add hints, etc. but I don't run all 
the screts past people like a general giving a briefing.

It is hard to spell out something that has no clear fixed boundaries 
or demarcation lines. Yes, matrilineal (etc.) power lies largely in 
the north, including parts of northern Tsolyanu: Chene Ho, Si'is, 
Thri'il, Aukesha, and over near to Fasiltum (where male dominance is 
more pervasive). Matrilineal supremacy is powerful in the farther 
north: Yan Kor, Milumanaya, and over into Sa'a Allaqi. In Ghaton, on 
the other hand, a woman is lucky to be kept in a stable and fed slop! 
The Yan Koryani consider this practice as barbarous as do the Tsolyani.

There is thus a delicate shading from South to North -- not a clear-cut 
frontier. Some clanhouses in Khirgar are traditionally run by older 
women, as in Yan Kor; others are male-dominated; still others have 
"in-between" structures. It is very hard to be more precise without 
some serious anthropological fieldwork of the sort one might expect 
of American/European researchers. I have tended to make broad 
generalisations in the context of a game, where players' interest and 
the number of pages one can publish are both limited.

All of this is true, although there are significant mitigating factors 
as well. A non-Aridani woman may still have influence through her 
relatives, just as women do in some strata of both Hindu and Muslim 
India. Having lived much of my adult life in a marriage with a lovely 
lady from eastern India, I can tell you categorically that female 
subservience just ain't what it's knocked up to be! 

>It's also explicitly stated that prejudice exists against Aridani as

>"traditional-minded"? <G> 

Not everyone, by any means! Some males prefer a less active role; 
others see benefits in having a wife who holds a good job, who is 
active in civic/political affairs, and who is often better educated 
than a non-Aridani partner.

>Given that "[b]etrothals are often finalized

This sometimes *does* happen, certainly. It also happens that a 
childhood-arranged betrothal breaks down for other reasons. But in a 
society in which people are less individualistic and more group-minded, 
it also happens that neither the future bride or the groom has any real 
feelings about the marriage, and similar education and upbringing 
produce mates who are mutually substituable. So, if Miss A goes off, 
becomes an Aridani, and joins the army, Miss B, her clan-sister may be 
just as suitable as a prospective wife. The concept of single-minded 
monogamous "love" is less common in Tsolyanu. Husbands and wives often 
live in larger joint-family (clan) arrangements, where both partners 
have access to friends of their own preference, to older and younger 
relatives, and to other mates (which is not much frowned upon). Where 
an American/European is expected (ideally, anyway!) to maintain a 
monogamous relationship and where the partners must fulfill many 
roles -- mother/father, brother/sister, business colleague, sports 
colleague, hobby-colleague, etc., the Tsolyani family group provides 
separate persons within the same household to fulfill certain of these 
roles. This takes some of the pressure off of the individual: e.g. if 
a person is great in bed and good at family care, he/she may not be 
good at all in keeping up with the sports interests of his/her mate. A 
lack of shared interests here may be a cause for alienation and 
eventual divorce, whereas on Tekumel the sports-minded spouse can get 
support and companionship from others in the clan, while enjoying the 
non-sports-minded spouse's other talents. 

>The description of Aridanification sounds as though an Aridani is accorded
>explicitly male status:  "A female has only to declare before witnesses

This is all true. No one can deny that males take precedence in 
Tsolyani society. As in many cultures, however, there are degrees of 
interpretation and other circumstances that make a simple 
characterisation rather less than useful.

>It's also mentioned, though, that it is "uncommon to find even senior

Again, true. So Gloria Steinem and Germaine Greer might not be happy 
campers on Tekumel. I have never argued that Tekumel is (or should be) 
"politically correct." It is considerably *more* politically correct 
than mediaeval European society (remember chastity belts?), or Japanese 
society, or various others -- but this is all irrelevant to Tekumel. Do 
I sense a constant desire in some quarters to cast Tekumel (and other 
games, books, movies, etc.) in one's own terms and apply one's own 
societal standards to things for which they were never intended?

>On the other hand, a whopping 15-20% of the Tsolyanu's women are estimated

All of what you say is true. The usual reason given by the Tsolyani, 
however, is that an Aridani woman can attain a more prestigious job that 
pays better and offers more opportunities to influence matters for her 
clan. Since wealthier people tend to have servants and/or slaves, the 
fact that an Aridani woman goes off to work does not materially affect 
cooking, housekeeping, child-rearing, and other tasks.

>Anyway, what I mean to be saying with all this is that I personally find it
>difficult to believe that there is *not* prejudice in Tsolyanu against

You are probably correct here, at least to some extent. *Overt* 
prejudice is quite uncommon, but there is almost certainly a sense 
of "difference" between males and Aridani women, with some prejudice 
to the latter.

>I sort of imagine Aridani status to be like "religious freedom" in the

>religious intolerance.

I know what you mean, being myself a member of a different faith. Even 
so, I doubt whether prejudice against Aridani women on Tekumel is as 
strong, as overt, and as difficult to overcome as was the case, for 
example, between Protestant Christians and Jews in earlier times in the 
United States. It may be more like the prejudice once held by "nice 
people" against unmarried mothers earlier in this century in the United 
States. Male supremacy there certainly is -- your "glass ceiling," for 
example -- but I cannot recall a case of violence or even really nasty 
words spoken against an Aridani woman.

>In the version of Tekumel I played in and GMed in, Aridani status was
>considerably less common (no more than 5-10% of the female population of
>Tsolyanu), tended to be found more in urban areas and among "middle-class"

I'll agree to your statement that Aridani status is more common in urban 
areas and middle or higher class society. I am not sure of the exact 
percentage of Aridani versus non-Aridani women, nor am I very certain 
about a "lifetime commitment." It *is* a lifetime commitment for many 
Aridani, but there are some who seem to tire of it and drift back into 
traditional non-Aridani roles. 

Your perception is just as good as mine here. These matters are complex 
and wide open to interpretation. They change from person to person, 
clan to clan, place to place, and time to time. I thus tend to say, 
"It's your Kaitar... Spend it or save it, as you will!"

Phil

Expanding on this theme, I can recall other mentions of cannibalism in the
Five Empires:

1) In "A Merchant's Tale" (in JTA #2 I think) the narrator is offered a
tidbit of Yan Koryani heart by his new Nlyss friends.

2) The rituals Tsa'avtulgu's patron Black Qarqa are said to encompass
homophagy.

3) In "Flamsong" Prince Ridek and his fellow POWs fear being fed to the
Sarku worshipping troops beseiging Pu'er. (With Dhich'une now emporer is
this likely to become standard field rations for the Tsolyani army?)
  
On another subject, I got Hammerton's "Wonders of the Past" this evening
through inter library loan. Though a bit out of date in spots (e.g.
Piltdown Man mentioned other than as a hoax) overall its great! Thanks

I read the posting about cannibalism on Tekumel with great interest.
Although the topic is rather (OK, very) grisly, there is something
fascinating about it. I have occasionally used cannibalism in some of my
adventures, and I think it is often considered a mark of a "barbaric"
culture. 

I seem to recall that cannibalism (as well as necrophilia!) is a part of the
cult practices of Black Qarqa in Salarvya. Am I wrong in assuming that at
least one of the Shadow Gods of Livyanu also incorporates this practice into
their ritual (assuming that it may only pertain to a specific aspect as with
Chiteng and Hrihayal)? Is any of this info likely to be covered in
_Mitlanyal_, or is TOME likely to consider it too risque/over-the-top?
(Considering the reputation FRPGs have in some quarters of society, I would
understand their concern -- even though I feel it is unfounded.)

About the appropriateness of gift giving:

Gift-giving is rather different in Tsolyanu than it is here on Terra. 
The person who is higher in clan, wealth, and/or position may distribute 
gifts to "lower" persons as a way of displaying his/her power and 
prestige. The lower person may respond with thanks and humble obeisance --
but does not necessarily have to respond with a gift in kind. This is 
especially true of people whose social differences are very wide, such 
as an Imperial Princess versus a non-Imperial (no matter how high in 
clan,etc.) It is considered "noble" for a noble to hand out expensive 
gifts; the lower person replies with thanks, by composing a poem in 
the noble's honour, by giving the noble something unique that the noble 
may desire (i.e. not just a box of chocolates or a striped tie!).

In many cases it would be considered downright presumptious for a lower 
person even to offer a gift: rather like me sending a box of candy to 
Rockefeller or Trump! Instead of showing "class," this would probably 
be interpreted as "cheek."

Among social equals, gifts are indeed appropriate. A small and unique 
token of esteem is quite proper between people whose clans are fairly 
close together, or who share the a similar business or political level. 
Even here, a polite note, beautifully calligraphed by a professional 
artist-scribe, would be seen as very suitable. 

One does give gifts to family members on their birthdays and other 
occasions. These do not have to large or expensive, but they must show 
taste. You can't just hand somebody a printed card and a box of poor-
quality candy -- unless you both belong the same rather low social 
level. One must use one's imagination and knowledge of the recipient's 
tastes and interests. A box of flannel shorts would not be much 
welcomed by a clan-brother or father, whereas a tiny clay statue of a 
dancing frog might be much admired by one whose interests ran to 
collecting antiques.

Play by ear. Don't be ostentatious. Think of the other party's actual 
likes and dislikes. Since there are few holidays when everybody in the 
society feels it incumbent to offer gifts (like Terran Christmas), you 
can take your time and relax -- no last minute Christmas shopping for 
60 people!

Phil

There is not a lot of information. I have never really explored Ssu or 
Hluss culture because the critters are so bitterly hostile. They are 
not *close* relatives, that's for sure. They are not as close as humans 
and gorillas or chimapnzees, for instance. They *may* be as close as 
humans and dolphins -- I just don't know. I am not a zoologist and hence 
have only the common man's knowledge of this sort of topic.

There are apparently relations between the Ssu and the Hluss, although 
no human knows just how much. It is said that the Ssu have 
representatives on the big Hluss island, and there may well be Hluss in 
Ssuyal. They have been seen to cooperate with one another when they meet 
outside of their separate enclaves, but instances of this are rather few. 
It is hard to say.

It is indeed clear that these two species do not speak the same 
"language," nor do they mate or share various other relationships.

Not much help. Sorry!

[Moderator's Note:  The following campaign idea comes from Delbert Jackson.  ]

[                   to answer Phil.  I can only guess that He Who Has No Tail]

[                   Bindings, or are we talking of something else?           ]

It was suggested to me that I should submit this to the Blueroom.  
This is my first submission, so I hope this is the type of thing that 
you accept.  Here are the two things that I would like you to 
consider. 

Do you know any information about The Ruins of N'gala, (near  Jakalla)?

Do you know anything about "He Who Has No Tail"?
I was thinking to have an adventure based on "He Who Has No Tail". 
The original rule book said "the curious city of Hmakuyal (hex  
3708)  where dwells He Who Has No Tail, the subject of many ancient
and terrible legends;"

>Seems like he/she/it formed the Milumanayanan Desert and might've had 
>something to do with Hrugga and the Egg of the World.

The way it would start is by one of the players eating a basketball
looking jello like fruit/egg.  Once it's cut anyone who smells it
can't keep from tasting it or stop eating it once they start.

(The smell of a damaged egg has to be rolled against or the
victim will have to have a taste.  Once it's cut/damaged anyone who
smells it can't keep from eating it, unless they are 'final stage'.)

This would cause the eater to be transformed into a tadpole looking 
creature.  At this point if they 'Remove Curse' they  can regain 
their form.  Otherwise the person has an addiction that requires
them to eat  some of an egg at least once a month and even with 
remove curse they  are unable to talk about anything having to do 
with "HWHNT".  This is a very strong mind bar. Afterwards some robed  
priests come to 'transport'  them to the Temple of He Who Has No 
Tail.  At the temple the player is dumped into one of the many canals 
within the temple complex.  The smell of more eggs will draw them 
into the main pool.  After they eat another entire egg they will regrow arms. 
At this main pool is "He Who Has No Tail".  At random times once
 a week the statue of "HWHNT" will fill with "HWHNT"s spirit and it
will leap into the pool and eat a worshiper.  After eating a 
worshiper "HWHNT" will lay more eggs and return to statue form. 
After an entire third egg is eaten the player will regrow legs. 
During this time they can't resist the smell of the eggs.  After the
fourth egg they lose their tail and can leave the temple.  The
player still has the addiction that requires them to eat an egg at 
least once a month and they are still unable to talk about anything 
having to do with "HWHNT".  This is a very very strong mind bar.  If  
they don't recruit new 'worshipers' then when they go back to eat an 
egg  they will eventually be caught and eaten themselves.  The more
worshipers there are the less chance you will be the one eaten 
however, the less eggs will be available to be eaten.  If an egg is 
not eaten the person will lose a hit point a week permanently until 
an egg is eaten, at which time they will heal normally.
The final stage victim can transport back into the main pool at any 
time, from any distance, while bringing anything mansized or less 
that is not metal.

[Moderator's Note:  Once a month seems a bit excessive to me.                 ]

"He Who Has No Tail"  can't be harmed on this plane!
 
This idea would lock players into a plot that would drive them throughout the 
game.  I'm not sure the ability to always transport to the temple 
would make them feel better.  But, always having a way to bailout of 
a bad situation could be very valuable.

> As long as HWHNT ain't at home.  

So don't take fruit from a stranger!

The convention date has now been finalized; it will be on Labor Day
weekend, AUGUST 29-31, 1997.  Please note the difference from the target
date of June 6-9 that we previously announced.  We apologize if this causes
you any inconvenience.


COSTS
We have contracted with the Radisson South, in Minneapolis, to provide
rooms and meeting space for the con.  As promised in the previous
announcements, this is a hotel that will add to, not detract from, your
enjoyment of the convention.  We're also getting a better deal by holding
the con on Labor Day weekend (a big part of the reason for the date
change).  Rooms are $79 (plus 12.5% taxes - ouch) per night.  Full booking
information will be released with the pre-registration booklet.

Registration fees for the convention will be $50 for the weekend.  There
will be no separate event fees.

We are prepared to offer a GM discount of $15 per event that you run, with
a maximum discount of $30.  However, we are asking that you consider
waiving this discount.  To be honest, our financial projections at this
point show us taking over a $1,000 loss.  If you are able to waive the
discount, it would help.  In return we'll make this promise: if we end up
making more money than expected, Gamemasters will be refunded the GM
discount after the con.  We're taking steps to keep costs down, but none
that will prevent Tekumel-Con from being one of the best convention
experiences you'll ever have.

We're offering a similar deal to people who submit Tekumel-related artwork:
$15 per piece that we end up using, even if you don't attend the
convention.  As with GMs, you have the option of waiving this payment.

To top it off, all GMs, artists and volunteers will get a free copy of the
post-convention booklet.  This will contain transcripts of the seminar
discussions, and any other goodies we can dig up.  We'll charge non-
volunteers around $15 for this book.


EVENT DESCRIPTIONS
Please find below a slightly revised Event Description Form.  Please copy
it as many times as necessary and submit one for each event you'd like to
run.  If it's easier for you, you don't need to use this specific form.
When submitting events, please be sure to include all the relevant
information requested on the form.

EVENT DESCRIPTION DEADLINE
It may be asking a lot, but please try to get your event descriptions to
David Cheng by FRIDAY, MARCH 28th.  Here's the reason for such an early
deadline: without events, we don't have a convention.  If we need to cancel
the convention because of lack of events (worst-case scenario), we need to
notify the hotel by April 1st.  After this date we get hit with a big
cancellation fee.

We'd also like to get the pre-registration booklet produced in early April,
for mailing in late April.  Having your event descriptions by the end of
March makes this possible.

Please contact David Cheng, by whatever means necessary, if you want to run
an event, but can't submit the event description by March 28th.  If you're
not absolutely sure you can attend the con, but you're going to try, we'd
suggest submitting your event descriptions now anyway.

QUESTIONS?
Please contact David Cheng with any questions you might have:
(212) 472-7752    Home, until midnight EST
(212) 769-5317    Work (it's better to call me at home, however)
cheng@io.com      Email

Thank you for your willingness to help us organize Tekumel-Con.  We look
forward to your event descriptions and artwork!

Sincerely,

David Cheng
Tekumel-Con Chair

[Moderator's Note:  Kenji Schwarz follows up on the reply to his message    ]
[                   about Aridani status.                                   ]

Following up (belatedly) on Professor Barker's explanation of Aridani
status and related issues:

[I suggested that declaration of Aridani status may disrupt pre-arranged
marriage agreements, and cause some (probably minor) troubles for the
bride's family; the Professor responded:]

>This sometimes *does* happen, certainly. It also happens that a
>childhood-arranged betrothal breaks down for other reasons. But in a
>society in which people are less individualistic and more group-minded,
>it also happens that neither the future bride or the groom has any real
>feelings about the marriage, and similar education and upbringing
>produce mates who are mutually substituable. So, if Miss A goes off,
>becomes an Aridani, and joins the army, Miss B, her clan-sister may be
>just as suitable as a prospective wife.

This raises another question, in my mind.  I'm guessing that the kinship
grouping that is the most important in day-to-day life and domestic affairs
is an extended family of some sort -- a fragment or faction of the overall
clan, in any case.  Most marriages are, after all, within a single clan;
there must be some sub-unit or sub-structure that one belongs to for
purposes of marriage, inheritance, patronage, etc.  So, are these "extended
families" or "clan branches" normally large enough, in any given community,
to provide adequate numbers of heirs? of marriage partners?  I'm wondering
what sort of pressure there might be on an individual to marry a certain
person, for example, or to produce a son/daughter to perpetuate the
(sub-)lineage, etc.  Is it rare for there to be a lack of alternate
brides/grooms/parents, or does this sort of thing happen fairly often?

In game terms, at least, it seems to me that "parental" (in the loose sense
of the term) pressure could be brought to bear on hapless players more
often -- and _should_ be brought to bear on them -- on familial matters.
Usually one only encounters clan pressure on a larger and wider scale, with
regard to some public and political intrigue or concern that the PC gets
tangled up in...  Tekumel needs more familial oppression!  Nagging parents
make for good gaming! <G>

Yes, I agree completely, and didn't intend to arrange those quotes so as to
create a simplistic characterization.  I am still wondering, though, how
Aridani status is conceived of by the Tsolyani -- is it thought of as
"being symbolically/socially male," or "being a special, third gender
category distinct from both male and female gender roles," or yet something
else...?

[snip]

>>It's also mentioned, though, that it is "uncommon to find even senior

>>there's a "glass ceiling" for Aridani women even in the only semi-public

Whoa, whoa!  I think you might be reading more into my questions and ideas
than I intended.  In some respects, I think Tekumel is a little *too* PC
for my own personal taste.  The level of religious tolerance, (optional)
gender equality, sexual freedom, relative lack of nationalism,
individualistic ethic of "noble action," and so forth all add to Tekumel's
unique character, and make it an even more interesting place.  It's just
that I can't help wondering whether in gaming practice, these
characteristics I mention don't become simplistic vehicles for the
id-gratification of late 20th-century Western(ized) hobbyists... myself
included.  Without understanding what religious freedom means in Tsolyani
terms, for example, it's hard for players and GMs to avoid importing those
inappropriate societal standards of their own which you mention.

Hope I'm neither offending nor boring anyone with this thread...
