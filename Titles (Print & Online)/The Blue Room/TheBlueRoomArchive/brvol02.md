These messages are the accumulation of the messages that were sent out on 
the Blue Room email list between May 1995 and June 2000.  A large portion 
of the information is directly from Professor M.A.R Barker. When the list 
members joined during the time the list was active, they agreed to refrain 
from sharing this data with non list members.  When the list ended, it was 
urged that the data be made available to non-list Tekumel fans, and it 
seemed like a good idea all around.

I only ask that if you download these digests, or have received them in 
some other way, please respect the agreements the list members made, and 
refrain from passing them around and instead point people to the Tekumel 
web site, www.tekumel.com so that they can download them for themselves, 
and see all the other material available on the Tekumel.com web site.

Many Thanks.

[Moderator's Note:  Dermot Bolton asks the following 2 questions and     ]
[                   Professor Barker responds.                           ]

>With regard to old Tombs.  When I first started playing Tekumel some six 
>years ago it was with a group archaeologist friends of mine.  The thing that 
>hit us the most when we visited out first underworld was how well preserved 
>it all was for something that was over 20,000 years old.

My player characters often find materials too decayed to identify, much less 
use. The Underworlds also vary from VERY dry (as in ancient Egyp) around 
Khirgar, to soggy and totally mildewed (around Penom). My players have found 
sections of important "Tsu'urum" completely underwater -- and others preserved 
by the climatisation devices of the great Ancients still okay after 60,000 
years. I realise this is rather unlikely, but I became bored with the very short
"antiquity" one finds in Europe ("Gosh, Martha, it's almost a hundred years 
old!"), and hence I rook recourse to the science and climatisation expertise of 
Tekumel's long scientific past. Of course, this cannot apply to the Engsvanyali 
or to the Tlakotani Second Imperium -- they came long after the Great Ancients, 
the Latter Times, etc. etc. were all dead and buried -- but in my own campaigns 
I make allowances for this. Coins, stones, gold, and a few other uncorrodable 
materials are all that is likely to remain. "Magic" can be applied, of course, 
to make things last longer (cf. the relevant Thumis spell for books). 

>The problem is that there is no archaeological precedent for sites of 
>this age and degree of civilisation.  Initially we found this a little 
>disturbing but soon carried on with the game regardless and began a long and 
>enjoyable campaign that still lives today.

Glad you ignored the problem. These great ages are meant only to give players a 
sense of real antiquity. With sorcery, a dry climate, and lots of luck, the 
contents of the Tsu'urumyal can be made to last. After all, Tekumel IS a 
fantasy...

>My question is what sort of decay can Tsolyani 'archaeologists' ,aka Tomb 
>robbers with a license, expect in tombs from the times of darkness through 
>to early second imperium?  Were the standards of construction better in the 
>earlier civilisations?

The late Engsvanyali through early Second Imperium remains are the most likely 
to have decayed. I have had players touch beautiful chests, woodcarvings, etc. 
and seen them slump into piles of dust. The earlier Engsvanyali stuff is more 
durable (some of the techniques of the Latter Times seem to have been 
maintained), while the Bednalljans have left largely stones, gold (and other 
metals that do not decay, either naturally or by sorcery), books written on 
leaves of gold, etc. The Llyani and the Three States of the Triangle have left 
almost nothing but stones, coins, gems, and fallen monuments.

>The other problem is with artifacts.  Except in all but the driest and best 
>sealed of chambers I would expect a high degree of decay of any steel or 
>organic goods.  Any ancient writings would have long gone unless inscibed on 
>stone or blessed by the preserver of wisdom.  Pottery would remain (just 
>your field Chris) but bodies would instantly crumble to dust if disturbed.

You are absolutely right. Iron and untreated steel appear as heaps of corrosion.
Only magic can preserve it. Almost all organic goods simply fall to dust and 
blow away. Chlen-hide becomes large blackish flakes and disappears. Pottery and 
magically protected artifacts are another story. Bodies fall to dust, unless 
protected by some spell, cloth and paper are instant goners when the tomb is 
opened! I am afraid that the "game" tends to obscure this "reality."

>My point is that GM's often don't realise the full implication of 20,000yrs 
>+.  In a recent article in Scientific American on the Mesopotamian city of 
>Mashkan-shapir it explains how little is left of a city that has been 
>relatively untouched, after only four thousand years.  Just how rare are

You are quite right. The referee must make allowances for decay and the passage 
of time.

This is deliberate on the part of the Tlakotani. In Avanthar the great Book of 
Deeds contains all of these early facts, but no one is permitted to consult it. 
The Tlakotanis are very sly and secretive about their origins. Somewhere in the 
north, it is supposed, since the Petal Throne itself comes from Malchairan in 
N'luss, according to legend. Not much more is known -- publicly.

>My question is, during the time of no kings just who were the Tlakotani, 
>where were they from and how did the first Emperor unite the lands to become 
>one?  And what was the name of the first Tlakotani?

All questions that will only gain you a trip to the Ultimate Labyrinth if asked 
too loudly... The honour of the Dynasty demands respect -- and a goodly amount 
of silence. Someday I will try to tell this tale -- in a place where the 
Tlakotani cannot see it and take revenge.

[Moderator's Note:  Bob Dushay responds to Phil McGreggor's Chlen Hide ]
[                   article.                                           ]

Phil, your solution to the riddle of Chlen-hide is brilliant!  However,
I have a different idea in mind, more in line with the Professor's 
original concept as described in the books.  I should also add that the
Professor told me that the Ssu used Chlen hide before humans came to
Tekumel, obtaining it by trade.  This means that the Chlen-beast could not
have been genetically engineered just for Tekumel after the Time of
Darkness.
   I always envisioned the Chlen-beast as having a hide more akin to a
chitinous shell than leather.  The tanners peel off large sheets of the
shell, soften it in a chemical process, molds and cuts it, and then re-
hardens it in another process.  I am not a chemist either, and I don't 
know if this is physically possible, but it works for me.  I would guess
the chemical composition of the shell would either include silica (from
the grasses the Chlen eats) or possibly other minerals locked in a semi-
flexible molecule; possibly its structure could be like bone, with a mix
of the flexible protein collagen, and the stiff crystalline apatite.
Apatite can be dissolved by acid, leaving only a soft, rubbery "bone" 
that looked like the original, but was only made of collagen.  Bend, cut,
mold and form this collagen into the desired shape, and then use a
different chemical process to re-"plate" the collagen with apatite or even
another mineral to stiffen it.
   Without a sample of the actual hide to test, we may be unable to
test which of our theories is more fitting.

The Ssu and Hluss seem to have had acces to the Chlen before humans arrived 
on Tekumel. The original beast seems to have been native to the Pe Choi 
worlds, and there must have been interstellar trade of some sort back then.

No idea. I wish I knew more chemistry! The stuff is not really "shell-like" 
or "chitinous" in feel -- rather more like thick layers of calloused "skin."
These peel off in sheets of varying thickness. They are quite unlike the 
Ssu integument which "unrolls" like a paper towel from a roll, all soft 
and flexible and smelling of something like cinnamon. As far as I know, 
nobody has ever found a use for Ssu-hide or been able to tan it.

Since I can't provide any Chlen-hide at the moment, we're rather at a loss 
for a solution to this discussion.

[Moderator's Note:  Bob Dushay asks some questions about the White Crystal ]
		    clan in Jakalla.                                       ]

>Professor, I am preparing a second campaign to introduce beginners to
>Tekumel to the game.  I am starting in Jakalla (as so many others do), and
>I have selected the Clan of the White Crystal as my starting point because

>1. Who is the Clan Head in Jakalla, and what is he like?  I had selected
>Neqo hiArsanmra, because in spite of his unimpressive height and impressive
>girth, he is a mellifluous speaker and a skillful politician, but I could be
>wrong about his status.

You have the right man. Neqo hiArsanmra is still clanmaster. He's a tough old 
bird, but he has helped the clan prosper, in spite of the civil war -- or 
perhaps because of it since he has sold grain and hides and other supplies to 
Prince Eselne, to Prince Rereshqala, and to the Imperium.

>2. What are the origins of the clan?  How old is it, and what is known about
>   when and where it was founded?  What were its early members known for?

Supposedly Engsvanyali, like its "parent," the Clan of the White Stone, it 
is one of the agricultural clans of the Engsvanyali Empire. Its members 
often became local officials, and now it is famous for its numerous 
bureaucrats all across the Empire. No one knows when it was founded, but 
it is supposed to have been during early Engsvanyali times somewhere near 
Jakalla or north along the River.

>3. Is there a lineage that is considered "unpleasant" or difficult by most

Qolyelmu is usually a lineage name and not a personal name. Try Vurosa 
hiTukun, who is more like the sort of businessman you want. He is clever, 
rather dishonest, and tremendously wealthy and influential. The Tukun 
lineage is said to date back to a hero of Dormoron Plain, but this is a 
fiction: it is probably no older than late Ensgvanyali times.

The map of Jakalla never did have a scale, and hence the big buildings are 
MUCH too big, and the smaller houses, shops, etc. are much too small and 
constricted.  The map should be redrawn, but who has time or energy? Most 
of the clans have lands around Jakalla anyway, and clanmembers tend to live 
outside of the city on their own lands, rather than cramp the clanhouse in 
town. The noble dead are indeed buried in mausolea underneath certain sites 
in the City of the Dead. Many of the minor clansfolk are buried in lesser 
graves in small graveyards on the clan lands, and some of the really minor 
-- slaves, labourers, etc. are just put into the ground with no rites or 
grave goods. In a couple of years the incsects do their work, and the "grave" 
can be used again for somebody else. All of the high clans do NOT bury their 
dead in one mausoleum, of course: each has an entrance that leads to its own
burial sites. The map is, as I said, badly skewed and constricted and should 
be extended to fit some reasonable scale. I drew it long ago when I was 
still working with Tsolyani concepts of drawing pictures instead of real 
mapping. They never discovered "scale" but made the more important 
buildings larger and the minor ones smaller or non-existent.

The gate you refer to is called "The Gate of Bones" by some of the lower 
classes. Its proper name is "The High Gate of Chaimaktel." She was the 
mistress of Ssirandar I. The name is doubtless apocryphal -- the gate 
wasn't built until the last Ditlana -- about 800 years ago.

I'm going to try to enclose a Filemaker Pro file of White Crystal clansmen 
in my lists. You will need Filemaker Pro to open and use it. I am sure 
you can get a copy somewhere -- it's a good database.

[Moderator's Note:  Floyd Brigdon sends the following.                 ]
To the Luminaries of the Assembled List:

     I have recently been preparing to begin a Tekumel campaign and, in
reading articles about starting up (both in >The Eye< and online) I have
heard it mentioned several times that it is a good idea to begin the
characters as barbarians or refugees, characters unfamiliar with Tsolyani in
general. 
     From your collective experience, how important do you think this is? I
would appreciate any advice or suggestions that you might provide.

[                   the Professor and one of our list members, Alexander   ]

[                   basic roadmap for the message.                         ]

Here's your Zna'ye question answered (from my previous letter):

MARB: I have become much more involved with the Pariah Deities, and I have 
produced a booklet on the language used by their hierarchy, called Sunuz. I hope
it can be published one day. I have also done a Livyani grammar and script, and 
a Yan Koryani grammar to go with Bill Faulkner's handsome Yan Koryani script. I 
redid his Tsolyani script and also tried (poorly) a Salarvyani font. It was so 
complicated that I could never master it. 

Alex: I found the reference in the new character generation rules to Zna'ye (the
language of She Who Must Not Be Named) very intriguing. It is almost a
cognate (serbian 'j' is pronounced like 'y') for the slavic 'znanje' --
meaning knowledge or learning. Hmm... secret knowledge/language - I like
that

MARB: I never did a Zna'ye grammar. I don't think the Goddess would approve...

I hope to get out more of the Pariah Deities' scripts and history, now that 
Sunuz is finished. But I am getting too old and decrepit to write very much. (I 
am now retired on physical disability.)  I'll see about getting the Sunuz 
article out, though.

[Moderator's Note:  The Professor has an article on Sunuz he is shopping   ]
[around to publishers.  Stay tuned here for information concerning its     ]	
[release.                                                                  ]

Alex: talking about words in Tekumel languages that appear to e borrowed from 
Terran sources: Sort of like the korun-koran cognate in Tsolyani and Arabic!

MARB:Really? I never thought of them as cognates. How perceptive you are!

Alex: What degree of syntactic "connection" is there between the languages used 
by followers of the Pariah Deities: Sunuz, Zna'ye, etc.? (Shared syntactic 
constructions)

MARB: Quite a lot, but these languages are not linguistically related -- only 
through shared theological views.

Alex: Did the worshippers of the Pariah Dieties act in collaboration to
one another?

MARB: Not very much. Some.

Alex: Did this affect the development of shared cyphers, dialects, codes, etc?

MARB: Not really. Their temples are very secretive.

Alex: Has historical transformation of these languages, which are all classed as
Ancient, led to a situation where the original syntactic
correlations have all but been obliterated?

MARB: No. Your linguistic questions are too technical to go into here. I will 
look at them later, I hope. Sunuz has no tones, but the Ai Che group does. They 
are probably not historically related but only share the same interest in the 
Pariah Deities. Zna'ye has tones, also.

Alex: Are classifiers and/or particles used (I like to think that they 
are!)?

MARB: Yes. Sunuz has classifiers, too.

Alex: What sort of structures exist for expressing temporal events? Is Zna'ye 
radically different in its treatment of temporal relationships from the Khishan-
family languages?

MARB: Not really -- until you get into the substructure of the linguistic world-
view.

Alex: I have always personally speculated that several of the Shadow Gods, I 
should say "aspects" of them, are really  heavily "water-downed" images of some/
all of the Pariah Dieties? A cthnonic-substratum of the modern Livyani pantheon?
I like to believe that some of the Pariah-languages (to use a shorthand) were 
philologically related to more "well known" languages such as Ancient Livyani 
(which I hope is Duru'ob -- I am hacking this out at the  office over lunch -- 
so I cannot be certain). What is your opinion on this?

You may be right. I can't get to specifics on this without writing a book!

[Moderator's Note:  Another short topic from the conversations of Alex and ]
[                   Professor Barker, covering creation of short sketches  ]
[                   of the remaining Tekumelani languages.                 ]

Alex wants to do short sketches of various languages.

I'd love to do this. I can only hope to find the energy and willpower to do 
these thumbnail sketches. Engsvanyali is troublesome because there ARE 
a number of book titles, names, and the short text in the Book of Ebon Bindings 
in this language, and it would take me a while to scrounge up my notes and get 
them in some shape to send to you. Look at the book titles marked "Engsvanyali" 
in "Gardasiyal," vol. 3. Ai che is a little easier because there are fewer 
texts, names, etc. It is a tone language (high, mid, low, rising, falling), with
monosyllabic and bisyllabic roots, and not very much morphological "grammar." 
Rather like Chinese, but with modifications.

[Moderator's Note:  Tidbit about the ancient city of Purdanim.           ]

Alex discusses his proposed module: The campaign module I am going to start 
working on will be Pariah Diety-centric, with considerable travel to the 
underworlds of Purdimal, Purdanim(and you thought it was lost forever beneath 
effluvial mud! Nexal point travel is a wonderful thing!)

Last group that travelled by nexus point to the ruins of old Purdanim were 
unhappily suffocated in topsoil deep beneath the surface. Couldn't get their 
magic to work down there -- something about the proximity of metal...?

[Moderator's Note:  Alex and Professor Barker talk about the ruined city  ]
[                   of Hmakuyal.                                          ]

Alex' Question: Hmakuyal is a "ruins" -- was the city razed for Ditlana and then
>never rebuilt? Was something "unspeakable" found below? Isn't it one of the
>more ancient sites of Ksarul worship? Any information would me appreciated!

Hmakuyal is situated in a great volcanic "sink: a roundish depression that is 
deepest on the western side. The walls of this place have been honeycombed with 
caverns, passages, etc., and great images of Lord Ksarul, his Aspects, his 
mythological exploits, etc. are carved here and thhere all around. Travellers 
come in from the east, enter into a maze of pilgrimage centres, tombs and 
graveyards, and fallen temples dating from Engsvanyali times. Then they go on 
into ring after ring of caverns, shrines, and the like until they are deep 
within the western wall. There are dwelling places there, too, monasteries for 
priests (and priestesses), great meeting halls, and other elegant things too 
numerous to recount. The city apparently fell into ruin at the end of the 
Engsvanyali Period and was only partially restored. It was not Ditlana that is 
the cause but rather internceine warfare between the latter-day priesthood of 
Ksarul and the growing power of the incipient Tlakotani Dynasty. This is all 
forgiven now, but many remember. Lord Ksarul's temple has had to be polite to 
the Tlakotanis, and indeed, a few Emperors have been followers of the Blue 
Prince.

You are correct to some extent. Fu Shi claims to have come over the North Pole, 
via the "Black Ships" that sometimes appear in the northern seas. He is a 
character I have kept somewhat secret because I have a use for him later.

His name is Methudalai. Ugly critter.

This is a complex question that requires time for a proper reply.  In brief: the
temple of Ksarul believed that its ancient lineages (from Dormoron Plain) gave 
it an edge: Dark Moon, Dark Fear, etc. These clans trace themselves back to Lord
Ksarul's bodyguard units (right or wrong).  The Red clans of the southwest (Red 
Sun, Red Sword, etc.) joined with the Hnalla and Avanthe clans of the central 
Empire to combat them. The Tlakotanis have since pushed all this history into 
semi-secret "closed stacks"  in their libraries. They would like the ancient 
rivalry forgotten because they want to maintain unity against the Mu'ugalavyani 
and other rivals. The fall of Hmakuyal is thus blamed on a variety of other 
causes -- including an invasion by minions of the Pariah Deities! The Petal 
Throne is said to have been shipped from Malchairan in N'luss (where it was 
apparently found) to Tsolyanu at the end of the Engsvanyali Era. It was set up 
as an icon of the Tlakotani during the reigns of the first Emperors (who can be 
sure of just which one?)

You're asking questions that each need a treatise to answer! In VERY short form:
there never was a true Kolumejalim because Dhich'une declared he had invited his
rivals, and nobody showed up. This is what caused all the fuss. Afterward, 
Taksuru (the young Ksarul prince) declared himself in Bey Su and gathered 
support. He lost it by inexperience, unfortunately, plus the hostility of his 
rivals and people who should have supported him. Eselne refused to give up the 
Gold and instead grabed most of the northwest; Mirusiya retired to Fasiltum with
his Vriddi mistress Elara ( -- if it's really she?). He tried to penetrate 
Avanthar a couple of times but never got in. Rereshqala came out of retirement, 
built up an army, and took over most of the south. He tried for an alliance with
Eselne but failed, then with Taksuru, who accepted but had no real troops to 
give him. Mridobu reappeared, managed to enter Avanthar when Dhich'une was not 
there (I know -- Emperors are not supposed to leave the Golden Tower, but 
Dhich'une sneaked away to attend a major ceremony in the City of Sarku). For two
days Mridobu ruled in Avanthar, but then Dhich'une's Undead came up out of the 
basements and did ugly things. Dhich'une is now back, ruling, but weakened.

Nobody's been down to see the Urunen for a long time. Who knows what they're 
doing! The High Prefect of the Omnipotent Azure Legion fled there after 
Dhich'une took over, and for awhile one of the minor Princesses was with him. 
Nobody has any idea where he is now, but the Princess retired, gave up the Gold,
and went back to being a sculptress, which she had always wanted to be.

No idea, really. His fate is sealed in the great Book of Deeds in Avanthar. Only

Proably not. It can't be proved one way or the other of course -- too much time 
has passed since the Latter Times. Most human legends show the Mihalli as alien,
whimsical, and quite uintelligible. They never did show much interest in human 
society or in "teaching" humanity. A VERY, _VERY_ few have ever even bothered to
talk to us. This is why Aiya in "Flamesong" is so unique, but, then, he's under 
the baleful influence of Lord Fu Shi'i. 

What the Tsolyani temples teach as "Mihalli" language is probably a joke to the 
Mihalli themselves: "Pidgin Mihalli." On the level of "Great White Father teach-
um brain surgery!" There are only a few texts (that are readable), and these may
be later simplifications and distortions by people like the wizard Metallja. 
Sure, I can help you with some lexemes and a little grammar, but it is going to 
pretty sorry stuff. The "Great" Mihalli inscriptions (in the caves out in what 
is now Mihallu -- occupied almost exclusively by humans, as you proably know) 
are still 99% unintelligible. You should have heard the silly theories last year
at the conference the Temple of Thumis held at Paya Gupa!

Who knows? You'd have to ask Pavar, if you ever meet him on one of the Many

The problem is that your "history" might mess up some of my other devious 
plotlines. I don't mind you working up "alternate universe" history, or doing 
bits that are put out as "legends," "possible history," etc., but I hate to give
out juicy "truths" because it takes away some of the mystery of Tekumel and 
forces my history into directions I may not want to go. Legends for use in your 
own campaigns are just fine, but they cannot be "authentic TRUE Tekumel history"
unless I give them some pretty deep thought...

I don't mind talking about it -- it's common knowledge in the ports of Yan Kor 
and Pijjena. The problem is that it takes a LOT of energy to hunt out my facts 
and type them into an e-mail letter! The Black Ships come from over the Pole -- 
apparently there are ways around the ice cap that lies about 30 hexes north of 
the northernmost hex you can see on the Zocchi map. The Black Ships contain 
leather-clad traders and warriors who seek gold, furs, fancy goods, etc. in Yan 
Kor and the south. They do not often disembark, and they never leave their ships
to travel southward by land. Some seem to have sorcerous powers, like Fu Shi'i, 
while others are reputed to be fine warriors and sailors. They have not been a 
major problem, which is why they are not much mentioned in any of my books. I 
suppose one could take passage on one of these ships and go across the pole. But
rumour has it that those kingdoms are ruled by Hokun, who use humans as slaves.

[Moderator's Note:  This message deals heavily with linguistics.  Alex has  ]
[quite an interest in one of the things that makes Tekumel unique, its      ]
[languages.  This deals with Engsvanyali and Classical Mu'ugalavyani.       ]

<A linguistic discussion concerning the genetic relationship between an
oceanic language spoken on the other side of Tekumel and the Khishan-family
prevalent in the Five Empires -- notice the tie in to the Pariah Deities and
their "languages" NOTE: NOTHING I SAY IS OFFICIAL TEKUMEL. This is all
speculation on things I believe I have uncovered -- more will follow. >

<Alex>
The language (a language I am developing for my Tekumel module called
Na'ashya) bears some common phonological elements with the Khishan group
(like the tl), but has diverged greatly over the past four thousand years.
The last two thousand, with the virtual isolation of the archipelago, has
accelerated this even further. There is, however, a relationship to Zna'ye
and Sunuz. Why? It seems that the servitors of the Pariah Deities have
adopted, at least for purposes of communication with the Tekumelani,
variations of these languages as a sort of "diplomatic language". Hence,
Na'ashya is replete with "loan words" and creolizations. After several
thousand years, these almost ritual-languages have become quasi-standardized
among the adherents of the Goddess. This is sort of like the relationship of
late Latin and, say, Medieval French -- lots of "phonological variation", a
semi-common "technical vocabulary", and plenty of local "color".

<Barker>
This sounds pretty good. One may wonder how "diplomatic" contacts were 
maintained over the great distances involved. Tubeway cars? Nexus points?

<Alex>
The phoneme that I have trouble with is the "tl" -- any suggestions, aside
from the Nahuatl reference, on how to pronounce it? I am not certain I am
doing it justice -- just like when I try to form the "retro-velar "k" sound
from Arabic)

<Barker> 
For /tl/ put the tip of your tongue where you usually pronounce /t/, then open 
the lateral (cheek) passages and make an "ell" sound. You now have a "t-lllll" 
combination. Now you need to stop vibrating your voacl chords to make the "ell" 
sound voiceless -- as in Welsh Llewellyn -- and you get a kind of hissing, 
lateral fricative. The voiceless /l/ fricative is used in Tsolyani and is 
written /hl/, and the affricate /tl/ is also used.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<Alex asked several questions about the phonology of Engsvanyali - what follows
is a chat back and forth>

<Barker>
>By the bye, how do you want the apostrophe pronounced in your words for 
>Heresiarchs in the title of your book: "Tipika Hereziark'a?" (Do I have it 
>right?) Engsvanyali has no glottalised consonants, and a "k" followed by a 
>glottal stop is extremely rare. The "'" has to represent some sound -- it
can't be there just to look cute. -- Oh, I know you know this. Why am I 
repeating it?

<Alex>
If Engsvanyali does not really support a glottalized consonant, then the
title should go to Tipika Hereziarka'a.

<Barker>
Classical Mu'ugalavyni actually had glottalised consonants, as does modern 
Pe'e. Now you rarely get names like "Dhich'une" in which a glottal stop comes as
part of a cluster with a stop or affricate.

<Alex>
Does Engsvanyali have a hard
'z'-sound -- or would it be closer to a slavic 'zh'?

<Barker>
What's a "hard" "z"? Like what? The "z" in "zip?" If so, then, yes, it does have
a /z/. It ALSO has the /zh/ in Zhukov.

<Alex>
How about word initial
'h' -- is it "silent" like in Spanish (I hope not)?

<Barker>
No, the /h/ in ALL Tekumelani languaeges is either a real voiceless glottal 
fricative (/h/) or else it is not there!

<Alex>
Every letter in the
title is meant to be pronounced -- and the vowels are supposed to be very
clear and "crisp" -- no English (eyyya, oouuya, whatever..). Does the a'a
bit fit a bit more into your concept of Engsvanyali.

<Barker>
Yes. I usually use the Spanish vowels as examples of the vowel systems -- until 
they do not fit any more. Thus the "umlaut u" and its counterpart, the 
"unrounded back u" (the Turkish "i with two dots") have to have special symbols.
I once used "y" for this (e.g. Hry'y), but then everybody said "Hreye-eye" or 
something equally discouraging. Now I use the umlaut u and let the readers 
stumble as best they can.

As for the /q/, it is nothing more than a "k" made down deeper in the throat. 
Try saying "kool" as far back your throat as possible. This is a serious matter 
for those who learn Arabic, Urdu, or any of a host of Amerindian languages: e.g.
Arabic /tahrik/ and /tahriq/ or /kul/ and /qul/. I never use a "q" as just a 
cute way of writing a /k/. Similarly, I don't use it just to jazz up the 
appearance of names. Try a name like /qwanu/ versus /kwasa/ -- or, with a 
syllabic back vowel instead of the non-syllabic /w/, a word like /kuar or /
quadar/. These are all different in Khishan languages.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<Alex asked a question about the ancient Mihalli language and its use in books
and treatises concerning ancient technology>

<Barker>
Sure, I can help you with some lexemes and a little grammar, but it is
going to pretty sorry stuff. The "Great" Mihalli inscriptions (in the caves out 
in what is now Mihallu -- occupied almost exclusively by humans, as you
probably know) are still 99% unintelligible. You should have heard the silly
theories last year at the conference the Temple of Thumis held at Paya Gupa!

<Alex>
But, still enough to read/decypher the "Book of Eyes"! By the way, why would
the Mihalli have been so interested in Ancient Technology -- unless
their own civilization had a technological basis as well? Or was Mihalli
just the language used to transcribe the "Eye Manual"? 

<Barker>
I suspect the Lords of the Latter Times had a lot to do with making Mihalli a 
language for arcane books. I don't think the book was really written by any 
actual Mihalli -- just put into the language the humans THOUGHT was Mihalli. 
What the Mihalli said about it is not recorded. They do have technological 
devices (the "Globes of Instant Eventuation"), but how they see technology is 
not intelligible to the human mind.


Alex's Note:
<This might be a little more food for thought - or not - I am not sure how
many people aside from Prof. Barker and I are really interested in the
phonological variation of /tl/ in Classical Tsolyani, Engsvanyali, and
Na'ashya (a new language I have discovered being spoken in a remote island
chain on the other side of Tekumel!>

     Floyd Brigdon

Greetings Floyd,

I recently ran a few games at SAGA which is a fairly major con here in 
Sydney Australia.  I used the 'Just Off the Boat' scenario provided in >Eye 
4<.  The PC's in this scenario are Islanders from Falesa near Ssamris Isle 
whose territory has recently been claimed by the Mu'uglavayani.  The 
villagers consider themselves Tsolyani and sail off to Tsolyanu to get help 
for the Island.  I provided players with plenty of background info about 
Tekumel and their clan and origins, etc.  For this I used Patrick Bradys 
'You're not in Kansas Anymore' introductory article and some of the notes 
provided in 'Just off the Boat' again form >Eye 4<.

All but one of the fifteen or so players involved had no experience of 
Tekumel, most had not even heard of it.  With a world as rich as Tekumel 
throwing a novice in at the deep end and expecting them to act like a 
nobleman is a bit much to ask.  Players need to be introduced gradually and 
learn from their mistakes.

The sessions I ran went remarkably well, they were run almost freeform with 
minimum dice rolling but maximum description, narrative and role-playing, as 
I believe Tekumel should be.  The response was one of enjoyment and a 'I'd 
like to play this again' attitude.

With a scenario where the players are complete barbarians the lack of 
Tsolyani-ness can detract from the flavour of the game.  PC's need to start 
behaving like Tsolyani at some point after all.  In a scenario where the 
PC's start off in the Sea Blue clan they could soon find all the new 
information and behaviour too much to take in and as a result become hostile 
to Tekumel.

I have run and played in all sorts of Tekumel games.  As a player and GM I 
have found that the best introductory games give a good flavour of Tekumel 
but not a fatal  overdose.  So the idea of 'foreign' Tsolyani speakers whose 
ways have deviated from the current norm of the Empire does the trick 
nicely.

The other main point is to prepare your players, time and some good 
background info is the key here.

Hope that helps and enjoy playing devious tricks on newbies, especially if 
they should act ignobley!

Dermot

Dear Floyd,

The question of where to start with a world as complex and non-Western/mediaeval
as Tekumel is a tough one. I originally thought that "Foreign Barbarians" (the 
"small boat landing in Jakalla" scenario) was the best method of getting people 
into Tsolyanu and then slowing acculturating them to the society, history, etc. 
Over the years this has worked well enough -- many such "barbarians" are now 
military officers, priests, officials, etc. in Tsolyanu, with a few in Livyanu 
as well. The "alienness" of the world can be alleviated by a good referee who 
has read the basic materials, and the players themselves then cooperate to solve
further problems. The idea of "barbarians" becoming Imperial generals is, after 
all, not unheard of -- compare later Rome.

As time went on, more and more players wanted to jump into the society with 
both feet: some status, some money, some allegiance to a temple, nation, etc. It
worked to have new players take an already-constructed character out of my 
character boxes, get a few basic ideas as to what to do, and then go at it with 
a group of older, more experienced players who had missions, Tsolyani friends, 
societal responsibilities, and the like. I still do this with occasional 
"guests" who drop in and want to play for a single evening or so: I dig out a 
card and tell them where to start. Most people quickly pick up on goals, laws, 
and methods and go right at it.

My most recent attempt to introduce Tekumel gently is enshrined in Book One of 
"Adventures on Tekumel": start everybody as high or medium clan, already with a 
family, a religion, a set of ideas, some money, some property, and the 
wherewithal to act at once in Tsolyani society. This works only if new players 
are willing to READ the booklet, roll up characters, and develop the skills, 
knowledge, and all the rest. As an alternative, I added "Archetypes" to the 
recent game publication: these are characters who can be picked up and played at
once, either to start a new campaign without the slow process of "rolling up" or
as "guests" to be played by occasional players.

All of these methods have their positives and negatives. It is very hard to 
choose between them. Bob Dushay says he prefers "foreign" Tsolyani -- people who
speak the language and know enough about the manners and customs to get along, 
but who have been "living abroad" or something and are not conversant with the 
whole culture. This is okay -- it works, too. The problem is that such "foreign 
Tsolyani" have to have been living SOMEWHERE, with somebody, and doing something
-- ??? Explaining a youth who grew up in the wilds of Jannu or Rannalu is about 
as hard as introducing a character who grew up in the suburbs outside Jakalla! 
(Not in the city itself -- that is, actually, too complex, perhaps!).

I think the character generation booklet is the best method currently, although 
I still would not introduce the group to downtown Jakalla or Bey Su. Start in a 
remote region of the Empire, perhaps, where things are simpler: Men are Men, and
Chlen are Chlen! Try a remote town in the mountains up near Hekellu in the 
northeast, or in the foothills of the Chakas, or even in the breadbasket of the 
Empire in some village or town that is a backwater.

I still may not have the right answer here. Everybody is different, and what 
suits one group may not suit the next one. If the unfamiliarities get to be too 
much, one can always simplify still further: a single Tsolyani ship cast away on
a deserted island somewhere. Pitcairn Island, anyone?

Check with your players and see what they will enjoy most. When in doubt, ask a 
player character ...

Good luck.

This question of clan and barbarians has always baffled me, when thinking
about starting a group in Tsolyanu, or running a one-off.  I want to run
something that feels like Tsolyanu, which is why I hesitate.  I wonder if
someone could clarify my thinking.  The problems starting up are these:

A) If the players are barbarians, do they have clans, or clan consciousness?  

If they do, how do we impart this to the players?  If we tell them they are
members of Azure Gems (for example), or of several clans, how did they get
to be members of such mainland clans?  But actually, I suppose this is a
reasonable approach... the bumpkin country cousin from the offshore island
where all they know is Hluss are bad for your health.

If not, they are always going to be aliens in Tsolyanu, and unable to really
participate in Tsolyani society, and are restricted to dungeon-crawling, as
no-one of good clan will want to talk to them.  

B)  If they contact the local clan house, what sort of treatment are they
entitled to, and what is expected of them?  Is this a quick way to get food
and lodging, plus a patron of some kind?

C)  Sorcerors and priests:  where do they/did they get their training - or
do we presume they start as ordinary people and then start training in
Jakalla - which doesn't seem to make for good role-playing.

It doesn't seem that the PC's can sensibly be barbarians in any normal
sense.  Rather, they must be country cousins from an incredibly cut-off part
of Tsolyanu, where there is hardly any knowledge of the country or its customs.

Thoughts, anyone?

I've always preferred to use the 'displaced foreigner' schtick with players
who are new to Tekumel. I published the best intro scenario I ever did in
the first issue of EYE OF ALL-SEEING WONDER: this had a whole small tribe
of refugees setting up house in the Foreigners' Quarter of Jakalla. You 
might like to look it up.

The advantage is that your players can start by playing characters as naive
about Tekumel as they are. You never have to say: "Well, actually you'd 
already know...." Afterwards you can start to introduce native Tsolyani
characters. Or if you have a couple of players who know something about Tekumel
then you can cast them as the patrons/employers of the immigrants. 

That said, if you are willing to write a huge amount of briefing material then
by all means jump straight in....

[Moderator's Note:  Bob Alberti adds this to the Starting characters thread. ]

On "How to Start":

I can only speak from my own experience regarding Tekumel.  I began my 
first character in Professor Barker's campaign in Jakalla... and then got 
ON the boat!  Arjai met me when he was a high-clan (Azure Gems) young 
Ksarul priest, and was tossed immediately into foreign intrigue and 
high-level interplanar exploits.  While this has by no means failed to 
entertain, it has not exposed me to the nuances of Tsolyani daily life.

My second character, a warrior of Chiteng, was only briefly annoyed by my 
manipulating his fate.  He was assigned to carry a message to Prince 
Mirusiya before I could get to know him too well.  As far as I know he's 
still out there somewhere, giving "lessons" to the little girls in the 
Temple of Hrihayal when off-duty...

However, this third fellow I'm harassing is turning out rather well.  
Prof. Barker recently encouraged his Thursday-night group (three hours to 
go and counting!) to retire its regular characters for a while.  
We took up new characters rolled right out of the generation modules.

The scenario is quite interesting.  An low-level Avanthe priestess has been 
willed or given deed to a fief in the mountains northeast of Sokatis.  
Several parties tried to take it from her by one means or another, 
including the Governor of Sokatis who offered her 27,000 kaitars for the 
property.

Upon visiting the place, we discovered that Ssu and Salarvyani incursions 
had forced into hiding those locals who had not been killed.  An abandoned 
temple nearby apparently was holding a demon at bay, and an iron mine 
abandoned nearby had yielded a healthy stash of iron... hidden beneath 
bales of centuries-old grain in the cellars.  The temple of Hru'u sent 
their top agent to try to confisticate the abandoned temple from the 
priestess...

This has been a fun campaign.  The minutiae of rebuilding and running a 
fief are engaging, and get one right down into the complex interactions of 
Tsolyani society.  Matters are minor enough not to attract Imperial 
attention, but large enough to be risky to life and limb, with rewards 
attractive to any normal Tsolyani (just one of those pig bars in the 
basement is worth a lot of money!).  And the setting is remote enough to 
involve both aliens and foreigners, and allow for self-guided action 
without having the OAL or the city guard stepping on your toes.

All in all, I'd say it would be a good scenario for any new player.  One 
learns just who-talks-to-whom.  For instance, my character is an adjutant 
to the Majordomo (there being only we two and the fiefholder in the 
administrative hierarchy), and while the Majordomo and I talk to the 
Pechani hunter who wandered out of the woods, the fiefholder would not 
deign to do so unless pressed.

Courtesy and noble action are encouraged:  had I not been noble and 
respectful of the visiting Horokangai<sp?> monks <?>, they might not have 
been inclined to help out when the Salarvyani came for our iron hoard.  By 
being noble and civilized to the Horokangai, they saw fit to slaughter the 
Salarvyani after those of us in the tower had been variously poisoned, 
stabbed and/or locked in the former treasure vault.

This level of play -- below the bottom of the top, but at the top of the 
middle -- has a nice familiar feel to it.  Enough freedom to allow for 
choice and courage, the city near enough for intrigue, and middling-high 
stakes encouraging risk but not foolhardiness.  A good setting under which 
to get a feel for the game.

Roger Pearse seems to have trouble with something that seems obvious to me:

If the PCs are true barbarians then they do not come from any part of the Five
Empires. They are from far off the maps and are refugees from some unpleasant-
ness in their homelands. They are not even 'foreigners', ie citizens of the
other Empires. They probably don't speak Tsolyani at all well 
(remember to make them roll their language skills in tricky social situations!)
and are totally naive about the complexities of Tsolyani life. (But they will
pick these up in a hurry or end up on the Impaling Post!)

This is the situation as depicted in the classic EPT opening and in my article
in EYE 1: Welcome to Jakalla.

On the other hand in EYE 4 there was an article proposing starting with a group
with Tsolyani citizenship but from a remote coastal island. These are *not*
barbarians. Just country cousins with dung between their toes and ears. They
have a clan, citizenship and the language (which they probably speak with the
Tsolyani equivalent of an 'ooo-arrr' Mummerset accent). This is a halfway
house between the barbarian opening and starting with full Tsoyalni citizens.

It is possible but hard to make a living as a barbarian foreigner in Tsolyanu.
True you are the lowest of the low but you have something to aim for: Imperial
Citizenship. And you can be of great use to Imperial factions who have dirty 
deeds they won't trust to anyone with any face to loose...

With the country cousins, you get treated like country cousins: which is as well
or as ill as the GM feels like treating you. With the true barbarian, well 
unless you brought your clan with you you're in for a lonely time until you
accumulate enough money to bribe....ummm, make that induce some clan to adopt 
you.

>C)  Sorcerors and priests:  where do they/did they get their training - or

The country cousins would probably have enough priests around back home to get
at least basic training but nothing like what was available in a great city. 
True barbarians would have the tribal shaman to teach those with a talent for
psionics or ritual.

consciousness?

In the scenario I described the PC's belong to one of three families or 
lineages.  All are related but vary in status.  There is no official 'clan', 
but as members of the village of Falesa they are all of the same clan except 
in name.  i.e. the relationships and structures are the same but over 200 
yrs the name has been lost.  It is not necessary to have a clan name as they 
do not have to distinguish themselves from other 'clans', they are all from 
the Island of Falesa.

They are related to a low or medium clan (can't remember which one) that 
originally settled the Island around 2020 AS, or rather kicked out the Red 
Hats.  Unfortunately they don't know this, yet.

>B)  If they contact the local clan house, what sort of treatment are they
>entitled to, and what is expected of them?  Is this a quick way to get food
>and lodging, plus a patron of some kind?

If they just turned up with an unvalidated claim they'd be kicked into the 
street.  If they manage to get some proof from old records or their claim is 
supported by a patron they may get the treatment they deserve.  This is the 
main sub plot of the game, recognition as citizens!

>C)  Sorcerors and priests:  where do they/did they get their training - or

The traditions would be handed down over generations.  Although this means 
that certain rituals and sorceries would differ from the modern norm.  Also 
they are not cut off *completely* from the greater world just a backwater. 
The recent histories even state that they have had a couple of visitors 
from Tsolyanu, these events were then followed by good harvests.  These 
differences give the players a license to act away from the Tsolyani norm, 
they also give the GM the chance to play up the 'heresy' factor.  :-)

Mostly correct except the knowledge available is up to the characters to 
decide from what they have learned from the handouts.  The professors 
comments of 'ask the players' ring true here.  If the players want to play 
high flying nobles let them, but for the uninitiated, like convention 
gamers, this halfway house is often the best way.

Just my thoughts,

Dermot

If you start your players off as "barbarians," you can let them come from a 
clan-oriented tribal society -- or, for more alienness, from one that has no 
clans and rough social equality. The latter would face real culture shock -- 
almost as much as westen Europeans and Americans do when confronted with 
Tekumel. Depends on the referee and his/her abilities.

A bumpkin cousin from ANYWHERE in Tsolyanu will know his/her clan and will be 
familiar with the concepts. People are born into clans, but occasionally they 
may be adopted into clans, too. Players who start as barbarians should make 
friends, give gifts and bribes, and try to get into a clan as soon as possible.

>If not, they are always going to be aliens in Tsolyanu, and unable to really
>participate in Tsolyani society, and are restricted to dungeon-crawling, as
>no-one of good clan will want to talk to them.  

Barbarians can be hired by Tsolyani contacts and can thus participate in 
society, as long as they keep their place and don't get impudent or mouthy. 
Slowly, with care both by players and referee, they can be integrated in 
society, working their way up from "dungeon-crawling" (dangerous, that! Tomb-
robbing is a capital offense, if caught...) and simple adventures (e.g. 
bodyguarding, caravan-guarding, errands, delivering messages, and the like) to 
something much higher when they get used to the place. You can always start out 
with the first volume of "Adventures on Tekumel," as I said in a previous 
submission.If you wish, you can follow the solitaire adventure books (also from 
TOME) to gain further insight into the societies, geography, history, etc. etc.

>B)  If they contact the local clan house, what sort of treatment are they
>entitled to, and what is expected of them?  Is this a quick way to get food
>and lodging, plus a patron of some kind?

If they are "country bumpkins," they can take a letter from their own village/
town clanmaster and show it anywhere in the Empire at another clanhouse of their
clan. They'll be given lodging according to their stations, food in the communal
refectory, advice on local business, sights, etc. etc., fresh clothing, baths 
(the Tsolyani are fastidious), a massage, a slave girl or two for the night, if 
they are of high lineage or wealthy, etc. etc. The clanmaster can then direct 
them to meet possible patrons and contacts. As long as they are courteous and 
try to help the clan, they will be welcome to stay. Of course, they must try to 
find jobs or ways to earn money so that they can return something to their clan.
The business or job must also be of a level approved by that clan: e.g. a member
of Sea Blue or Cloak of Azure Gems is NOT going to become a slaver or tomb-
robber and expect his clan to coddle him! A member of Nighted Tower, however, 
could easily apply for a job as an embalmer (and work nights as a tomb roober), 
and his clan would approve.

>C)  Sorcerors and priests:  where do they/did they get their training - or
>do we presume they start as ordinary people and then start training in

Training takes too long in the game. Use the books mentioned above to gain 
initial spells. If you want quickies, use the Archetypes in "Gardasiyal" as 
guides.

>It doesn't seem that the PC's can sensibly be barbarians in any normal
>sense.  Rather, they must be country cousins from an incredibly cut-off part
>of Tsolyanu, where there is hardly any knowledge of the country or its 
>customs.

We've done both barbarians and country cousins. The main thing is that clans 
provide contacts, loans, jobs, status, etc. I recall one player who had incurred
a huge det. He was about to run off, commit suicide, or just drop his character 
because he feared being slammed into debtor's prison, impaled, chased by 
assassins sent by creditors, etc. I gently asked, "What clan are you?" "Cloak of
Azure Gems," he answered. I said, "Go see your clanmaster." He was not from this
city, but he went anyway. The clanmaster heard him out and then said, "What is 
the matter with you? Ten thousand Kaitars? It would be a shame upon our clan to 
owe a debt so small! Take this writ and hand it to your creditors. Then smile 
politely and walk away." The player was so thunderstruck that he talked about it
for days. He had almost insulted his clan by NOT coming to them!

Tekumel demands non-player characters who are not just "thickies" or 
"statistics." They are real people, with real interests, needs, and tastes. Non-
player wives are another way to provide help, advice, and other plot features. 
Non-player officers, soldiers, priests, etc. cannot just be used as adjuncts to 
the player's personality: they may be brave, cowardly, loyal, disloyal -- 
whatever. Try telling a poorly paid guard to enter a dangerous ruin and take 
blows for you! Maybe... if he really likes you... (A roll of the non-player 
reaction dice).

Establish a group of non-player characters, with goals and interests, and let 
the players lean on these people until they can function in the society for 
themselves. This works for me. Hope it works for others!

>Thoughts, anyone?

I have to agree strongly with Mr. Pearse - the foreigner-on-a-boat starting
option is really far too constraining and ambiguous to be of much use.
However, I find the "country bumpkin" option to be faced with similar
problems as the "stranger in a strange land" option. Instead, I propose a
starting scenario in which the players are already members of Tsolyani
society - and not just 0 circle acolytes or Kuruthuni in one of the legions.
No -- they would be members of the elite of the Empire -- relatively high
ranking officials, career military officers, upper level priests(Jokalto+).
A scenario would be bult around them. Examples would include: the
disintegration of the Tsolyani Empire in civil war, trouble with the
Mu'ugalavyani, skullduggery among the temple factions/power struggles,
infiltration of the Tsolyani bureaucracy by foreign agents, helping a
disgruntled Tsolyani Prince (Eselne, Mirusiya) etc.

In my own campaign, players start out in the mid-to-upper echelon of
Tsolyani society (typically 5-8th Circle/Rank, high and very high clans,
excellent lineages, cultured and educated). The philosophical position I
take on this is that the best way to understand Tekumel is to be immersed in
it! Don't waste time in set-up scenarios (i.e. getting off the boat, finding
slum lodgings in the Foreigners' Quarter, getting hired by that Tsolyani
Nobleman to be his bodyguard...etc.). Instead, BE the Tsolyani nobleman!
Players must be given cues and information on how to behave, and then set
loose to "work out the details" of their lives as Tsolyani citizens. The
proposition is that players are best acquainted with Tekumel by viewing
things from the inside, as members of their respective societies. 

This has a corollary, however. The GM must provide detailed biographical and
"contextual" information for starting players: clan, lineage, childhood
friends and acquaintences, early life experiences, mentors, idiosyncracies,
personality, physiology, and --my favorite-- languages and educational
information. This typically runs to about a 500-1000 word biographical
sketch, appended to the the player character sheet. Another strategy that I
personally enjoy is to not provide players with any standard "character
sheets". Only provide them with the biographical material, their clan,
lineage, occupation, rank/circle, and any skills/languages that they have
acquired. Translate all quantitative ranking into qualitative terms. (i.e.
skills become ranked as either "neophyte, elementary, advanced, expert") The
purpose of this is to remove the reliance on mechanics from new players -
who usually come out of systems which are rule-heavy (AD&D). Move the
mechanics to the background, and Tekumelani culture and history to the
foreground!

In my camapign, I generate all of the player characters (using Swords and
Glory, vol.2), develop their backgrounds for the players, then provide the
biographical material to the players, along with non-statistical information
about the player characters they will be "inhabiting". No one, aside from
the GM,  knows their HBS factor, Body Damage Points, Psychic Reservoir,
Intelligence, etc. They only know what they can see, learned,  and
experienced. In the real world most people have no quantitative basis for
measuring most of these "attributes" anyway. (standardized intelligence
tests aside - most people don't know their scores) It is a legacy attribute
of 1st generation rpg systems that characters are even defined by using
d100s, tables, etc. I try to consciously break with that mentality. All of
the mechanics of the character generation system are masked out -- leaving
the players and GM to concentrate on "personality development". The GM must
ensure that players who do not have the prerequisites for certain
occupations/skills be made aware of that fact. (Example: A player's
character, a yound acolyte on the Temple of Thumis named Omel hiKuroda, who
wants to get "sorcerous training" (but lacks the intelligence minimum),
would be taken aside by a mentor within the temple and told, "We all like
you very much, but you just don't quite seem to have what it takes to really
go very far in this area...perhaps you might like to try the administrative
brach of our temple -- I have a good friend there who would love to meet
you...etc....etc.) In this way the "barrier" to the underlying mechanics
stratum is never reached -- and players are treated as "real people" -- not
amalgamations of d100 roles and table lookups. This goes a long way to
overcoming new player anxiety about Tekumel - since they do not have to
"worry" about the mechaics system (Gardasiyal, EPT, Swords and Glory). 

By placing players "in medea res" (in the midst of things) with enough
context, the need for all of those thrilling "I just arrived in a boat at
Jakalla..." can be obviated and one can procede to the intriguing scenarios:
political infighting amoung the temples, covert assassination and subterfuge
by the secret societies (Ndalu Clan, Cusp of Night, etc.), Real politik
between Tsolyanu and other nations (such as the recent Mu'ugalavyani
developments), etc. This is not to denigrate the foreigner starting option.
It may work very well for some groups. I just find that players are much
better when they have something to lose -- their prestige, position, wealth,
"power" -- and not when they are "fresh off the boat" and desperately
searching for a job/adventure to take them out of the slum hellholes they
find themselves in. This gives the GM a better opportunity to manipulate and
steer players within a scenario/campaign -- by playing on their "exalted
positions" -- and the Machiavellian machinations which are ubiquitous in
cosmopolitan Tsolyani/Tekumelani society. People who have something to lose
are usually far more interesting (in their reactions) than those who have
nothing to begin with. The point is this: create a situation in which the
player is lost in the part -- threaten his position in the
hierarchy(somebody wants his job), put him in a precarious political
situation (will he sign an oath of allegiance to the new Emperor being
circulated by the newly "reformed" (read: Sarku-worshipper infested)
Omnipotent Azure Legion?), etc.

This is a philosophical position: I do not believe that RPGing on Tekumel is
best served by always being  tied to a "Bildungsroman" structure: one where
the player is slowly maturing and gaining confidence and power, overcoming
obstacles, etc. This is the stereotypical model which has devolved from D&D:
start out as weak as a fly, and gradually "build up". This "hero model" is
quite limiting and leads to a sort of vocational/psychological tunnel
vision. It has the unfortunate effect of leading to a "grab everything
valuable in sight" mentality -- players become more focused on advancing
ranks/circles than in BEING-THEIR-CHARACTER. This is why I have always
militated against the "experience points system" -- it breaks the suspension
of disbelief necessary to truly get-into-character. This is merely my
opinion, however. Persuasive counter - arguements can (and should) be made.

I much prefer the "drama" (read: political scheming and power politics) of
the Renaissance Italian "Houses" (Medici) and the character-driven ethos of
Raymond Chandler: everyone is already-who-they-are-"supposed"-to-be, what
follows is the consequences of that fact being played out. Macbeth, anyone?
This goes back to Shakespear's line "Character is fate.". The lack of this
"view" in RPG systems has always been really problematic. The world of
Tekumel has always been an exception to this (at least potentially). My
question is this: why RPG for years (in realtime) before you are allowed to
acquire "Temple Spells"or a great position in society? Why not just create
the starting parameters of the Tekumel session in such a way that the
players already "have" everything they need to get involved in the serious
(read: non-dungeon crawling) roleplaying on Tekumel. Forget those rules
about "having to be tenth circle" before you can learn temple spells -- just
have the GM assign the appropriate spells to the players! If this means
creating starting players who are Mriyen in the Temple of Belkhanu, or
Molkar in the Legion of the Givers of Sorrow, -- so be it! Players as
personal friends of Prince Rereshqala helping the prince to overcome the
political chaos of the post-Hirkane Tlakotani period -- sounds great! Swords
and Glory (volumes1 & 2) were perhaps the BEST example of a rpg mechanics
system that allowed for this type of playing style: you could generate
players of any "level" -- and have a huge amount of ethnological,
historical, and political material on which to draw.

My suggestion thus boils down to this: Create a compelling, dramatic milieu
in the "heart" of Tsolyanu (Bey Su, Tumissa, Urmish, Jakalla), establish a
strong narrative framework for the entire player group, then create detailed
player characters and insert them into an already unfolding action/story.
Have the stakes be VERY VERY high. Hook players up with established NPCs and
characters out of the source material generated by Professor Barker -- and
go! This dramatic-literary technique (in medea res)  is as old as the hills
(and twice as dusty) - but it really works.

[Moderator's Note:  Professor Barker comments on Alex's message about    ]
[                   starting characters.                                 ]

More on starting characters:

I hasten to agree that the "barbarians on a boat" idea is no more than a rather 
slipshod game device for the first EPT. It made no more sense than having a 
Hottentot refugee float into New York harbour on a raft! It worked because it 
was fast, and it gave players time to acculturate. We have all pointed out its 
many drawbacks. Nuff sed.

The "country bumpkin" (or Tsolyani travellers washed ashore -- etc.) gambits 
have similar problems. Players require more background than they can be given in
a few minutes. Unlike other game worlds, Tekumel is NOT a familiar place...

The method used in Book One of "Adventures on Tekumel" comes closer to Alex' 
idea: young nobles, with backgrounds, missions, and skills all ready to go. This
takes a little time (particularly if one wants to go through the solitaire 
adventure books to gain further familiarity), but it does provide reasonably 
high level, acculturated people.

I wonder how many referees would be willing to try Alex' idea of starting people
off with really high level posts, however. One of the frequent reasons I am 
given for people NOT playing Tekumel is that "It's too alien, too difficult to 
start -- only Professor Barker himself can run it!" While this is patently not 
true (witness all of you good folk out there on the BlueRoom line!), it may well
be true for some gamers. People don't know what to do, where to go, how to 
start, how to react. A thousand word synopsis of their characters may be seen as
daunting, difficult, and perhaps "not fun" for a group that wants to enjoy a 
gaming evening and not study anthropology! Alex is lucky to have players who are
somewhat more interested and accepting than many I've met!

Players may find it VERY daunting to start in the midst of "high level" 
intrigues, tasks, and military adventures without working up to these more 
gradually. Being handed a sheaf of Imperial documents and told to "deal with the
problem" sounds like a good way to scare more timid players away. Or: "The enemy
are just over that ridge, Sir. What are your commands for the Legion?" Or: 
"Great Ksarul, man! Your wife's pregnant! I hear it was the High Priest of 
Thumis...!" Or: "The Governor's ordered you arrested for treason so he can 
inherit your estate -- which is being overrun by Pe Choi any way..."

Alex's point about "game" stastistics reminds me of a referee I played with long
ago, who never let players roll dice at all. He asked what each player wanted to
do, then rolled dice behind his "shield" and reported what happened -- including
combat. "Well, you struck, missed, and are now quite dead..." Most players want 
more control than this. But Alex is right about some of this: nothing frustrates
me more than players who want "rules" so they can control the situation to their
benefit -- unrealistically. The player who looks at a hostile stranger and asks,
"What level is he?" How does one know how strong or magically potent, etc. a 
person met on the street really is in this world? When somebody says, "Your 
money or your life!" do you have any way to assess his fighting level? Yet I 
continually hear pleas for more "rules" so that players can manipulate them to 
achieve their goals and stay alive. I take a middle ground here between the 
"rules lawyers" and Alex: rules, yes; manipulate them too much, no.

Some players develop their non-player character followers into veritable 
chesspieces who are utterly loyal, tremendously skilled, and organised like a 
fine-tuned machine. One fellow brought about 70 dossiers on his non-player 
followers, each more amazingly talented (and loyal1) than the last. He had these
minions "trained" to fight like the Rockettes: this round the crossbowmen 
advance and fire, next round they back away through the ranks, and the sorcerers
fire spells, then the spearmen advance, then the player characters themselves 
move up and strike (to kill foemen and gain maximum experience points), etc. 
etc. I stopped him from doing this by making him roll dexterity throws every 
time his puppets had to back through their own ranks, without being able to see 
clearly, in torchlit darkness. Amazing how many became tangled up and fell all 
over themselves... All I ask is a modicum of reality. "Real" reality is 
unachievable, perhaps, but to me the story's the thing and not the "game."

I thus agree to some extent with Alex' method, but I think it would be hard to 
find many who would take on the complex task of becoming a Tsolyani high priest 
or nobleman from the very beginning -- not without a LOT of background material.
Even when such material is abundant (as in Alex' campaigns), it may be difficult
to persuade players to use it wisely. When one already has an ongoing campaign, 
on the other hand, a new player can be introduced in this way -- sink or swim --
but the other players are there to guide him and help him out of scrapes. We do 
this all the time, but my current players mostly agree that to start a whole new
GROUP out as advanced characters might be too tough for some to swallow.

For some time I did run two groups: one that insisted on rules (and manipulated 
them fiendishly to get the most out of the situation -- and me), and a second 
party that is more interested in the story line and allows me to set the stage 
and run the scenario with only occasional dice rolls. The first group is no 
longer around, while the second plays merrily on. Frankly, I am not much of a 
"competitive" gamer: I don't set out to "beat" my players or "win." I don't 
consciously try to "kill" player characters, as certain ancient and mighty names
in the industry told me they were wont to do. Players who try to beat ME can 
expect some resentment, of course, and if they escalate, then I must perforce 
escalate back -- and there is no escalator as high and powerful as a miffed 
referee!. It's the simulation of Tekumel that delights me, not how many 
"monsters" there are or how many "hit points" they have.

We don't really care about experience points any more, either, to agree with 
Alex. Nobody ever asks.

It has always struck me that it is hard to get even the most experienced players
to react as Tsolyani really would. Often, it's just how "Bill" reacts to beat 
"Jack" -- or how "Bill" reacts to get himself loot that will enhance his 
position in the player party. Sometimes it's just how "Bill" must react in order
to gain prestige and power on Tekumel that he cannot manage in this world. An 
old friend of mine has said it nicely: "I am a scuzz-butt in this world; I don't
want to be a scuzz-butt in somebody else's." I tend not to enjoy "Diplomacy" 
because it is not so much how Turkey would react to stop Germany, but rather how
Bill must ally himself with his buddies to beat Jack and Tom. Reality is not a 
major desideratum in that game. I guess.

I am dubious about fighting military campaigns on Tekumel with wargame rules. 
This is fine for isolated games or for "just suppose" games, but these cannot be
taken as "authentic" Tekumel history without the likelihood of serious damage to
Tekumel's "real" history. A gang of talented players can often beat a single, 
helpless referee (me -- the worst dice roller in the world!), and next thing you
know the Mu'ugalavyani lose when they actually win, and the Tsolyani are sacking
Ssa'atis! The players take a god-like "wargamers' viewpoint" of a battle, see 
everything, know everything, and cleverly use the rules to "play chess." I don't
mind this, as long as it is not taken as "real Tekumelani history." I recall one
wargame in which three very skilled gamers took a contingent of low-class 
Mu'ugalavyani troops and beat the kilts off the First Legion of Ever-Present 
Glory (me) by simply dancing all around and "playing rules" instead of 
simulating a real conflict. I think they lost 3 casualties, while I lost over 
400 men! A wargamer (read: chess-player) I am admittedly not!

In my view, the best way to introduce players to Tekumel is the use of nonplayer
characters who are treated as real people and not just dice-rolls. A group of 
Tsolyani officers, priests, etc. may discuss something back and forth (with me 
taking all the parts), so that the players can pick up the clues they are 
supposed to be able to see/hear for themselves. Often these non-player 
characters become more real than the players around the table themselves. The 
Tsolyani wives of two player characters at a banquet can provide more 
information (gossip) than a whole stack of written background documents!

I also make sure that the players do NOT treat their non-player comrades as just
dice rolls or targets. I recall when I first started playing that some players 
even refused to give their non-player comrades a share of the loot! "Fight all 
night, get wounded or killed, get all hot and sweaty in smelly battle armour -- 
and then these fancy-pants 'player characters' don't even split up the goodies 
with us?" When this was tried in my campaigns, the non-player characters 
demanded and fought for shares of loot -- and when the players still wanted to 
keep it all, the non-players hid what they found and then refused to work for 
player parties at all! The players kept wondering why no bodyguards, etc. could 
be found to join their little excursions!

I don't think these are "counter-arguments" against the excellent points that 
Alex raises. The only problem I see with his method is that of complexity: 
overwhelming the players with unfamiliar material, and throwing them into high 
level intrigues before they can understand what is going on and react with all 
the "savvy" that a real Tsolyani would have.

My advice? Get the players' input as to what sort of game they would enjoy. Try 
whatever method works. Experiment.

Hi.  This is another announcements message.  Lots has been going on recently.
     There are now 46 members of the list, with 4 more in the wings.  It has 
     been pointed out to me that there is a version of FM Pro for Windows.  
     The Mac data file on the ftp site can be unbinhexed on a PC.  If you 
     need the program to de-binhex, let me know.  I may put it on the site 
     itself, for ease of downloading.

1.  The ftp site is running, and is currently available from hours of 5:00 PM
    to 7:00 AM on weekdays, and all weekend.  It is also available some
    weekdays (when I am off or leave early),  but that is on an irregular 
    basis.

2.  Some people have offered to type in articles, and we currently are
    expecting the following articles to show up by the end of the month,
    hopefully:  The Temple of Ksarul, The Splendor of Shenyu, and I am
    just getting a photocopy of the Temple of Sarku to someone for trans-
    cription.  We could use more, if you can help out.

3.  I have created a contrib group on the ftp site, for user contributed 
    items on Tekumel.  This may grow to encompass any submitted documents,
    such as histories, expanded details, stories, rules additions, and 
    other creative works by Tekumel fans.  These items will not be part 
    of "Real" Tekumel, unless the Professor gives his "Seal of Approval" 
    to the item.  Once an official "Real" Tekumel item is sanctioned, it 
    will be moved to another directory of similar items.  All items in the 
    contrib directory will have a notice at the beginning of the file that 
    the material is user contributed, and may not be a part of "Real" Tekumel, 
    but is nonetheless available to be integrated into your campaign, if 
    you so wish.  The Professor has graciously agreed to look over some
    material, but his time is limited, so if stuff really piles up or is so
    detailed that he has to pull out reams of notes, it may take quite some
    time to grant the item approval.

4.  Some members have wished for a membership list.  I would be happy to keep
    such a list.  If you would like to be on the list, please send me a 
    message with the subject, Membership List, and include your email address,
    name, and city/state/province/country.  I'll compile them together and 
    put them on the ftp site.  At first I was thinking that this would be
    enough, but if you want a full address, with Phone number, we can do that,
    instead.  Let me know your preference.

5.  It is gratifying that many of you have sent me many kind words and
    thoughts.  The Blue Room is successful because of you guys, I just
    help route the traffic.  In the past 3 days, I added 10 people to 
    the list.  As noted above, we are closing in on 50 members from the
    US, Canada, England, Australia, and New Zealand.

Well, that's it for now.  Thanks everyone!

[Moderator's Note:  Still more on starting characters, this from David  ]
[                   Bailey.                                             ]

Well, I just could not let this one go.  After all, it strikes at the 
very heart of what it means to Play_A_Role.  Not only that, but it 
follows a line of thought that has been bothering me a lot lately, 
namely: where do new RPGers come from (no biology lessons needed, please).

OK, so here is my tuppenny worth.

I tend to stay away from the 'thicky barbarian' approach, purely because 
of the limited scope for advancement and interaction with the rest of 
Tsolyanu citizens.  After all, who wants to be shunned more than once a 
day?

I certainly feel there are advantages in the Sourcebook's approach of 
using low level local characters, as this allows the GM to provide 
instant briefings from established sources, and to give the role-players 
a motivation beyond the 'kill-cash-godhood' area.  Plenty of people have 
commented in this group, so I shalln't add anything more

There is an area which has not been explored here.  We have recently run 
a short campaign based on low level Livyanu characters, selected at birth 
as agents of the Vruneb (i.e. not yet tatooed) and trained in secret 
camps away from any large Livyanu city.  This allows the GM to provide 
all the briefing and training needed, whilst restricting the scope to a 
manageable area.

Off course they are called to go on active service a little earlier than 
planned, hence they have a reason to expect some gaps in their knowledge.

They are given introductions to clans in a small city, in this case Pala 
Jakalla, and are given _roles_to_play_.  Presto!  Instant acting in the 
dramatic/literary/intrigue/social style that we know and love.  (By the 
way, do all the subscribers think that you look more intelligent if you 
concatenate long words with '/'?  Perhaps it saves bandwidth.  It just 
seems to be the norm in this group to drop conjunctions....)

Not only does the mechanism give them a motive, it makes them cautious, 
and it allows them to try out behaviour in the new society.   The 
scenario worked well; only one of them got into any serious trouble, and 
they are all now established local characters.  (Albeit ones with a deep 
dark secret, one that will lead to later adventures).

A modification of this is to take a small group, say half a dozen 
soldiers, from a remote part of the empire and second them to the other 
side of Tsolyanu.  In this case the local officer, either an experienced 
player or a non-player character, to whom they are assigned can act as 
mentor.  It also helps greatly in preventing the campaign disintegrating 
into internicene plots too early in the players careers.  (Yes, I know 
that some people like that style, and it is 'typical' Tekumel, but 
neophyte gamers can be seriously put off by it.)

The 'squad forward' approach can be very successful, and I wonder if it 
is due to very restricted view of life that the military have?  
Characters only need to learn to act as soldiers, with very limited 
exploration when on leave.  They are spared some of the social 
complexity, and can fall beck on their comrades when it gets tough.  
There is no need for it to be combat oriented; provided the GM is ready 
to explain the consequences of violence in public places they can be lead 
gently into all the areas that they need to pick up ahead of later, more 
complex campaigns.  When it is over, the role player has a character to 
call on, and is now hooked by the world of Tekumel.

[Moderator's Note:  David Cheng asks the following of the professor.   ]

Professor Barker, we're all grateful for your contributions to the
mailing list here.  We eagerly anticipate future product releases, 
and sometimes you drop hints as to what they might be.  I was 
wondering if you could share with us your personal "priority list"?
What things are _you_ working on these days, if anything?  And, 
just as importantly, in what order do you think they'll appear?
The _Lords of Tsamra_ novel is mentioned sometimes; is this a 
current active project for you?  Or, are other items more interesting
to you right now?

Thanks.

[And the Professor's Reply                                             ]

Dear David,

I don't really have a fixed list of "priorities." Now that the roleplaying 
module is out, and the other modules (e.g. the bestiary) are in print, I am 
turning my attention to more cultural/historical/linguistic things. As you may 
know, I just finished a 64-page booklet on the Sunuz language (used by the 
devotees of the Pariah Deities), together with its spells and rather horrid 
philosophy. I have a Livyani grammar and a Yan Koryani grammar, a couple of 
shortish articles on other topics, and a LOT of unfinished projects (like 
putting all of my boxes and boxes of character cards onto Filemaker Pro -- some 
are on, but others remain to be done).

I haven't worked on the novel for a long time, largely because I was working on 
the rules module -- and also because, frnakly, I was not very happy with the 
novel itself. My players who read it really "flamed" me up one side and down the
other because it was not as well written as the previous two, and nobody liked 
the current hero. I am still planning to rewrite it, and maybe now that the 
rules are done (for now!), I'll get back to it. Or maye I'll go write a treatise
on the Engsvanyali...

I wish I could do more and do it faster, but I am no longer young or as spry as 
I used to be! Being retired helps, but getting the energy to start a new project
seems to be harder and harder these days. But don't count me out quite yet! I 
still have a book or two in me.

Best regards.

>that's another story...)

This is the text of a little hand out that was given to a player who 
insisted on being an Ahoggya.   Partly because they made it clear that 
intended to try to make some sort of super-character out of their choice. 
 (Perhaps they had read the combat and physical statistics, but little of 
the social or practical matters).

>I have always warned players that this is NOT a fun thing to be, in spite of 
>the Ahoggya;s great strength. On Tekumel the goal is to achieve SOCIAL status 
>and power -- not to be Mr. Musclebound Superhero!

So why are Ahoggya smelly, stupid, violent and wierd [sp. "weird" is correct.]

The following is a summary of the translation of the research notes of 
the Tinaliya family-hive of Tkit tlin tisisiti.  It dates from several 
hundred generations before the current game time.
 
>The name of the Tinaliya "hive" (= underground city?) is incorrect. It 
>should be Tkit Tlinet Ses Ti, which one Tinaliya told me meant "Why do 
>you care what we call it?" How did this author get the nice accents, 
>umlauts, etc.? Why can't we do this on our (American?) machines?

It is believed that they captured a family of Ahoggya by the simple 
expedient of drugging a huge pile of fruit and fish heads which they left 
on a raft moored near an Ahoggya village.  How they carried the captives 
back into the nest, and what they used to restrain them is unknown.
The Tinaliya carried out their experiments over a period of three years, 
utilising all of the charges in a rare eye of healing that had been 
tuned 

>What an interesting use of umlauts and accents! How did he do it?
[Moderator's Note:  My text file doesn't show the accents.  Sorry.  I have  ]
[                   had to remove the characters.                           ]

to Ahoggya.  The results were encrypted in the form of gel matrix 
that could only be understood by specially bred messenger clones and then 
passed on to other hives.  With the loss of this particular caste of hive 
member the knowledge was lost.  The knowledge matrix has been resting in 
the archives for millennia, and will, by now, have mainly decayed beyond 
recovery.  Fortunately some of it has been recovered and passed to a 
human scholar.

The huge text of the research covers all aspects of Ahoggya behaviour, 
physiology, metabolism and anatomy.  It was not able to cover the 
reproductive behaviour of the Ahoggya, although some direct field 
observations were appended.  (One suspects that it is easier, and safer 
to observe Ahoggya from under a densely foliated bush if one is about a 
metre tall).

>..Or else from a GREAT distance ...!

One of the fundamental points addressed was the reason for the slow but 
steady collapse of Ahoggya civilisation in the period since the times of 
darkness.  From a space faring species to a barely sentient swamp 
dwelling race of mercenaries.  There was considerable dispute as to 
whether the collapse was genuine, or the Ahoggya were trying to 
perpetrate some form of deception on the other races.

The Tinaliya concluded that the observed facts were congruent with a 
loss of lower brain function.  Viral, bacterial and fungal disease were 
ruled out at an early stage, so, in the slow, methodical manner of the 
Tinaliya, they began a series of delicate vivisections and biochemical 
experiments...

>Here things get a little too "modern-scientific" for anybody on Tekumel. 
>Even the Tinaliya don't know that much about biochemistry. So much was 
>lost during the Latter Times...!
 
It is widely known that the Ahoggya have four large areas of nerve tissue 
that are loosely referred to as brains

>Cute!

Each of these is capable of 
acting in an independent manner, and at any one time, the degree of 
dominance of any one brain area will vary according to a complex temporal 
pattern as well as in response to external stimuli.  To put it another 
way, the brains take it in turn to rest, control  mobility, 
communicate, and monitor basal functions such as breathing,  circulation 
and digestion.

>I'm not sure this is correct. But then I am not a extra-terrestrial 
>physiologist either!

As well as the general abilities each brain has a major function.  One 
will be specialise in each of these functions, and will usually be given 
control of a situation that requires its full attention if the current 
brain thinks that the task requires specialist help.  A key example of 
this is the Ahoggya response to surprise combat stimuli whilst it is 
occupied with another task: the creature will initially react in a 
disorganised fashion, but quickly becomes a ferocious and talented 
fighter.

>Possible? Never noticed. The creatures seem rather disorganised most of 
>the time anyhow.

The four areas each have higher functional areas, roughly equivalent to 
the human cerebral cortex, as well as four lower functional areas.  One 
of these areas is a highly specialised segment that carries knotted 
fibrous connections to each of the other four brains.  It is this 
segment that, if compared to the records of the ur-Ahoggya appeared to 
have atrophied in all of the experimental subjects.

>THe Ahoggya were, of course, a major spacefaring race. They probably got 
>their technology from the Pe Choi, however, and they never developed it 
>much beyond the simplest Three Light Drive mechanism. They may also have 
>had help from other races -- no one really knows.

As a consequence of this, there is imperfect co-ordination of the brain 
areas.  To explore this further the Tinaliya used four sorcerers one to 
read each of the brain areas of the last surviving subject (an immature 
specimen).  What they found is not translatable (unless you can read with 
four pairs of eyes simultaneously), but it was felt that the specimen 
exhibited symptoms not unlike schizophrenia in humans.  This co-related 
with the behavioural observations of random violence, inability to 
communicate, and inability to concentrate on problems.

The primary conclusion of a long series of experiments, the details of 
which are not repeated here as they make some of Ebon Bindings seem 
palatable, was that there was some form of long term, or chronic, dietary 
deficiency.  This was tracked down to one a small number of very rare (on 
Tekumel) elements, the most likely being Caesium.

>I am not sure even the Tinaliya can identify trace elements, and Caesium 
>is so rare on Tekumel that I wonder how the Tinaliya even knew of it.

There appeared to be a 
neurological enzymic co-factor linked to this element which was required 
for the efficient function of the junctions between the local brains 
and the connecting fibres.

Other elements were also noted as being required by Ahoggya that are 
almost completely missing on Tekumel, especially Bismuth and Tungsten.  
Sadly they lead to poor dietary efficiency and imperfect nitrogen 
metabolism, further impairing nerve function.  (The excess venting of 
partially nitrogenated compounds leading to a strong smell of decay 
around  adult Ahoggya).

>Good reasoning -- but too complex even for the Tinaliya? This race has 
>some scientific knowledge, of course, but -- well -- hmm...
 
Searches for replacement sources for the missing elements came up with a 
few species of brackish water succulent plants (which the Ahoggya are 
known to collect in the swamps) and the local ores of Copper and 
Manganese.  It was also noted, from a search on the literature of 
previous experiments, that Shen eggs and certain deep sea creatures 
concentrated Caesium in the shells.  No practical use was found for this 
data.

>Interesting. I never knew this.
 
A spin off of the lack of co-ordination of the brain areas was that they 
tended to interfere with each other when attempting magical actions.  
This made it very hard to read their minds or use delicate magical forces 
in their vicinity.  Again this tallied with behavioural observation.

Sadly, for Ahoggya, the deficiency is not reversible in adult life.  If 
the creature does not receive adequate amounts during gestation and 
throughout infant life, the damage is permanent.  There is no mechanism 
in their metabolism to store the element, and any taken is excreted 
rapidly.  There may be a temporary mental hig

>(What?)

if the creature is able 
to ingest large quantities, but this will quickly fade.  It was deduced 
that the element was very common on their home world.

The Tinaliya commented that it was unfortunate that the Ahoggya had 
failed to adapt to the new circumstances, and set up a long term project 
ot observe their decline.  This experiment continued for five hundred 
years, until the results were unequivocal, then it was discontinued.

####
We still had a great deal of fun with the Ahoggya, after all it was young 
and not totally crazy.  They have their uses (moving rocks, scaring 
children, eating people's coins and bashing down doors) but are clearly 
not suited to politics.  Even better, this one had a _reason_ to plague 
any Shen he met; an inexplicable desire to kill them and eat their 
bones...

As said before, the "thicky barbarian off the boat in Jakalla" was a game device
back in the days when other campaigns began in a tavern with no personal or 
cultural backgrounds whatsoever. Any "outdoors" adventures were done by using

another game (what was it called? "Outdoors Adventure?") which was a sort of 
jungle and backpacking game in which the goal was to survive from one waterhole 
to another. "Castles" were built on this game's map, but there was little more 
to the society. Anyway... that's all water under the bridge now.

Good idea, except that Livyanu is a culturally difficult place to "get into." 
The paranoid presence of the Vru'uneb is hard for western Europeans and 
Americans to tolerate (no comment about our current governments and societies, 
please!), and the secretive nature of the Shadow Gods' great temples make it 
hard for players to relate to each other or to their society. It CAN be done, of
course, and it is fun to try a Livyani group. -- Of course, after the great 
Plague that just about wiped out Livyanu in 2356-7 and led to the Mu'ugalavyani 
invasion (and a corresponding Shen incursion in the south), there may not be 
enough left of classical Livyani society to worry about...

Hmm. Sometimes a string of single words connected with conjunctions just fails 
to give the "inclusive" significance wanted, at least to me. Above, where I 
wrote "jungle and backpacking game," it might have been useful to put in 
something like "jungle/survival/backpacking" or something similar to give a 
stronger idea of what the game was about. However, no quibbles from me -- an old
college professor who has had to learn that "like" and "go" mean "say": e.g. "So
I'm like, 'Great, let's book!" or "So I go, "What's it to you?" Language 
changes, and whenever I utter mild cries of consternation, one of my players 
will invariably ask, "Yes, and who was Pharoah in your day?"

We often play "hostile" factions on the same mission, but my players and I are 
VERY careful not to let this escalate into violence. We always find some excuse 
to keep things civil. Why? Because the adventure itself is more fun -- we think 
-- than croaking each other...

Sounds good. I did a similar sort of scenario in "Flamesong." The difficulty is 
only that these people need further social and political skills in order to get 
the most out of Tekumel. Hanging out in Fort Zinderneuf on the Milumanayani 
frontier gets you very little besides hot, grumpy, and killed.

We've also introduced characters in one of the remote monasteries that dot the 
northern and eastern mountain frontiers of Tsolyanu. We have tried Salarvyani 
warriors serving one of the city-states (Koyluga), and also a party of Yan 
Koryani infilitrators, but, oddly enough, we've never done Mu'ugalavyani. A 
secret cell of Pariah God worshippers might be entertaining, too. Because of 
their alienness, no one has ever volunteered to run a group of Hluss or Ssu 
characters -- they'd be so limited that playing them for more than an evening or
two would be difficult.

Grab whatever works for you group and run with it -- old Tsolyani washerwomen, 
palace chamberlains out for a picnic, Tinaliya merchants sailing on a Shen ship 
to explore the lands of the Naqsai...

Yes, I have one. I am putting the finishing touches on it this weekend. I
could post it to the ftp site(?) if you like. There really are a number of
charming spots to visit in Penom -- I recommend the Dome of the Sweeping
Sea, Garden of Amber Twilight, and the Villa of Copper Stairs (just outside
of the city along the coastline). Do try to avoid the harbor area, though.

So here's someone DEFENDING the barbarian-off-the-boat approach. Chuck's 
arguments are interesting, but some who want to get into the complexities of the
world faster may not want to go through all of the necessary cultural learning-
process.

All true. Tekumel probably focusses more on language(s) than any other 
roleplaying game. Just pronouncing Tsolyani names is hard enough! What if you 
had to learn five or six completely different languages in order to do business 
-- like merchants in Bombay, who must be able to function easily in Hindi, 
English, Marathi, Gujerati, perhaps Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, or even Malayalmm? 
Little kids in the bazaars there know enough to get along in two or three 
languages. On Tekumel the language clues to status, clan, provenience, etc. are 
all quite crucial to social behaviour.

My players are used to being dragged off by the Hand of Fate. Some players don't
enjoy being "controlled," but real life is even worse. At least my "Fate" is 
usually meant to be enjoyable...

Useless header information follows:

I was taking a little walk with my wife the other day.  The two of us
were discussing whether there is any purpose to role playing, or whether
it is a waste of my life.

We planned to cover about 13 miles or so on the South Downs Way in
England.  People have wandered down some of those paths for over a
thousand years, so naturally there is a pub or two to be found.  It was
really hot, about 29C (yes, in England), not a cloud in the sky.

Luncheon was taken at a fine old pub, the Shepherd and Dog.  It consisted
of stilton cheese and a salad.  Refreshment was certainly called for, and
what was called for was two pints of old hazy cider.  This, if you have
never imbided it, is a murky yellow liquid smelling of dangerous ketones,
esters and other wholesome ingredients.  (A Salarvyani would probably use
it to varnish his beard)   Yum, yum; very refreshing.  Time for a little
nap, I said.

Aha!  Yonder is a little flint church circa 1100, with a fine shady and
scented rose bush to lay beneath.  Let the afternoon dozing
begin...zzzzzzzzzz

It is, of course, impossible to remember dreams, but bits of it were
left, and I wrote these down on the back of the map we were using.

End of useless header information.

There was a tall thin man in robes of oily purple (oily, as in the purple
colours moved like oil on water).  He explained to me that Tekumel was a
very important place.

People have lots of things going on in their minds all the time.  There
conciousness is made up of a series of patterns of brain activity that
all compete for resources, and try desperately not to be wiped out by the
inbuilt 'censoring' mechanisms.  These ideas and activities can gang
together to make 'agents', these are patterns of thought that can do
things without needing direct guidance from the rest of the brain (like
playing the piano, driving in the dark, spreading butter on bread).  On
Tekumel magic is harnessed by 'agents' that are placed in the minds of
adepts by sorcerous learning.  Thus someone casting a spell just
'triggers' the agent pattern for that spell.

The thing is, he explained, the spell caster doesn't really know how the
effect is achieved, nor what the true effect is.  OK, you can see or
measure some of the results of magic on Tekumel, but you don't see how it
affects the source of the energy.  Nor do you see what affect it has on
the balance of power between the planes.

There are beings who DO see the whole pattern, and they have very good
reasons to encourage all the sentient races to carry on pouring magical
energy into Tekumel's dimension/plane (oops, used a slash there).

Unfortunately I can't remember who these beings were, or what their
purpose was.

More-over, there was something _really_ important about the languages
that were spoken on Tekumel.  All human languages might come from a root
language, but this is not of any consequence.  However, concious thought
is associated with certain language patterns, and some languages allow
the formation of better 'agents' than others.  (As an example, Japanese
speakers are, apparently, often better at long division than romance
language speakers.)  It is true on Tekumel that some languages allow
better access to magic than others, through their effect on the brain of
the user.

What is really important is that the 'gods' on Tekumel have manipulated
the minds of the beings who worship them, by encouraging the use of
special languages.  This has made the majority of races compliant in the
greater scheme of things, unaware of the huge forces ranged around them.
Or, the gods have colectively discouraged  (as in discouraged spelled
k-i-l-l-e-d)  any race that has come close to a language that would give
access to magical ability without the control of a 'god'.

This hypothetical language would make the speaker like a god.  If his
brain could take the strain.  It would enable access to enormously
powerful magics.  It could de-stabilise the whole of the
pocket-dimension.  It would be neither 'good', nor 'evil'.  There may be
more than one such language.  It would probably be based on some sort of
fractal compression of a tone language, enabling fantastically complex
ideas to be encoded into a few syllables.  Even a rudimentary grasp of
this language would render the speaker wholly insane by current
standards, and may even kill them.  (tsk, no chance of a player character
finding it then...)

Hmm, what did happen to the Livyani?  Why was Ksarul imprisoned, and what
is special about the secret Ksarul temple language?  What if a human
could learn Ssu?  Is this why the 'pariah' languages are considered so
evil of themselves, even if one is not a worshipper?

As a parting message, I was supposed to consider what would happen to a
Universe where the true language of the gods was learned by a sentient
race, and Tekumel came back 'through the curtain'....

Then he went away.

So.  Is it true that the languages are the most important thing on
Tekumel?
Which languages do the 'demons' speak?
Is there a definitive 'family tree' of ALL languages, past and present,
for all races?
Are the tone based languages going to dominate?
Can sentient beings compress speach, say using fractal algorithms, or is
this something that only a computer can do?

My own interpretation of Tekumel "magic" is more technological than 
"religious" or "sorcerous" or "thaumaturgical," or whatever term you 
wish to use. I see "magic" as pulling energy through the "skin of reality" 
into Tekumel's Plane, where it is "moulded" ("shaped," transformed" -- ?) 
into substance or other kinds of energy by mental "gestalts" or "mind-sets" 
rather like computer programmes. One learns these as a student in the 
temples, practices until they become absolutely rote, then pulls them up 
with key words, gestures, and mental conceptualisations. More complex spells 
require more actions, vocalisations, and the like, including "props" like 
incense, candles, and diagammes (probably other items would do, but these 
are traditional in the temples).

He's right. We always see the Planes Beyond as separate "places," occupied 
by energy and matter in the same way our Plane is. But the "power" for 
"magic" seems to come from the "In-Between Spaces," where there is nothing 
but inchoate energy. Spells are minor enough that they do not seem to 
affect the power from Beyond, either in quantity or quality. The "balance" 
might thus take a LOT of spell-use to disturb.

The Pariah Deities? They'd like to create "holes" in Tekumel's "Skin of 
Reality" where they can enter.

I'm not sure the Japanese example is for real. There are many cultural 
factors involved. Remember, we used to say that Spanish is the language 
of passion, French the language of romance, German the language of science, 
etc. etc. These are all based on cultural "perceptions," rather than any 
underlying linguistic differences. There ARE basic perceptual differences, 
of course, as Benjamin Lee Whorf proposed. But if true, then we can only 
express our perceptions in categories already conditioned by our languages
-- and hence we can never express ideas that are not already "expressible" 
in our linguistic matrices! I once did a grammar, dictionary, and texts of 
the Klamath language of southwestern Oregon; it has "singular" and "plural" 
categories for people but not for objects or animals. Instead, it has a 
"distributive" mechanism: a rock or pile of rocks in the same place is 
_singular_, but rocks spread about here and there (physically or temporally, 
in the speaker's perception) are seen as "distributive." Klamath also has 
pre-verbs that one must use to speak of different shape-categories: e.g. 
"to give a long object" (a stick) is different from "to give a round object" 
(a ball or rock),  from "to give a living object" (a baby), from "to give 
a flat oject" (piece of paper), etc. etc. There are about 100 of these 
shape-morphemes, and they combine with locational elements: e.g. "to put 
a flat object on top," "put a flat object into water," "put a flat object 
into fire," "put a flat object underneath," etc. It would e hard to imagine 
Aristotle's logic in Klamath!

Curious idea. I'll have to ask some of my Tsolyani consultants and see 
what they think. This may be true of the languages of the Pariah Deities, 
but I doubt whether Tsolyani or the rest of humanity's many tongues would 
be god-imposed.

There is no "good" or "evil" in Tekumel's conceptualisations anyway.

I don't see tone languages as necessarily able to encode more complex 
ideas in shorter space than non-tone languages. Chinese does come to 
mind, but can a Chinese really express complex ideas faster, or in greater
number, or more delicately than an English speaker? The most complex 
tone languages (e.g. Trique, in Mexico, with four separate pitch levels, 
and rises and falls from any of these to any of the others), are not 
really intellectually or religiously -- or any other way -- more complex 
than non-tone languages such as English, French, or German.

>Hmm, what did happen to the Livyani?

Llyani, or Livyani? The downfall of the former seems to have been local 
societal change, plus the advent of the Dragon Lords. The latter almost 
bought it last year because of the spread of the great Plague.

>Why was Ksarul imprisoned, and what 
>is special about the secret Ksarul temple language? 

Mythology. Your interpretation is as good as mine. As for the Secret 
Tongue, it may be just a means of keeping doctrines and dogma out of 
the hands of other temple hierarchies.

>What if a human could learn Ssu? 

Neither vocal apparatus nor the mental processes seem to allow this. Not one 
single case has ever been recorded.

>if one is not a worshipper?

"Evil" is -- again -- a concept hard to explain on Tekumel, which does 
not have a "good God" and a "bad god" in human terms. The Pariah Deities 
are not seen as "evil" but just "inimical," just as a pit-viper is inimical.
The viper thinks it's doing the right thing!

>So.  Is it true that the languages are the most important thing on 
>Tekumel?

I'd say that the languages are indeed important. "Most" may be a bit too 
much, however.

>Which languages do the 'demons' speak?

Dunno. Most of these creatures have languages of their own on their own 
Planes, and many of the greater ones have no problems "speaking" to humans 
telepathically or through some other unknown mechanism.

>Is there a definitive 'family tree' of ALL languages, past and present, 
>for all races?

If you take the idea that all human beings really do spring from one 
ancient ancestor, then all languages are logically descended from the 
tongue that urancestor spoke. Who knows?

>Are the tone based languages going to dominate?

The Chinese would appreciate a "yes"; the Japanese (a non-tone language) 
might like a "no." I tend to doubt it. There are instances of non-tone 
languages developing from tonal languages, and vice-versa (e.g. Panjabi, 
which has a couple of tones that its parent -- Middle Indic -- did not 
have, and which its close relative, Hindi, doesn't have today).

This question is quite beyond my expertise. Anybody else?

This is a tough act to follow!
[Agreed!]

[Moderator's Note:  David Bailey writes the following about his previous ]
[                   post on magic and languages.                         ]

Thanks for the consideration guys, it is just great to be able develop 
ideas with a like minded group instead of in isolation.  I have managed to 
get all the old 'Digest' postings and am now after the ftp sites (lock up 
your computers, a newbie is coming) 

The language idea has really got under my skin now.

I intend to develop this theme along the lines that the secret languages of 
Duruob, Ai Chi, Sunuz, and the Toungue of the Priest of Ksarul act like a 
bit of a 'mental virus' and cause ideas and behaviours to take root in the 
brain of the speaker.  (Greg Bear had a good story along these lines, 
darned if I can remember the title though).  This will also allow the 
Pariah Gods to take control of their followers and use them as channels 
when the time is ripe... (like leaving an open ip> gateway?).  Only #THEY# 
can know.

I used a few of the ideas in a game yesterday.  Still some work to do 
before I'm happy though.

The players enjoyed reading the 'digests'.  They offer a possible scenario 
for the 'if the egg of the world was made whole' idea, it goes like this:

>The energy of the planes comes from the 'friction' between Tekumel Bubble 
>and normal universe.  If you 'pop' the bubble and survive the surprize 
>ending is...you are way _back_ in time.  That friction comes from running 
against time.  Any one know how far the Ancient Assyrians got with making 
that rescue spaceship.  Tough cookies.  Now where is that map of Mohenjo 
Daro....

[Moderator's Note:  New listmember Darryl Adams adds more to the Starting ]
[                   Characters conversation.                              ]

Thank you for putting me onto the Tekumel mailing list. I have been going 
through the previous mail about starting characters and thought i might 
add my $A0.05 cents in.

As a totally new person to Tekumel (my first module was Dermot Bolton 
running two characters through a solo adventure), I recently got my hands 
on the EPT rules as well as the Tekumel source books and was engrossed by 
the depth of background. 

INMO, you can be swamped by the detail, especially if you play cold (like 
i did), as not only the world is different,but  the moral, social and 
political norms _are_ alien. Playing a member of a high clan is also 
hard, as you have social and political responsibilities which you must 
honor without becoming a social outcast (or worse).

Reading through the EPT rules, the just off the boat is a good concept 
(and as the Professor said, Rome made a habit of appointing barbarians as 
generals at al), but here you miss out on what Tekumel offers, rich 
social and political interaction. (Plus i must add, how would barbarian 
get to join a decent clan?).

One way of getting immersed is to point players into reading Raymond E 
Fiest "Riftwar" and "Tsuani" books. While not true Tekumel, and possible 
derivative to Prof Barker, it is more accessible to the public than Prof 
Barker's books (are thy still in print? Where they ever published by a 
British publisher?[british books are easier to get than US books]). Still 
there is a lot of work to be done to make the players aware of the 
Tekumel way of doing things.

[Moderator's Note:  I have a set of the Professor's books that I have   ]
[earmarked for friends that have extreme troubles getting copies.  I    ]
[visited 3 used bookstores here in St. Louis, and found numerous copies.]
[I suggest that our other friends in the States do the same.  I will    ]
[provide you with the books Darryl.  Email me directly at cld@prin.edu  ]
[for details.  I will begin the trek to other bookstores this week, as  ]
[the first person I did this for wants a 2nd set to give out to his     ]
[players.                                                               ]

Maybe if there was a Tekumel primer book, designed for a player, that 
taught the basics of Tsolyanu culture? Any opinion (or flames, after 
all i may have offended everyone here without knowing it :-)
