These messages are the accumulation of the messages that were sent out on 
the Blue Room email list between May 1995 and June 2000.  A large portion 
of the information is directly from Professor M.A.R Barker. When the list 
members joined during the time the list was active, they agreed to refrain 
from sharing this data with non list members.  When the list ended, it was 
urged that the data be made available to non-list Tekumel fans, and it 
seemed like a good idea all around.

I only ask that if you download these digests, or have received them in 
some other way, please respect the agreements the list members made, and 
refrain from passing them around and instead point people to the Tekumel 
web site, www.tekumel.com so that they can download them for themselves, 
and see all the other material available on the Tekumel.com web site.

Many Thanks.

I don't know about this, but I am a follower of the One Other and He is very
interested in becoming the head honcho of this plane.  But I must say that I
resent Him being numbered among the Pariah Gods.  Is He not one of the
dieties to place a seal on the Doomed Prince's prison?  Is he not the tenth
seal?  (Many seem to think that means he is the least because of it.  HA!)
Are there not many planes where the One Other is, in fact, the sole diety,
and are they not fairly nice people?

Please, if this is some plot to have the Goddess of the Pale Bone enter this
reality, stop it.  And come to the One Other, He is our only hope.

Because they're in the spell list.  I forget whether the spell has the same
name in S&G Vol. 2, but it's called "Vermification" in Gardasiyal, and it's a
Sarku Temple Spell.  The "Worms of the Night" are created by a high-level
variant of the spell.

[Moderator's Note:  Joseph Hooperman adds some info about the crystalline    ]
[                   daggers mentioned in Peter Huston's message.             ]

One of those crystalline, acid- (or whatever-) filled daggers also turned up
in The Man of Gold; it was used by Simanuya the glass-blower/tomb-robber in
the Underworld under Purdimal (chapter 37).

I also had a question:  How many (if any) of the
epics/legends/folk-tales/etc. exist in at least summary form?  I would love
to be able to find out more about the Lament to the Wheel of Black, or to
hear the tales of Subadim the Sorcerer.

[Moderator's Note: Peter Huston asks about human sacrifice and if it was used]
[                  in the times pre-dating Pavar.  My guess is yes, since    ]
[                  Vimuhla was worshipped in pre-Pavar times.                ]

I have a question. It is my understanding that human sacrifice is most
common among peoples without large, valuable draft animals. (The thought
being that people with large animals will sacrifice them instead of their
neighbors, if they feel the need to offer sacrifices to the God (s) .)  On
Tekumel there are some strange wrinkles added. Although the Chlen beasts
are large, there are no riding beasts. (Can the Chlen pull a plow? I
forget. Is there another animal that can do this in its stead?) More
significantly, however, there are beings like Gods who demand the sacrifice
of humans (or at least like the sacrifice of humans.) 

So here's the question, did the religious sacrifice of humans on Tekumal
predate Pavar's contact with the "Gods" or did it began at this time?

[Moderator's Note:  Peter Huston comments on the proto-language question.    ]

I believe its clearly stated in the rules/source books that there was a
common language among the humans who came to Tekumel but it was not English
based. Now, for the record, a common language used for trade is not the
same as a "universal language." I would assume that since humans everywhere
modify language constantly, evolving into accents into dialects into
languages, the humans of 60,000AD probably had quite a few truly
interesting languages and, atomic war or no, I would bet some of these were
descended from English but changed beyond recognition. Seems perhaps some
English speaking folks would've made it in places like South Africa, New
Zealand, Hawaii, wherever, not to mention the acceptance of English as a
useful "common language" in places like the Philippines and India, and
elsewhere. But it is clearly stated that there is a common, non-English
based language among the first humans to settle and visit Tekumel, and that
this was the commonly used language on the space lanes for most purposes.
In fact in the original EPT rulebook it clearly states on p. 107 that "the
Lingua Franca of Humanspace" was a mixture of Tamil, Arabic and Mayan. (I
just looked it up.)

[Moderator's Note:  Gordon Neff comments on the proto-language topic.        ]

"...Thus the combination of ancient and existing languages of Tekumel could
allow
scholars to reconstruct my hypothetical proto-language.

"My question for the Tekumel gurus out there is this: either has this
been done, or were the Tekumel languages designed with this in mind? If
it has been done, I would be very interested in the steps in the
evolution."


Brother Simpson is right-- those are some FAT assumptions regarding
the 'arresting of evolution.' Arthur Clarke was fond of that one, back in
the 1950s: that the invention of sound recording would 'freeze' language at
that point. It has, of course, done no such thing; the recordings change
over time, as listening to 1930s radio shows or films will demonstrate.

As to the Tekumel languages, they were designed by an experienced
linguist. They appear to resemble each other precisely to the extent that
such languages actually would, but they were of course created 'as is,'
rather than as ongoing products of some labor-intensive evolution.

-- Even so, they are immensely refreshing, not to mention engaging:
I had actually made fair progress at learning to speak Tsolyani before more
pressing matters made my life busier. It actually works as a language--
though it's a skull-buster for an English-speaker...

This is such an improvement over these hack-work 'fantasy authors'
who posit non-industrial, low-energy civilizations, yet blithely assume a
global 'universal language,' existing essentially unchanged across
continents and oceans. In thus revealing their own laziness, they leave
conveniently aside the quetion of how this happy state of affairs can exist
without continuous global communication-- if even then...

I must agree with Br'er Simpson in one other matter: Even if the
settlers of Tekumel did speak a common tongue, the staggering span of time
since then renders this a matter of no more importance than whatever
language the Neolithic mammoth-hunters spoke. All such traces have been
swept away: Any presumed 'proto-language' of the Khishan family would be no
less utterly alien than its modern-day descendants.

[Moderator's Note:  Ian Atkinson writes about the genetics question.  While ]
[                   interesting, this is getting more about genetcis than   ]
[                   Tekumel.  If you want to further comment on this topic  ]
[                   let's try to get back to Tekumel.                       ]

I read a while ago in the New Scientist about a survey on birthweights of
children of women who were pregnant during periods of scarcity in the 2nd
world war.  Not surprisingly, the children had low birthweights and
smaller heights at adult age.  Of interest was that *their* children were
also smaller, both at birth and in adulthood.

It is known that in mice developing embryos can "know" whether a gene
comes from the mother or the father: only paternal genes are expressed in
placenta formation.  The likely mechanism here is methylation of genes in
either the egg or the sperm to tag them as having come from a particular
parent. 

It is conceivable that growth & size related genes may also be tagged for
emphasis or de-emphasis during sperm/egg formation to provide a limited
version of Lamarkian feedback from parent to offspring.  Since sperm are
formed during adulthood while the ovaries form eggs while the female is
still in utero this would work differently between the sexes. 

All of this is speculative, but if there's any truth to it then the height
increases seen in current populations are partially due to improvements in
nutrition one or two generations ago and the limits to growth of a really
well nourished human population remain unknown.  Until different racial
groups have all enjoyed western style food supplies for a couple of
generations we have no way of knowing if there are any inherent height
differences between the races.

Uh-uh.  That's the Worms of Death.  The clay coin thing is the T-10 variant
of the spell, but it only imprisons the less dangerous kind of worm.  The T-9
variant creates Worms of Night, which are nastier than Worms of Death.

[Moderator's Note:  Keith Dalluhn responds to the Reality of Tekumel    ]
[                   message.  Very interesting hypotheses Keith.  Sorry ]
[                   to have missed seeing you on Thursday night.        ]

The reality of Tekumel question has been posted before.  I tend to look at 
it in another way.  We all know the tree analogy of Tekumel.  How all the 
planes are like branches of a tree.  Taking this as a given and transfering 
it to our own reality gives us our own tree.

Now, planes of existence have times that travel at different speeds than
the one you are on.  Sanjesh spent 30 years with Pavar studying Thumis, yet
when he came back, it was if only seconds had gone by to the people around
him.   There are also places where it works the other way, you leave and
come back in what for you was a second, but for those aorund you it was
days.

I hypothesize that time moves in waves like light and that there are some
planes that are in synch and those that are out of synch.  There would also
be a third set that is sometimes in synch and sometimes out of synch.  Test
it yourself.  The next time you are in a car at a stop light getting ready
to turn.  Time your turn signal with the guy in front of you.  There are
times when his will match your flashing exactly, but soon the will fall out
of synch only to catch up with each other again.

Given all of this, Tekumel is simply our own plane branched off way far
in the distance and moving in a time synch excedingly faster than our own,
but that is now in synch for a while.  It has advanced to the point to
where Tekumel the game is now.

In gaming with Phil, I have sat in his basement mesmerized as he is
providing descriptions of places or things.  He will actually stop for a
moment, close his eyes and concentrate as if he is reaching through to look
at the item, room or person.  There is also the stuff that happens that is
so inconsequential at one point in time, but that turns around and appears
far later.  Dhichune's talk with Fu shi at the end of man of gold was
nothing untill many years later when Dhichune took the throne.  I also
offer the following:

This is a message I sent out to the group that plays at Phil's.  A little
history is necessary.  The plot we are involved in now revolves aroung the
Mu'ugalavyani using these large stones in patterns around cities to
effectively negate all but the most powerful magics.  Our attempts to
destroy these stones have been fairly fruitless.  Bob Alberti and I were
looking through the Book of Ebon Bindings to see if anyone in there would
be helpful.  I started fumbling though the old Tekumel journals and hit on
the paragraph quoted below.  Soon things started falling in place.  You
have to remember, the Journal article was written *22* years ago, and a guy
who gets about 3 column inches of type has plotted the whole invasion of
Salarvya.  There is no way that Phil could have dreamed this up 22 years
ago and just drug it out now.

Here is the message:

This is going out to the Thursday night group.

We must first start wayyyyyyyy back in time to the Dragon Warriors.

The dragon warriors were the fiercest warriors that Tekumel had ever seen.
They ruled over one of the largest empires ever known.  It was during this
time that Vimuhla showed his face and the Dragon warriors began the worship 
of him.  Even their shaman were powerful.

Now, move forward a few years.  To Queen Nayari.  More commonly known as
the Bednalljan times.  She was able to plot, and sleep her way to the top.
Once there she wasted no time in securing her place in history.  It is said
that her husband was "cast into the sealed shrine of the goddess of the
pale bone in the labyrinths beneath Jakalla."  She also sent armies to
conquer Mu'ugalavya; where the last remnants of the dragon kings, the princes
of Muugalavya were "gobbled up like grain thrown before fowl."

My guess is that she employed the stones given to her by the pariah deities
to negate whatever power was left to the Dragon Warriors.

But what does this have to do with today?


I quote from the first Tekumel Journal, published in 1977:

One of the most respected scholars on the temple of Thumis is the high
scholar Visarga Kuyumaenish a man of about 75 years of age who dwells at
the temple of Thumis in Ssa'atis in Mu'ugalavya.  As his name indicates he is
of Muugalavyani descent.  His field is history, particularly that of the
Bednalljan period, and his scholarship is famed throughout the human lands
of Tekumel.  He is uninterested in doctrinal disputes and has little
patience for anything but his chosen field.  He began as a soldier in the
Mu'ugalavyani army many years ago and took an interest in the priesthood
only after he had attained the rank of Colonel.  He then studied history
and travelled to a great many sites in several countries.  His skill at
identifying and using ancient artifacts is legendary, and scholars flock to
his lectures in the Hall of the Four Niches in the red palace in Ssa'atis.


My Hypothesis:


This bastard stumbled across some ancient text that described how Nayari
used the stones against Mu'ugalavya during her reign.  Being a general he
seized the opportunity to regain the power they had during the time of the
dragon warriors.  If you read about the dragon warriors they took over
Mu'ugalavya first, then moved south to the shen lands before turning east
into Tsolyanu.  The exact same plan that is now going on.  His "travels to
a great many sites in many countries" was probably nothing more than a
scouting mission to find the best places to lay the stones in each of those
countries.  And to seal it up further, why would a colonel of a
Mu'ugalavyani army turn suddenly to a worshiper of a "peaceful" faith from
an entirely different country?  My guess is that he needed the guise to
travel freely and use the libraries because a worshipper of the goddess
would be allowed neither!

All of this firmly ensconces me into the realm of people who believe that
Tekumel does exist and Phil simply channels things through.  There is no
way that this stuff could be an accident, and no way that a simple
paragraph about a guy written 22 years ago could somehow just happen to
come back like this.

-Keith the slightly terrified.

You can take all of this or leave it.  These are just my thoughts.  Scary
as they may be.

[Moderator's Note:  Michael Schwartz sends an anonymous treatise on     ]
[                   Chaigari.  If you wrote it, stand up and take a bow.]

Hey folks,

The following is the transcription of a type-written manuscript of unknown
authorship which I found amongst the miscellaneous Tekumel materials in
the collection of my friend, Michael Trout. I post it here, complete and
more or less unaltered... I made spelling corrections and removed all
"crossed-out" characters only.

It is obviously based on EPT-era "Tekumel reality", as the borders of
Chaigari then included Hekellu. Some facts herein also contradicts
material written by Andrew Lorince, who was appointed Governor of Fenul by
the Professor at some point in the early- to mid-80s... specifically the
mention of the lack of iron mines in the region.

If the author is still active in Tekumel circles, please come forward and
take credit for this excellent short work.

----------

[NOTE TO MY PLAYERS: The material herein should not be considered hard
fact, as far as our campaign is concerned. An "updated" document will be
provided to you  which will better jibe with the more recent "facts" I
have uncovered.]

----------

A Description of Chaigari Protectorate


1. Geography

Two main terrain features dominate Chaigari protectorate, Kakri Midallu
peak and its surrounding ranges, and the Kanayagari River.

Kakri Midallu is the youngest of the three major mountain ranges in the
vicinity, the others being Tlani Hidallu peak and the oldest being the
Chayengar range. All of these ranges have been caused by the collision of
the Salarvyani continent with that containing Tsolyanu.

Even though Tekumel lacks the uranium in its core which keeps the Earth's
core fluid, its larger size led to a greater release of gravitational
energy when it collapsed to provide a much larger fluid core with a longer
cooling time. That plus the larger energy it received from its sun (until
recently by geological time) have combined to give Tekumel a fluid core
and a plastic mantle. This leads to volcanoes, earthquakes, and
continental drift. Since continents are more common than oceans on
Tekumel, continent-continent collisions are more common than
continent-ocean collisions.

Continent-continent collisions are spectacular. The Himalyas of northern
India are the product of a continent-continent collision and are the
highest mountains on Earth. Lake Baikal in the Soviet Union sits in a hole
caused by a fault resulting from that collision, even though it is over
1500 km away from the point of impact. In this case, the
Tsolyani-Salarvyani continent moving north collided with the eastward
moving Yan Koryani-Jannuvyani continent. In the Chaigari region the
initial impact created a series of east-west trending overthrusts which
flung up the Chayengar range and another series of ranges south of it. The
Kanayagari river runs in a gap between these ranges. After the initial
collision, the Salarvyani portion of the continent rotated first one way,
flinging up a series of northeast-southwest trending overthrusts on top of
the east-west ones, and then the other throwing up more overthrusts in the
northwest-southeast direction. Where these secondary overthrusts
overlapped the original east-west overthrusts, mountains were piled on top
of mountains. The results are the spectacular Tlani Hidallu and Kakri
Midallu peaks. In the course of all of this, the 10 km thick continental
crust of Salarvya was shortened by a hundred kilometers. All of that rock
went up.

The other major geographic influence on the Chaigari is the Kanayagari
river. For the best part of 50 million years there has been a Kanayagari
river winding back and forth across its valley, working and reworking it.
The valley is broad, flat, and steep-walled with a thick soil layer
regularly recharged with fresh loam eroded from the mountains and brought
down by fast flowing streams.


2. Geology

The mountains immediately north and south of the Kanayagari river are the
oldest and hence the most eroded in the region. In some cases only the
metamorphosed core of the original mountain remains, yielding marble,
slate, and a few heat produced gem stones. In other places, whole cliff
faces of sandstone and limestone present themselves for easy quarrying for
building materials.

A type of coal can also be found, but it is purplish in colour and
extremely malodorous. Any who can afford to use charcoal. Seeps of oil are
also found here and there in the Chaigari, but this is particularly nasty
stuff, evil smelling and extremely corrosive. Areas around such pools are
devoid of normal life, although Food of the Ssu can be found growing
there, and any who fall into such a pool could well find it the most
unpleasant experience of their rapidly diminishing lives.


3. Agriculture

The broad, rich valley of the Kanayagari is somewhat cooler than the dusty
plains of the Imperium and although Dna grain is cultivated, harder grains
such as wheat are more common here. As well, many specialty fruits and
vegetables not commonly available in the Imperium are available here, but
the reverse is also true.

High quality Ngalu fruit does not flourish here and therefore the Chaigari
produces little decent wine with the possible exception of Fenul. Some of
its berry concoctions are drinkable and mildly amusing to the connoisseur.
Those who can afford to, import wine. Hekellu is somewhat well-known,
however for the quality of both its wheat and barley beers.

Chaigari is chiefly known for its animal husbandry and land too poor to
grow crops is used to graze the huge herds of chlen, hma, and hmelu, chlen
at the lowest and hmelu at the highest. Final fattening of animals is
often done at the lower elevations in recently harvested fields or fields
allowed to lie fallow. This also helps enrich the fields.


4. Ethnicity

Chaigari protectorate was conquered from the Salarvyani a little over
three hundred years ago and many of its citizens claim Salarvyani descent.
Most of these live in and around the town of Fenul. Since the conquest
there has been a steady stream of political refugees and more recently
refugees from ssu activities. Also some wealthier Salarvyani choose to
reside in Fenul owing to the lower and more consistent Tsolyani tax
structure.

Hekellu contains few Salarvyani, by contrast. Hekellu was rather badly
damaged during the conquest and since it was already long overdue for
Ditlana, the town was leveled and built anew. Many of the Salarvyani left
at this time and were replaced by Tsolyani. Tsolyani had been colonizing
the area for some time prior to the conquest in any case. Today only the
lake fishing clans and some of the merchant clans claim direct Salarvyani
descent, and even these people appear to be Tsolyani due to intermarriage.

Tsolyani form most of the population of Hekellu with the exceptions noted
above and except for some native menials. Tsolyani also dominate, if not
form the majority of the population of the area around Hekellu and the
Kanayagari river as far east as the big bend. These areas have been
heavily colonized by agricultural clans from Ferinara and Sokatis.

Of the Tsolyani in Hekellu, most are from eastern based clans of scribes
and officials and also merchant and transportation clans. Tsolyani in
Chaigari average 1-2 cm taller than their cousins in the Imperium owing to
a diet higher in protein.

Most of the mountainous areas and portions of the river valley are
populated by indigenous Chaigari tribesmen. These people owe a great deal
ethnically to the Kilillamuyani and Jannuvyani stock. Short and of wiry
build, they are poor agriculturalists, being at best subsistence level
farmers. They are far better herdsmen, hunters and mountaineers. Lately
they have been used as miners and quarrymen. Although their small stature
suits them to mining, their light builds do not. There are better miners
to be found elsewhere in the Imperium and some of these have begun moving
into the area.

Their language has been identified as a dialect of Jannuvyani, but has
borrowed a great deal from Tsolyani and Salarvyani. Because they tend to
be quite insular, large variations in dialect can be found from mountain
valley to mountain valley. In the north and west the Tsolyani influences
dominate and in the south the Salarvyani becomes transcendent. Banditry is
endemic among the tribesmen and while some of this may be attributed to
the Kilillamuyani, the locals make up the bulk of the bandits. Tsolyani
proverb, "A Chaigari herdsman is a bandit who has stolen many animals."


5. Economy

The Chaigari has several major industries and it depends on the year which
is the largest income earner. Mining and quarrying are the largest
industries in most years, however. In various places may be found tin,
lead, zinc, silver, and gold. While almost no iron production exists in
Chaigari, iron is found in western Kilillamu and southeastern Milumanaya
and a lot of ore finds its way to Hekellu. Most ores are concentrated in
Hekellu for trans-shipment to the larger centers but there is a small
domestic steel industry which supplies Hekellu armourers.

Many gems and semi-precious stones are also brought out of the mountains.
Jadeite, lapis lazuli, agate, carnellian, tiger eye, amethyst, and quartz
are found in abundance. Opals, rubies, emeralds, garnets, diamonds, and
sapphires are also found. An ornamental quartz called a Chaigar is
peculiar to the foothills of Kakri Midallu peak and is found nowhere else
in the world. The rich translucent brown variety and the dark blue variety
with pale veining are the most valuable. The pale blue, yellow, and purple
varieties are too close in appearance to other types of ornamental quartz
found elsewhere to be as valuable.

The Chaigari and surrounding area produce abundant building quality stone.
Limestone, sandstone, and slate are so common that kiln-dried brick is
rare in Hekellu and sundried brick is found as a temporary building
material or in some of the river side villages. Even many of the poor live
in sandstone buildings with slate roofs. The buildings of the rich, the
temples, and the major public buildings are commonly faced with fine
limestone and rich marbles. Gneiss and schist are also found and inlays of
agate, quartz, and lapis lazuli are also seen. Basalt and granite are not
to be found as the nearest sources are in the Hundranu Rise outside of
Sokatis. Hekellu therefore presents a pleasing facade of red, pink, white,
cream, grey, blue, and even black buildings with grey slate roofs. Ample
supplies of sand, gravel, and limestone have also led to a thriving cement
and concrete industry. Much of the stone for export is at least rough
dressed in Hekellu or Fenul and thus the masonry clans are quite powerful
in both towns.

The next leading export is meat. Huge herds of hmelu and hma roam the
rough ground and foothills of Chaigari. Hekellu and Fenul both have
packing industries, Hekellu for shipping to the Imperium and Fenul to
Salarvya. Animals for export are slaughtered in the late fall to early
spring in order that they may be shipped in cooler weather. They are
usually lightly salted or smoked for preservation, but not heavily so as
salt or wood for smoking both have to be imported.

In addition, the higher reaches of the mountains contain game animals,
such as Tsi'il, which are hunted for their meat. Most such game is exported
to places like Fasiltum where it is served at the feasts of the wealthy.
It is considerably cheaper in Hekellu and it is a rare middle-class feast
there where it is not included.

Chaigari is also known for the quality of its chlen beasts. Most of these
are peeled in situ but poorer armour producers are shipped out loaded as
beasts of burden and sold at their destinations along with their cargoes.
Some of the hides are merely treated to preserve them and shipped while
others are turned into finished products in Hekellu and Fenul. There are
thus several thriving armourer's clans in both towns and those in Hekellu
also make some steel armour on occasion with iron ore from Kilillamu.

Farming is mostly for domestic consumption and in fact dna grain often has
to be brought in from Ferinara to meet needs, due to the shorter growing
season and the shortage of arable land. Wheat and other rare hard grains
are more common here and many of these are exported for specialty baking.
The higher unit value of these grains usually means a net profit for
Chaigari in most years.

Fishing is also worthy of note. Lake Kanayagara produces several species
of edible fish, mostly for domestic consumption. The mountain streams also
produce some excellent eating fish, although not in significant quantity.
There are also several species of shellfish to be found in the lake and
streams and these are considered gourmet delicacies. They are caught and
rushed live in tanks of water to Sokatis and Fasiltum to grace the tables
of the truly wealthy. Additionally, there is a species of bottom dwelling
fish in the lake which can be jigged for. While the fish itself is
virtually inedible, in the fall the female produces a roe which commands a
fancy price indeed at the tables of the very wealthy (up to 50K per kg in
Fasiltum, more elsewhere). The fish can get up to 6 m in length and a
single female can produce up to 10 kg of roe. However, a single fisherman
is lucky indeed if he gets more than a bite or two in a season. They fight
hard once hooked, struggling for hours or even days, and frequently escape
or sink the boat and eat the fisherman. Even when a catch has been boated
it is a male as often as not. There is even a small chance that a female
has already laid her eggs.

Although there are occasional woods and forested areas in the mountains,
all hardwoods must be imported. The softwood forests of the Chaigari do
produce some tall straight spars which are rafted down the river to
Jakalla to make masts. These are superior to the usual hardwood masts
because they do not require splicing to make a full mast and their lighter
weight leaves the vessel lighter and less top heavy.

Another Chaigari revenue earner is trade, between Tsolyanu and Salarvya in
Fenul and Hekellu and between Tsolyanu and the states of the northeast in
Hekellu. Hekellu is the effective head of navigation of the river for
large barges and hence serves as headquarters for large numbers of
carters, bargemen's, and mercantile clans. One clan is able through a clan
secret to produce ice, even in summer. It is they who ship roe and other
valuable perishables by refrigerating them. The price is very high,
however, and the process is dangerous and leads to periodic damage by fire
or explosion to the clan house.

I'm not sure it physical changes are that likely, at least nothing that is
not reflected in current human diversity, or would suggest a new
subspecies. Fossil evidence suggests that modern Homo sapiens has existed
for c. 500,000 years.  Of course, if the nuclear war radically altered the

I think the Sourcebook says that the primary ethnic groups surviving the
war were Arabic, Maya, and Tamil speakers.  Given such a melange to start
with, and 60,000 years pre Cataclysm and c. 25,000 after, I think you are
right, it would be very difficult to associate current Tekumelyani
languages with anything we are familiar with in our time.

There is a conflict between sources.  Deeds of the Ever-Glorious does
indeed say that that most members of the Legion worship Belkhanu, and that
the Legion is never known for its sadism or violence.  Mitlanyal however
lists the Legion of Ketl as one of the military units associated with
Chiteng, and describes it as "Prison guards sponsored largely by the
Temple of Chiteng, but including members of all faiths".  

Perhaps we could get a clarification?

[Moderator's Note:  James Maliszewski asks about the He'esa.

Forgive my ignorance, but what exactly are the he'esa? I understand that =
they are servants of She Who Is Not to Be Named, but know little else. =
Any information would be appreciated.

Thanks,
James

Here's how I understand it.  The He'esa are things that somehow inhabit a
person (I don't know if the victim was willing, or unwilling.)  I imagine
they behave something like the keepers on Babylon 5 (if you watch it).  
Except they probably live within the host.  They could be purely physical
or purely magical beings, I am not sure which.  They control and/or keep 
the host in line and cause him to do the will of the Goddess.  When the 
Man of Gold was activated, it seems that the strings that tied the He'esa 
to this plane were cut, the He'esa either died or went back to the plane 
they came from and left a disgusting puddle where the host once was.

If I goobered up that description, I am sure that someone from the Thursday
night group will correct me.

mature gamers
if you are wondering what to do with all that tekumel role-playing
info you've accumulated try what i've been working on. i've taken all
the characters i've generated and those sent to me in dispatches as
well as dispatches sent to the various tekumel fanzines and any
responses received plus lots of other material and am combining it
into a Fenul book. i figure with a city population of 100-200 thousand
and at least one or two million in the rest of chaigari and adjacent
areas there is a place for almost everyone.
or you might consider approaching gaming or sf cons and offer to run
demo games or just find an area there spread out your tekumel books
and see what develops. i met a tlakotani princess who played in Prof
Barker's campaign this way. i have a standing policy that at any of
these cons where i can find two players at the same time i will run a
game. I am scheduled to run tekumel miniature events at UCON and
possibly a role-playing event.

language
from what i've seen the increase in communication speed has caused
english to change much more rapidly. just look at the acronyms that
have come into everyday use in the media, conversations and on the web.

politics
i know that we here in fenul and surrounds have been in a dimensional
warp of sorts since hirkane passed on. we get some information in but
can't get anything out. when did mirusiya replace dhich'une and is
eselne dead or alive? by the way how could somebody out here in the
boondocks identify the emperor if someone showed up at the gates naked
and claiming to be hirkane. (he is being well cared for by the temple
of avanthe)

maps
when i started experimenting with tekumel back when EPT first came out
i developed a sysem of sub hexs, on the same scale as the northwest
frontier maps, for determining terrain, resources and sites of
intrest, this method was suitable for use in solitary gaming when a
party was exploring a hex and didn't know what they were looking for.
unfortunatly i lost my masters somewhere between detroit and
pittsburgh, but i still have individual hex info and can regenerate
them again.

food of the ssu
out here in fenul the stuff is everywhere. we know it favors swampy
terrain and spreads like many other weeds. we don't try to destroy it
unless it is a danger to citizens just post the areas and try to avoid
them. no one has ever reported that it was cultivated on the surface
even in ssuyal. we know that the ssu use human slaves to keep patches
clear of our plants, but this is very rare. the only other reference
to a use for it is found in a monograph being prepared for the fenul
book.  it is called "siyuzharin kukurikh hi ahoggyamuonyal lel
charneilikh" by ahoggyamunger hi avanthe 'eshanmolain hi'estadata. he
writes ..."i even identified a ring that harvest food of the ssu,
which the ahoggya favor as a source of a carapace dye which is
pleasing to their eyes, although barely visible to me."...

[Moderator's Note:  Professor Barker comments on the worshippers of the Lords]
[                   of Change.                                               ]

Some clans and lineages traditionally worship one of the Lords of Change.
There are regional preferences and there are economc benefits from having
your own clan deal with another clan worshipping the same deity. For
example, we (my clan) worship Lord Hru'u; we might give a slight
preference, therefore, to another clan worshipping Hru'u or Wuru. We don't
*exclude* non-Change business contacts, but there is just a slight bit of
closeness, rather like a Presbyterian who has a choice of a fellow
Presbyterian or a Methodist.

>>	Despite the enlightening help of the Bob Alberti's "Mitlanyal", I
>>still have a hard time understanding of the roles of some of the Gods of
>>Change.  I understand that the average "Tsolyani on the street" is quite
>>moderate in his/her beliefs and religious intensity,

The average Tsolyani is probably a "time-server": motivated more by daily
humdrum concerns than by religious zeal. But he/she still has an allegiance
to the deity of his clan, or to one chosen by his lineage. Personal choice
has also something to do with this: a somewhat more motivated seeker may
change religious affiliation at will, without much fear of being brought up
on heresy charges. Rather like a Hindu who particularly favours Lord Siva,
but who may shift to Lord Vishnu for a variety of reasons.

>>is hard to understand how some of the Tloquiriqaluyal command the loyalty
>>of more than a relatively small cadre of fanatics and outlaws.  Their
>>driving principles seem too much at odds with the needs of their

>>courage?  Hru'u/Wuru and Vimuhla/Chiteng in particular seem at best to be
>>powers to be appeased and deflected, rather than lords whose attention one
>>might desire.

The gods are not just there to serve humankind and provide "bennies." Clans
do not discuss their overall religious affiliation any more than a
sub-caste of Saivite Hindus convene a debate on their allegiance to their
deity here on Terra. Why, to take another example, did the Phoenicians and
Carthaginians worship Ba'al -- and burn their infants alive in the flaming
stomach-cavity of the divine image? Obviously there were promises of better
profits, happiness, the satisfying of the god's commands, etc. One can see
why deities of Change might appear less than desirable as objects of
worship, but yet it is the habit of humankind to mulishly go right on
serving them!

An individual may indeed change faiths, as noted before. This is not
usually done for reasons of greed, as a "player character" changes faiths
because the spells in god X' list are more destructive and "fun" than in
his/her previous sect. One may change because one's spouse belongs to a
different faith, and there is a natural human tendency to want to please
him/her. (Unlike Terra where we constantly read of marital conflicts
between Protestant and Catholic spouses, or between a Christian husband or
wife and a Jewish partner. ) Individuals also shift faiths in response to
business pressures: e.g. my lineage-family worships Lady Avanthe, but now
we're living in a region almost completely devoted to Vimuhla. Some -- not
all -- of our members may change over for business and social reasons.
There are indeed ideological conversions, but these are comparatively rare.
Most conversions are due to social/economic reasons.

>>	It is even more difficult to understand why rulers have permitted
>>or encouraged their worship.  Hru'u and his cohort in particular seem
>>utterly at odds with goals of Imperial rule.  It is clear that now the
>>Lords of Change are powerful enough that they cannot be eliminated
>>(Empress Shaira Su's withdrawal from the gates of the City of Sarku is a
>>convincing case), but how did they get that way?  And why, today, in the
>>time of the Concordat, are not more Tsolyani "voting with their feet" and
>>worshiping deities who can better provide for them?

Some of the Lords of Change were worshipped *before* Pavar's pantheon came
into being. Some are traditional in certain areas: e.g. Lord Sarku in the
northwestern mountains and in Do Chaka.  As noted above, deities who do not
"better provide for them" are not necessarily seen as useless or weak
deities! What "bennies" does Lord Siva provide that Lord Vishnu does not?
The god of wealth, elephant-headed Ganesh, is a son of Lord Siva, who may
best be chAracterised as a "god of change," versus the "continuing cycles"
focus of the Vaishnava worshippers. No, material "bennies" are not the
answer, ant more than Christianity provides more goodies than Judaism. A
*church* organisation may indeed be more economically or societally
appealing than a synagogue in a particular time and place, but all members
of the latter do not automatically come clamouring to convert!

The answers above are fairly correct and stand by themselves.  People go
with tradition, regional preferences, lineage choices, and personal
intervention by a spouse or other loved one. In a few cases, there may be a
charismatic preacher or leader who stirs up the folks with powerful
speeches, "miracles," or other temptations.

Most folks just go with the flow...

>[Moderator's Note:  Many more wrote in to discuss the old gamers thread.  ]

I read this whole series with approval and some excitement. It is obvious,
now, that "Tekumel will not die with Barker." Some of you will carry on,
whether as a role-playing game (or games), CD-ROMS, novels, etc. etc. This
might have been materially easier if Tekumel had not been so difficult for
American and western European readers: alien creatures, strange history,
unpronounceable languages, customs and religions and political motivations
quite different from ours at present. Any author who introduces a "dragon"
finds quick comprehension and response from his/her readers; one who must
write a page describing an Ahoggya will face a lack of understanding that
may cause readers to drop away out of an unwillingness to go to the trouble
of learning!

There really is no *proper* forum for carrying on Tekumel. All fora (is my
Latin plural correct?) are proper! A story here, a painting there, a
computer game, a role-playing game, a military miniatures game, a card
game, a piece of music -- all have possibilities and interest for some of
us.

Some people may never see the attraction of Tekumel. Some think they have
"outgrown" the "childish" world of role-playing. Some become overwhelmed by
the material cares of this world and slowly drift away. All I can say to
such people is: "Bon voyage!" Enjoy what you enjoy! (A less sympathetic
person might just say, "Love it or leave it!"

Not merely interesting, but -fascinating-. Imagine the appearance
from some modern-day Burton -- in Minneapolis, say-- of a 'Thousand and One
Tsolyani Nights,' telling all the best-remembered tales from the Time Of No
Kings.

That would be... tremendous. (It might also be a lot of fun to -do-.)

[Moderator's Note:  Professor Barker replies to Gordon's comments on maps.  ]

The *idea* of a map (a two-dimensional representation of terrain features,
scaled distances, roads, cities, etc.) just never seems to have taken hold
amongst the picture-minded peoples of the Five Empires.

>>If a "better" map is wanted, the Tsolyani draw a picture: a stylised
>>portrayal of a town, etc., with figures of its residents drawn in here and
>>there; cf. the box cover of the original EPT. As far as I know, there are

>Ah-hah!

>Does the term 'sand table' strike a chord? It's not just the nobles

Commanders normally use verbal descriptions and physical measurements to
plan for battle. There are various records of these, often quite detailed.
If, however, you were to render these as a *drawing,* chances are that
viewers would not comprehend the conventions needed to represent slopes,
hills, rivers, and the like. Instead, the Tsolyani would bring out an
artist who would study the descriptions and construct a visual picture,
often in full colour and embellised with little beings, animals, etc.

I think the custom of mapping fell out of favour back in the Latter Times,
when the practice of "High Cartography" was invented. The ancients had a
means of shaping and engraving a single stone (sometimes a gemstone,
sometimes not) with the physical, cultural, etc. data of the region it
represented. A knowledgeable person could then "read" this "map" by
stroking the stone and letting his fingers feel ther whorls, rises,
depressions, and the like. Later, these stones were invested with
Other-Planar energy, so that one actually "sees" the data in one's head --
rather like watching a National Geographic documentary. Touch a finger to
Livyanu on such a stone, for example, and the viewer sees Tsamra as a
living picture, hears voices telling him details of population, resources,
crops, shipping, and history. This was mentioned in "Man of Gold." With
"maps" like this, who needs paper?

There may indeed be "continental relief maps" among the High Cartography
map-stones kept in the Chancery at avanthar, or in the Library of Prince
Rereshqala near Jakalla. These things are rare and precious, and I myself
have never seen a really elaborate example. Most such map-stones relate
only those data desired by the ancient owner for individual purposes: e.g.
a fancy map-stone (a fist-sized sphere of carnelian) detailing the coast of
southern Tsolyanu for sailing purposes, now sunk beneath the sea since
Ganga went down. This was probably a gift from some wife or sweetheart to
her beloved who happened to enjoy sailing.

>'Course, what happens afterward to such efforts in
>three-dimensional mapping is anyone's guess... including a shrewd
>referee... (Tell -me- it wouldn't auction for a good price!)

Maybe it would sell here. Map-stones of "High Cartography" sell very well
on the antiquities market in Bey Su. One must be careful about fakes, of
course. As for maps, the Tekumelani would probably be interested, though a
little baffled. Moreover, the cultural impetus to *develop* maps and think
in these unfamiliar terms would likely prevent anybody from inventing them!
"Players" themselves cannot make new inventions. There are no "player
characters" on Tekumel. There are only Tekumelani: people who are native to
the cultural life of Tekumel and who think it its terms.  Otherwise we
would have had rockets, gunpowder, toothpaste, and television on Tekumel by
now! These inventions require a western-scientific "mind-set" and cannot be
just "deduced" or "intuited" except very rarely. The Aztecs had wheeled
toys, but they never developed wheeled carts. The Chinese had the wheel and
metallurgy, but they didb't develop the ricksha until some Britisher did it
for them in the 1880's (I think it was). The Maya built gigantic buildings,
but they never seem to have thought of the arch.  Etc.

Sounds reasonable. Except that I had never seen an illustration of Phurba's
daggers. I was, however, drawing illustrations of Tekumelani daggers on the
margins of my school notebooks, even as a chld. I recall one teacher who
thought I was particularly bloody-minded (she was right!!) and wanted to
persuade me to think of *peaceful* things. I countered by drawing a sketch
of a sacrifice to one of Sarku's gooiest demons! For this I caught merry
hell.

Umm. There are religiously-prescribed weapons: e.g.the "silver swords" of
the followers of Karakan. These are used in military rituals within the
temples, and they are handed down from generation to generation as revered
and near-sacred relics.

I loved "The Purple Sapphire.! For years I had a near-complete collection

Rational approach, say I. Players need rules and guidance only until they
can prepare their own scenarios and stand on their own feet (tentacles,
what-have-you). I thus urge  that we aid beginners and those unfamiliar
with Tekumel to the best of our abilities, but that at some point such new
people must become adept enough to devise their own materials for their
campaigns themselves. I myself have enjoyed playing in other people's
Tekumel, as well as in D-n-D games with quite different cultural
parameters.

I think you may be correct. I have never heard of any human or member of
another nonhuman species deliberately trying to grow the Food of the Ssu:
e.g. in a laboratory. The stuff seems to require marshes or fens, deep
jungle,or other "wet" environments. It doesn't even grow in all of these.
Probably some chemical or ingredient combined with environmental factors
such as heat and humidity.

The Ssu are considered horrid and unclean by most humans, and this would
preclude followers of Chiteng and Hrihayal from making use of the stuff.
The Tsolyani deities consider their practices to be "noble"; it would be
very "ignoble" to rub somebody's face in the Food of the Ssu!

Not impossible, but in view of the lack of a rational "scientific" spirit,
this might be unlikely.

Glass-like hollow blades filled with poison are a feared (but not very
useful) assassin's weapon. They have a tendency to break when hit against
something, and woe betide the poor chap who manages to sit on one! Reminds
me of the little glass balls filled with oil that conveniently burst into
flames when lit with a torch and tossed at a monster" in D-n-D.  Real
poisoned daggers exist mostly for "fear" purposes and are sometimes sent to
intended future victims as warnings.

None of the epics exists in English in any form! I am not a very good poet
(in any language), and I also have neither time nor energy to do them as
they should be done. There are also many languages involved -- and also
many recensions, done at different historical periods by different people
with different goals. Some of these just focus on different events (e.g. a
"Vimuhla" version of the "Lament to the Wheel of Black" devotes many verses
to the glories of the Flame, while a Sarku version speaks of the might and
power of that deity (most frequently termed "The Worm with Five Heads" in
the epics). I have never seen a version done for the One Other, although
the Naqsai priests (of the continent off the present maps to the southwest)
insist that there is one). Not every one of Pavar's pantheon has a version,
either; the Cohorts do not, except for Chiteng, Wuru, and Gruganu. These
tend to be like "extracts" from the longer versions used by their
respective deities.

Wish I could help, but...!

[Moderator's Note:  Professor Barker replies to the topic of party mix.   ]

"Party mix" is what we call a bowl of "mixed nuts" where I come from. ???

[Moderator's Note:  If the shoe fits.... :)                               ]

In any case, when one is playing a *game,* a good mix maximises your
chances: for a "stability" party, you need Karakan lads to fight, Avanthe
priests to produce breathable air, Thumis and Ketengku devotees to heal and
analyse things, Hnalla priests to do certain spells, and Belkhanu personnel
to get you safely off across the Planes! The same is true of Change
parties. We have had some parties that were so mixed that they had almost
no central goal, except as the players desired, and they were occasionally
upset by factionalism: e.g. "Arumel's Ecumemical Army," which wandered all
over Milumanaya during the recent war. It had every conceivable sect in it,
including the One Other, the Goddess of the Pale Bone, and so on... We
enjoyed it, but it was a "game" creation; it did not reflect a realistic
picture of how such groups work.

In "real" Tekumel terms, such mixes do not often exist. The Concordat
prohibits members of opposing sects from simply killing one another off,
but there is a lively rivalry to obtain one's ends before the opponents
can.  Members of rival sects, even some that are otherwise on the same
side, may keep secrets, try for objectives not disclosed to the others, and
generally act just a trifle unfairly with the others.

Play these issues as you wish. I know how hard it is to separate "game"
matters from "real Tekumel." People often jump into rivers, engage in a
battle, etc. in order to save another "player character," even when the
latter is a member of s different sect or faction. This is unavoidable, I
suppose. The game itself imposes its own "ethics" upon the group, just as
it is "immoral" for two players of Monopoly to conspire to work together to
defeat one or more opponents or a coalition. The players of D-n-D and
Tekumel have to co-operate in order to keep relations at the gaming table
happy -- and also in order to maximise their chances.

Are you sure you *want* intra-party tension? This can be quite
nerve-wracking. Waiting for character X to knife you in the back, when you
have just saved him from a mob of howling monsters -- this can be
frustrating!

[Moderator's Note:  I said tension, not murder!  :)                           ]

Phil

Carl Brodt's latest catalog lists the Northeastern Frontier maps and

These are described in Swords and Glory Vol. II under Assassin weapons. 
Worms of the Night are kept in clay 'coins'. The coins can be safely 
carried and then broken in an area where the victim will walk, or while 
sleeping. 

Pai'yi's Kiss is filled with acid, prussic, I believe. They are flung by 
staff-sling.

There's also a pistol crossbow similar to the Shen weapon.

[Moderator's Note:  Robert Goldman asks about Mrelu and the Tsolyani     ]
[                   Calendar.                                            ]

I have just begun to play in James Maliszewski's play by web Tekumel campaign.  
Most of the group are members of the temples of Thumis or Ksarul.  Being a 
scholarly fellow myself, I thought it would be interesting to play the role 
of a priest of Gruganu, from Mrelu, Kagesh hi Tukkolen of the Cloak of Azure 
Gems clan.

I have been reading a lot about Tekumel, through the books, this list, etc. 
but it's still been a humbling experience to try to draw up a Tsolyani life 
story!  In particular, I realize that I know next to nothing about Kagesh's 
home city of Mrelu.  Can anyone provide more info?

All I have found so far is a short passage in the Swords & Glory volume I, 
stating that:

"Eastward the bustling  cities of the central plains --- Mrelu, Meku, Katalal, 
Urmish, Usenanu and others --- are devoted to the agricultural bounty of 
their regions --- and to the making of money.  They are flat, neat, solid 
and a little pompous." [p. 34]

One thing I'd love to hear about is the fact that Mrelu is devoted to Lord 
Ksarul and his cohort, Gruganu.  I find that hard to square with the stolid, 
bourgeois feeling of the above description.  How do these worthy burghers 
fit into the temple of Ksarul?  From the description in Mitlanyal, with the 
masked priests and no one knowing who's really a powerful figure, the temple 
of Ksarul sounds like something out of Kafka (The Trial or The Castle, say), 
with the inaccessible, unknown and inscrutable bureaucrats controlling the 
fate of all.  Can anyone describe the texture of life in Mrelu in this 
connection?

Another question wrt the Tsolyani calendar --- has anyone made one of these 
up, on paper or better yet in electronic form?  I'd love to have one to chart 
out the expedition Kagesh is about to be on --- and to make sure he doesn't 
miss any important Temple holidays!

Thanks,
Robert Goldman
Kagesh hi Tukkolen

Can you imagine the sheer amount of *effort* involved in sacrificing a Chlen?
Something about the concept is sending me into hysterics...  ;-)

[Moderator's Note:  Agreed!  The experience would probably kill a couple of ]
