[Moderator's Note:  Bob Dushay asks a question about Nobility, and its real ]
[                   meaning on Tekumel.                                     ]

Professor Barker: I was wondering about how nobility works in the social
hierarchy of Tsolyanu (and the other Five Empires).  Is nobility an obsolete
title that denotes breeding, like most of modern Europe, or is it a mark of
real status and power above being a member of a high clan/high lineage?
How does one become a noble?  How does one lose noble status?  Are the
perenially rebellious Vriddi and Ito clans noble?

Here's a brief [brief? ;)] answer to Bob Dushay's question:

In the Tekumel Sourcebook (Zocchi edition, p. 61), I wrote:

"The hereditary nobility of the Five Empires is descended from the 
aristocracy of the Bednalljan and Engsvanyali periods. A noble title now 
carries no necessary concomitant of political power or wealth, but there 
is still a correlation: the high clans which bear these appellations are 
the same clans which have remained close to the centres of authority the 
longest. Thus, while one may sometimes encounter a "High Lord" who has 
neither money nor an Imperial office, it is much more common to find such 
a person at the helm of affairs. As examples, one may cite the Tsolyani 
titles of /Arsekmekoi/ (the slashes denotes italicisation in the original) 
"Baron, a fiefholder of middle rank" (/-koi/ is a suffic added to most 
"noble" nouns; cf. the Tsolyani grammar), /Hehellukoi/ "Count," /Pachukoi/ 
"Lord," and /Mringukoi/ "High Lord." The first of these was once a 
Bendalljan military rank -- the commander of a city garrison; the second 
denoted a class of provincial courtiers in the Empire of Engsvan hla Ganga; 
the third was used for the kinsmen of the Bednalljan rulers; and the fourth 
signified the family members of the Engsvanyali Priestkings. These titles are 
only rarely conferred today, and they serve only as marks of Imperial favour. 
In the south they pass from eldest son to eldest son, while in the north they 
descend through the female line: a woman's husband holds the title only as 
long as she lives and/or the marriage lasts. Her sons are still "noble" but 
have no right to the title itself."

There is a link between clan and title of course. Middle and low clans 
almost never have members who hold these ancient titles, while the 
wealthiest and most prestigious clans (e.g. Sea Blue, Golden Bough, Golden 
Sunburst, Vriddi, Might of Ganga, Cloak of Azure Gems, etc.) include many 
title-holders, each tied by tradition, family, etc. to clan land holdings.

Getting a new title is VERY difficult, if not impossible. The current 
Emperor, Lord Dhich'une whose throne-name is "Eternal Splendour," has 
issued none at all -- perhaps because the worshippers of Lord Sarku were 
conspicuously ignored in both the Bednalljan and Engsvanyali peerages and 
were granted few such titles. As a result, the Sarku-worshipping clans 
tend to disdain such honours.

Most title-holders are males, but there are many women (particularly in 
the matrilineal north). There have even been one or two Pe Choi and a 
Pachi Lei in the distant past. None of the other nonhuman races has been 
so honoured.

I think I have had only one player character in all the years we have 
enjoyed Tekumel who actually achieved the title "Pachukoi." He had 
performed such services for the Empire that old Hirkane Tlakotani finally 
bestowed it on him. Others have applied but have been politely "put on 
hold" -- as I am sure most of us would be if we wrote in to the relevant 
British authorities today and asked for a peerage!

There is no egalitatarian in the Five Empires: when a title-holder attends
a large party or festival, his/her title is read out by the chamberlains 
whose task it is to admit and seat guests. It is also read with many 
honorifics and flowery praises when he/she is presented to the Governor 
or in the Hall of the Petal Throne. It is inscribed in gold ink on deeds, 
writs, and other documents, and mention of it will almost always get the 
person in to see priests, officials, and bureaucrats.

As stated above, land ownership is largely clan-based, so that only 
_personal_ lands may sometimes go with a title. A clan title, however, 
usually remains with a lineage and a family within that lineage, so that 
it is likely to be passed on to some scion of that family, rather than to 
some other person. Thus, as long as the Chaishyani lineage of the Golden 
Sunburst clan of Jakalla maintains its honour and position, the title of 
/Mringukoi/ that it has held since the days of the Priestkings will likely 
be handed on to the eldest son of the current owner.  It would only devolve 
upon some other person if the Chaishyanis had no children or were disgraced. 
Then the clan elders would meet and after much politicking, a new 
/Mringukoi/ would be selected. Money, clan loyalty, and service would play 
a large part in this, of course.

A noble _must_ hand on his/her title to the eldest son (in the south; cf. 
above), of course. One cannot just decide to give it away to a friend! If 
lands go with the title, then the fiefholder is responsible for taxes, 
arrears, and other expenses. Failure to pay these will bring about clan 
censure and quick action by the elders, who may pay amounts due but will 
then compel the fiefholder to surrender a share of the crops, produce, and 
business profits accruing from the land. Complete failure to pay -- or 
unwillingness -- will result in the clan getting a confiscation order from 
the Palace of the Realm, and the title will then be taken away from its 
holder and bestowed on some other clansman -- together with much social 
opprobrium and disgrace! I cannot remember the last time this rare step 
was taken.

THere are ceremonies, special costumes, honorific forms of address, and 
many other details that go along with a title, of course. The title-holder
is expected to be a little more ceremonious, aloof, and dignified. He/she 
is also expected to marry a person of similar glorified lineage as his/her 
"First Spouse," although concubines and lesser wives/husbands can be added 
without a problem.

Note that the "Baron" of Yan Kor is an /Arsekmekoi/ -- and very proud of 
it. He obtained this title years ago when he fought for the Tsolyani 
(before Kaidrach Field), and he retains it to this day. He could now grant 
himself all sorts of Yan Koryani titles and glorified epithets, but he 
does not. (Rather like "Colonel" Qadhafi of Libya, who, one assumes, could 
call himself pretty much what he pleased within his nation's boundaries.)

I hope this has been helpful.

Phil

[Moderator's Note:  I followed up with the Professor about this, and here is ]
[                   what he had to say.                                      ]

> Are the perenially rebellious Vriddi and Ito clans noble?

They both have MEMBERS who hold noble titles. THe Vriddi have more, the Itos 
considerably less. I don't know the exact number of "Lords," "Cou nts," etc. 
for either, however. I suspect it's about 10 ttitles for the Vriddi, some 
of which are clan-based, and 2 or 3 are "personal." The Itos probalby have 
only 1 or 2 clan-based titles and maybe 1 personal one (the current Ito 
overlord). 

>I would think the Vriddi are, since they have local control of Fasiltum (they
>do, don't they?).  I don't think the Itos have local control of their area,
>but then again, I could be wrong about that, too.

"Control" does not matter at all, any more than it does for modern British 
peers. Nobody "owns" or "controls" land. Titles are NOT based on "control" but 
on ancient tradition, rather like modern Europe.

Fiefs of land are ALL _Imperial_ in nature and can be given, changed, or 
taken away by the Emperor at any time. This applies both to "personal" 
lands and to clan-based lands. Temples also own land (under the Emperor), 
but corporations do not "own" land; their members do -- under the supreme 
right of the Emperor, of course. The Emperor normally does not rock the 
boat by depriving people of their hereditary clan lands or their personal 
lands. This would cause a lot of opposition that he doesn't need. He CAN 
confiscate ANYTHING, if he so desires and deems necesseary. Getting it 
away from its current owners is another story, of course, particularly 
in these troubled times. Legally, Dhich'une could even deprive his 
siblings of their Imperial titles and holdings and grant them his 
Sarku cronies. That would make his hold on the Petal Throne even more 
unstable than it currently is, and so he is very unlikely to try it.

Answer your question?

[Moderator's Note:  Bob Alberti offers up this tantalizing tidbit of info on  ]
[                   the possible effects of tinkering with  planar realities. ]

     Engaged in the neverending process of organizing my data (read 
"getting my Chlen-droppings together"), I came across this monograph 
by a scholar priest of Ksarul noted for his singular understanding of 
the Many Planes, an adherent to the "Great Tree" faction of 
interplanar scholars.

     Reviewing the monograph offers a glimpse into one school of 
Tsolyani scholarly thought regarding the nature of the Many Planes.

On the Employment of the Cup of Instant Extirpation
and How this Item is Best Used


The Cup of Instant Extirpation is a powerful magical 
device which can be employed to destroy an individual 
across a multitude of Planes of Reality simultaneously.  
However, elementary interplanar physics suggests that 
the employment of such a device can only generate 
useless side-planes, to the detriment rather than benefit 
of the wielder.  The author explains some means by which 
this cup can be employed safely and effectively.


The so-named "Cup of Instant Extirpation" has its origins in the 
unknown past.  Some claim it was and is sought for some time by 
the Undying Wizard whose name, T d, is foreign to the ear.  There 
is, of course, no way to confirm or deny these speculations.

In appearance the Cup is mundane, seeming to be a simple clay cup 
approximately three inches deep by two-and-a-half in diameter at 
its widest point, ovoid, and based on a conical clay stem about 
three inches high, two in diameter at the base, one-and-a-half 
where it joins the cup (Figure 1).  It bears what appears to be a 
black (sometimes deep blue) ceramic coating.  It appears only 
slightly magical to the trained eye.  Do not be deceived, however, 
for this is a mighty magical item!
              ____
            < ____ >
            \_ __ _/
              |  |
             |_  _|
               
Figure 1.  The Cup of Instant Extirpation.

Until recently the cup was lost among the belongings of a Priest of 
Ksarul in Mrelu, who was employing it as a mundane toothbrush-
holder!  The advances of the forces of Prince Eselne hiTlakotane into 
that region forced his evacuation to Hmakuyal, where the item was 
recovered by the author.

When properly employed, the Cup acts to destroy a given target 
individual, slaying them instantly not only on the plane of 
employ, but on all nearby side-planes for several (an untranslatable 
unit of measure).  While potent in its effect, it is rendered almost 
useless when examined from the point-of-view of multiplanar causality.

Multiplanar causality demands that the most likely things occur in the 
most likely fashion.  For instance, if I release a stone, it should 
fall a predictable path and land on the ground before me.  If it 
does so, it exists on a plane which can be called "normal", and 
which runs a normal path through the multiverse of possible planes 
(Figure 2, a).  If the stone behaves in an "unlikely" manner, say 
it is affected by a Translocation spell to fly upwards or sideways,
then it exists on a slightly-less-normal plane, one which moves 
down a path divergent from what is "normal" (b).  If the stone 
behaves in extremely unlikely manner -- turns into a flock of 
Kuni-birds, for instance, which fly away  -- then it can be 
presumed to exist on plane which runs an extremely unusual path 
through the multiverse (c).

 (a)   Normal =======================>  stone at rest
              | (b) \========>  stone's path diverted by magic
              \
           (c)  \___.  stone spontaneously becomes Kuni birds

Figure 2.  Elementary Planar Physics.

It is well-understood, therefore, that there are many cases in 
which an action is so unlikely or its effects are so profound that 
they can generate "impossible" planes -- planes which are 
physically or logically inconsistent.  These planes can suffer several 
fates.  They can loop endlessly in time; they can fade into 
insubstantiality; and they can "break" from their original plane 
and become a "pocket" or "side" plane (ref. the work of the noted 
scholar Kalusu hiViridame "On Small or Unlikely Planes and their 
Qualities and Fogulations", available in the Library of Azure 
Knowing in Bey Su).

We return from our excursion into planar physics to the 
circumstance of the Cup of Instant Extirpation.  It should now be 
obvious to the reader why such an item is dangerous; its use would 
possibly place one's own plane, and many others, into a highly 
unlikely state.  When it is considered that it would most likely be 
used as a weapon of political assassination when wielded by those 
unversed in the knowledge of our Blue Lord, its possible 
ramifications become daunting indeed.  To employ this cup against 
a figure of some influence, say against a high priest or major 
head-of-state, would possibly send one's plane off to join the 
dusty texts of Priestess Kalusu upon some scholar's shelf!

However, it IS possible to employ this cup, both safely and 
effectively, and this I desire to demonstrate with this document.

Consider first that some bumbling peasant or Thumis priest wields 
the Cup, inadvertently or not, against some foe.  Instantly, and 
across many planes, that individual's Skein of Destiny is ripped 
from its loom and woven as sail-fabric into the barques which 
carry the Gloriously Departed to the Isles of Teretane.  The 
spontaneous and apparently causeless death of this individual would 
cause many planes to diverge sharply from normal circumstance.

If this person is of no import to events on the plane -- if, for an 
extreme example, he or she were about to perish of natural means 
-- then the plane might soon rejoin the "normal path" towards the 
future.  However, if this person were to have spawned several 
children, and if one of those would have, say, overthrown the 
Salarvyani in war and secured the Influence of Tsolyanu across the 
eastern portion of the continent, then it is possible that the side-
path might never rejoin that which is fated to see the God Emperor 
control all the world.  And if this person was mighty in stature, and 
due to influence all of Tekumel, the plane might proceed off into the 
realm of the Unlikely and Impossible, losing physical cohesion as it 
loses logical possibility, finally evaporating into Nothing.

All this time, the original wielder of the Cup is trapped on a side-
plane of his or her own making.  The Cup and wielder remain with 
the plane as the prime cause of these unlikely and unfortunate 
events.  A logical and just end for those who would thwart the will of 
the very Gods!

Consider now, another circumstance.  The Cup is borne by a 
competent user, a Priest of Ksarul versed in the Arts, to some 
distant and unoccupied side-plane.  To this place the target is 
lured forth.  Consider:  now the target has, by his or her own will, 
divorced themselves voluntarily from the Planes of Reality which 
we call "normal".  These planes proceed forth, unaffected by the 
fate which befalls the target.  The Cup may then be employed 
effectively, and the wielder can return by magical means to the 
Primary Planes, which remain unaffected by the not-at-all 
unusual circumstance of the victim's failure to return from the 
Planes Beyond!

And consider finally this median circumstance.  The Priest of 
Ksarul, by grace of our All-Knowing Lord, proceeds as described to 
an unoccupied and distant side-plane.  There he wields the cup 
against a target who remains on the Primary Planes.  What are the 
effects?

The apparently causeless effect of the spontaneous extirpation of an 
individual from a Primary Plane would undoubtedly be the 
creation of a multitude of dire side-planes.  However, the wielder 
would not be on any of those planes.  By definition, those planes 
which split off towards some unpleasant end would no longer be 
Primary Planes.  The Priest then returns by magical means.  He 
will find himself back on his original Primary Plane, sometime 
after he left, with his target apparently unaffected and whole.

Possibly the target could now be tricked into fleeing to the resultant 
side-planes, where his presence would be unchallenged by his 
original on that plane, but where his eventual doom would be 
sealed as the side-plane met its end.  Regardless, this example 
serves to illustrate that the Cup of Instant Extirpation is not an 
entirely suicidal and useless device, but an item which can be 
turned effectively to one's ends if wielded carefully and with due 
consideration.

Of course, these suppositions and theories must remain only that;
theory.  The effects of the Cup of Instant Extirpation upon the 
Planes of Reality are non-trivial, and should never be explored.  To 
do so is to risk the lives of uncounted millions!  Be warned!  Even 
the attention of the Gods themselves might be turned towards those 
so foolish as to attempt to employ the dire Cup!

[Moderator's Note:  Alan Brain from down under seeks some assistance in un-  ]
[                   tangling a difficult mess.                               ]

A character ( rather than a player ) asked me a difficult question some time
ago - and I have no answer. Suggestions please:

Background:
This 15 year old girl is the Niece of a fairly well-connected ( or
ill-connected ?) Sorceror, and former Protector Pro Tempore of (an area
near?) the Charigarri Protectorate. ( For a very short period of time, in
between 'real' Protectors, who come from much higher lineage. In fact,
starting just before a Ssu Incursion, and finishing as soon as the peril had
been dealt with). Her family is an offshoot of the otherwise undistinguished
Sable Bough Clan, of middle status - her Uncle having brought the Clan great
honour by his extremely temporary elevation.
Her Uncle has dissappeared ( not unusual ), but this time without leaving
his affairs in order. Her Father is fighting somewhere in the west, her
Mother is continuously "unwell", and the Clan Elders are gently reminding
her that they are there to help.
Her problem is that she has been left with the Family Secrets. She has been
left aghast at what she's learnt. Her family is not of the lineage she
thought - a 'poor but not ignoble' one, but instead of an ancient lineage
indeed, yet ignoble. One tracing back to Kheiris. In fact, they claim to be
the only family NOT connected in any way whatsoever with Pendarte, and still
able to claim the name (translated from the Mu'ugalavyani) hiKheiris. And
not connected in any way with the Sable Bough clan either, except by
adoption and deceit.
I say translated from the Mu'ugalavyani. In fact, her esteemed, heroic and
Noble Uncle, honoured for his Imperial Service many times over, is in fact a
Mu'ugalavyani, one of the detested Red Hats. He merely awaits the day when
he will be 'activated', a day which may never come.
Many things now begin to make sense. Why was the family relocated en masse
from the borders of Do Chaka clean across the Empire? Her Uncle was
'honoured' all right. Honoured with a suicide mission that he managed to
accomplish with a whole skin. The 'gifts' he had given to the Military
Party, and to the Imperium may have saved the Family - or may not.
Regardless, neither the Ndalu clan nor (as her Uncle put it) "the
dunderheaded half-baked RBC" were pleased by her Uncle's actions. And her
Uncle's friends from the Blue Curtain are incommunicado or dead now. It also
seems most unlikely that any service he could do for the Four Palaces could
make up for the power contained in even one of the 'gifts'.
But these are all minor matters. Her real problem is that she has been cast
adrift from all she knew and held sacred. What she wants to know is: What is
the 'honourable thing' to do? Bare all, and have her Father, Mother and
Infant Brother disgraced, reviled and Impaled, her adopted Clan forever
shamed? Or to carry on the Family Business, hoping she never gets the
Message 'Mne'ivi'ish - The Four Sleepers Awake'?
One thing she doesn't have to worry about: the Family Secrets known not even
to the Red Hats include certain mental exercises, techniques and disciplines
that preclude mental eavesdropping - probably one of the main reasons why
her family was chosen for the mission. Such techniques - very similar in
some ways to the standard Body Control abilities taught at certain temples -
do have some side-effects though. They CAN lead to Mental instability in the
weak ( as in her Mother...), difficulties in verbal communication (her
brother still cannot speak properly), and other effects ( an increased
aptitude for manipulation of other planar energy involving Mind Control ).

(Description of the latest conversation)
According to her, Communication with some Ssu IS possible. After a fashion.
She said "Examine the shape of a Lintel.. by changing the shape of it, you
change the path a Dri will choose upon it, nga? You communicate with it, and
it with you by its actions. Of course (she giggles) Ssu are MUCH harder!".
She then looked somewhat sad, and dreamily murmured "The Shamtla they seek
runs in our veins..." then recovered with a start.

[Moderator's Note:  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH!  ]
[                   :)  Not again!                                            ]

"Here is the dagger my Uncle left. You know the story?" ( I did, but didn't
interrupt ) "A most Mighty, Powerful and Puissant Ssu, there was, Yea,
Black, Sorcerous, and Terrible. From the uttermost East she(?) came, riding
the tempest, high above the lands, Havoc her breath, Devastation her words,
Death her Lover and her Friend. Yea, the weeping and the lamentation rose to
the Sky, but not in her path - for there reigned only tenebrous silence."
This was NOT the style, nor the wording, I was familiar with. The facts I
knew: that a Black Ssu, a powerful Magician (as much as one can use that
word applied to something so Alien), riding an Aircar of some sort, had
carved a swathe of complete desolation, casually immolating soldiers and
their sorcerous contingents without slowing. Somehow ("The Lintel" she
whispered then - which gave me pause) her Uncle, a sorceror of hitherto
unrevealed power, had met this entity in single combat - and after a magical
duel of epic proportions ( though no-one who witnessed all of it survived -
which is why there has been no epic - or perhaps the epic has been
suppressed...) had fought it to a standstill. Neither Man nor Ssu could
penetrate the other's defence, though automata crashed and parried, Walls
rose and fell. Until this Sorcerer, his every resource expended,
exasperatedly threw the dagger his niece was now holding in the general
direction of his opponent - directly into one milk-white eye. Thus the
story. The blasted craters, the wreckage, the area where even now things
grow strange and un-natural - if at all - attest to its veracity.
"Silly, she WANTED to die! Wasn't that obvious? Oh, my apologies, Exalted
Sir (she used the form -tlakome`lu rather than dlaka`n- , but I let it
pass), forgive this poor vessel for her most intemperate outburst. I shame
my Parents, My Clan" ( at this a few tears started to fall, as she whispered
under her breath) "whatever it is.." then continued "...and Myself. I beg
your leave to meditate on my penitence" ( Thus in accordance to the
prescribed forms for a well-brought up child apologising to one of equal
status in that part of Tsolyanu near Charigari).

The dagger appears to be just the sort of thing a Magician of some power
would carry. Fabulous Iron - but not of particularly good quality. Enchanted
- but no more so , indeed, less so, than one could expect of such a
Magician. Yet she took this, the Family Treasure, with her, and held it
close as she retired into the Great Library, once more to peruse the
Congnoscent Splendour of Pulchritudinous Sapience, or perhaps the

Again - suggestions please, on how to help this young person? For she has
already started the wheels in motion to declare herself Aridani - a
neccessary step before SHE makes the decision.

[Moderator's Note:  The Professor responds to Evan's message about Subadim   ]
[                   and Hrugga.  He has sent me some info, and has pointed me]
[                   in the direction of Subadim, so I will check into that   ]
[                   and follow up with that info in the next day or so.      ]

Subadim is mentioned on p. 11 of the Sourcebook (Zocchi version). There 
isn't much there. Subadim is the protagonist of many legends, mostly later 
Ensvanyali or early Classical Tsolyani, but he is also rumoured to have 
lived long before these under other names. His visit to the Home of the 
Gods, and his search for the Egg of the World on Thenu Thendraya Peak are 
stories known to every schoolchild. He is said to have possessed a magic 
cup (perhaps the one described by Arjai hiVaisoner in a Blue Room dispatch 
I have just enjoyed, and also a magic ship that moved without oars or sails 
and was made of scintillating white metal. He also wrote a book about the 
Farther Planes beyond the Pylons; it was titled "Realms Beyond the Triple 
Knot," and it is now lost. The last copy is said to have been destroyed 
when the armies of Emperor Trakonel I burned the temples of the One Other 
in Tsolyanu.

The epic of Hrugga is clearly a legend built up around a real warrior. His 
exploits run on to several volumes, and there are at least two recensions 
of these, giving different dates, places, and adventures. He is thus a 
little like Hercules. The stories are in Engsvanyali verse in the longest 
recension ( -- and don't ask me to write it all out or quote extensively!) 
and are episodic in nature. Hrugga was apparently one of the Heroes of 
the Age, groups that the Gods choose to defend the structure and stability 
of Tekumel's Plane. These small groups are picked at crisis points along 
the main timeline, whenever there are threats (usually from the Pariah 
Gods) to the Skein of Reality. They are given specific taks and objectives. 
If they win against the foes the enemies cast up against them, then all 
is well and the universe goes on. If they fail, then there is catastrophe 
and doom and darkness across the lands. It is said that the failure of 
the Engsvanyali hero Kokun led tot he sinking of Ganga and the rise of 
the northern seas to become the central interior plain of Yan Kor.

Hrugga is said to have gambled with Avanthe,"won the world, two moons, 
and half as much again," but nobly continued playing until he lost it 
all back so as not to embarrass her. (This is from a Bednalljan court 
poet from the time of Nayari -- so he is at least that ancient.) He is 
also reported crushing the demon Qu'u on Thenu Thendraya Peak, zapped 
the Demon of Death (Missum) on Dormoron Plain in defence of the heroes 
of Stability, and fought the giant Nirusama in a terrible battle that 
is said in the legend to have lasted "three ages and an aeon."

I have not put these epics together in written form. You'll have to 
piece them together from whatever your Tsolyani friends tell you as 
you experience Tekumel.  I must note that I do NOT allow these characters 
to become central in my games - - it tends to put too much pressure on 
the players to have to deal with worldshaking events far beyond their 
ken -- and they can then savour the occasional chance to meet and gain 
aid or advice from such mighty figures of legend.

Do you refer to the Shadow Gods of Livyanu -- or possibly to the three 
Pariah Deities, who now exist only in secret cliques and enclaves here 
and there across the Five Empires? The Shadow Gods are briefly described 
on pp. 53-54 of the Zocchi Sourcebook. The Pariah Gods are mentioned on 
p. 55. (Somebody can tell us what the TOME version page numbers are, if 
they are needed.) One of these days I'll get around to writing more 
about these various pantheons; I know what they are and what they are 
attempting to do, but they are not central to my own interests on Tekumel, 
and so they have never been completely codified. 

I hope this helps a bit. As I say, this is not one of my own major areas 
of interest, and legend, in my opinion, ought to remain legend...

[Moderator's Note:  The professor adds his opinion on the difficult situation ]
[                   Alan described, and adds some very tasty news of the em-  ]
[                   pire.  WOW!                                               ]

This is the sort of difficult question that I am most reluctant to address. 
It is clear that the girl has a duty to the Imperium (patriotism, as we 
might put it these days), but her loyalty to her clan, lineage, and parents 
is likely to be greater and more compelling. (What, for example, would YOU 
do if you found your father was a spy for a hostile power?)

At the moment, she is far from the Mu'ugalavyani border and from any 
pressing reason to run in to the Palace of the Realm and "fess up." 
The Empire is in flux these days anyway, and it will likely not matter 
what she says or does at this point. Prince Rereshqala's armies have 
just marched unopposed into Thraya, and the next step is Sokatis. The 
Governor of Sokatis is a worshipper of Durritlamish, but he despises 
Dhich'une and will likely collaorate with either Eselne or Rereshqala, 
whoever gets to him with enough troops first. The Sarku legions have 
been routed in the southeast, and there is rumour of a mighty battle 
to the east of Avanthar, with Prince Mirusiya's Vimuhla troops from 
Fasiltum receiving direct aid from the Baron of Yan Kor and the Lady 
Deq Dimani.  Her Legion of the Fishers of the Flame contains crack 
troops with a lot of battle experience. I think Dhich'une's in trouble...

There is even a story to the effect that the Worm Emperor has fled 
westwards to Aukesha and farther to the City of Sarku. No one can 
confirm this. Prince Taksuru, the most recently revealed heir to 
the Petal Throne, is also said to have driven Dhich'une's forces 
back north to the very gates of Avanthar, where he hopes to meet 
with Mirusiya and the Baron and decide on strategies against both 
Eselne and Rereshqala. All is chaos...

To the specific question of the girl:

Her father has survived the battle for Bey Su, fighting for Prince 
Taksuru. He is now on furlough and has written to his wife to ask 
about his daughter. Her mother's illness might be helped if her 
handsome, heroic husband were to get a leave and come home.

Her uncle is probably fled to Mu'ugalavya, where the Red Hats have 
put him into a unit charged with administering the conquered lands 
of Pan Chaka. They may pull him out at any time and send him back 
into Tsolyanu to try to cause disruption between the Princes and 
shape things more to their liking. At the moment, her uncle is not 
a problem to her. Nothing she does can really stop him or even hinder 
his plans. The Empire is too fragmented for messages to travel all the 
way across to the Chakas, and there are more important considerations 
(including mobs of refugees pouriing into Sokatis and Thraya from the 
battles farther west.

I doubt whether the Mu'ugalavyani will ever bother to "activate" her 
or her family. They are just a little preoccupied in Pan Chaka nd down 
in Livyanu.

Her mind-control abilities can be easily overcome by more powerful 
sorcerers, of course. Less experienced sorcerers will find her impossible 
to "read," and if she ever REALLY comes to the attention of the Imperium, 
they'll simply pass her on to somebody who'll riffle her mental pages 
like a telephone book!

I hope she never actually HAS to try to converse with a Ssu. My current 
group is all too familiar with the monsters! Good luck. (In my campaign 
she'd be unable to get a message across on any regular basis unless she 
rolled a percentile dice score of 1-10 each time.) The Ssu would almost 
certainly have her for breakfast.  The Black Ssu are the most dangerous 
of all. They are anything but "insensate beasts," possessing all the 
intelligence, courage, and talents of their human enemies and then some! 
If they bred faster, there would be no stopping them -- unless the great 
Hokun empires of the southern seas could defeat them.

Her story is interesting. One wonders how she survived in the midst of 
such a battle?

I would suggest for now that the girl remain silent. See her father, if 
possible, and leave the Mu'ugalavyani problem strictly alone. Only if 
there is some reason for her to travel to the Chakas -- or for her uncle 
to reappear -- does she need to think about telling the Omnipotent Azure 
Legion of her family's ugly little history.

Hopes this helps, Phil

[Moderator's Note:  The Professor adds to Chuck's answer.                   ]

Chuck has hit the legendary nail on its proverbial head. I think the idea 
was to keep the girl alive and get her OUT of trouble -- not just "off" 
her. Bad! Naughty! But tempting in such complex circumstances.

Or maybe let the Mu'ugalavyani know she's thinking of finking, and let 
THEM take care of her... The Mourners in Sable are at least as nasty as 
the Omnipotent Azure Legion -- not quite up to the standards of the 
Livyani Vru'uneb, but getting close. 

We've all been reading too many John LeCarre novels, I suspect.

[Moderator's Note:  Another good reply, this from Tekunu.  I have to agree  ]
[                   with him about his solution.                            ]

   I am Tekunu hi'Qolyelmu, perhaps you have heard of me in the third
solitaire adventure book. 
    Well hmmmmmm......I was faced with a similar situation, related but
outside the adventure as addressed in the solitaire adventure book. I found
out that my family secret proves that I am indeed the great-uncle to the
current emperor and most of his siblings of whom I am aware.  In effect, for
the good of the empire, (tis' better to say that than to admit being a
coward) my father had given up the gold and we were secreted away to become a
member of the Golden Sunburst clan in order to stabilize the area around
Jakalla for the imperial family and to watch and sit upon the important
access to various machines, tubeway stations and other secrets located just
under the surface on my fief.  More or less strengthen ties you see.  The
Watchers at the Threshold.  And other obscure titles.
    Much to my consternation I found myself involved with politics....nasty,
vulgar and totally useless pastime that interferes with my study of the Four
F's: Flora, Fauna, Feasting (Jakalla Cuisine only please), and Fornication (I
believe I owe the Temple of Dlamelish about a million kaitars, or is it two).
 
  So what does one do when faced with such things that threaten to ruin your
very existance, your reason to live!!  
      Travel !!!  Stride forth mightily,  by the Gods with approval and
backing of some truly noble one like myself.  Thats what she needs to do.
 She is more than welcome to come along with me to the Southern Continent to
help obtain exotic and rare plant clippings.  Or to sail along the Salarvyani
coast with Cap'n Pior to hunt for the Great White Akho :  Moab hi'Dikh!    

    If she wishes she must make it to the docks at Jakalla by the 17th of
next month.  We already have about twenty or thirty agents and spies aboard
the ship, but I don't believe we have an agent for the Mu'uglavya yet. (Maybe
we already have two.  I forget.)  Anyway, we could always use another Red Hat
spy to balance the party.  She could convince that she has been invited along
on a secret mission for the prince,  must go, opportunity of a life time and
all that.  She can spy and report her findings on the Southern Continent or
the Salarvya.   I'll even make sure she "discovers" some secrets along the
way, to give her a chance for glory.  I have the adventures somewhat mapped
out, to ease the refereeing.  I can provide you with what notes I have as
time goes on.

Let me know.

Tekunu hi'Qolyelmu

[Moderator's Note:  Evan asks some questions about the current environs around]
[                   Jakalla, given the state of the empire.  More good info   ]
[                   here!                                                     ]

Frankly, I don't know the answers to some of Evan's questions myself. 
Prince Rereshqala left the city in charge of some city guard officer 
or other, and I don't have the man's name. Dhich'une's troops did try 
to retake the city -- briefly and abortively -- by an invasion across 
the river from the swamps to the west. They had complete surprise but 
were too few to win past the walls of the Foreigners' Quarter into the 
main city. Rereshqala's household guards (from his palace SE of Jakalla) 
worked with the city guards, some temple troops, and elements of various 
legions stationed there to defeat them handily.
 
>I was curious if any body could help me with the following questions? 
>1.) Which Legions are still stationed in Jakalla? Who is in command of
>them i.e. the name of the commanders.?

At the moment, only Tlaneno the Steersman is known to be in Jakalla. 
Some other high officials are with Rereshqala near Thraya, heading 
north towards Sokatis. Several are blocking Eselne's push southward on 
the Sakbe Road just north of Usenanu. Eselne himself is in Hauma, trying 
to negotiate with Taksuru, who is in turn in league with Mirusiya (and 
the Yan Koryani under Baron Ald and Deq Dimani), who are now advancing 
on Avanthar.

>2.) After the Sarku forces were repulsed what happened? Did the people
>burn down the temple of Sarku? What about the city itself? Was it badly
>damaged during the invasion? Did the people riot after the forces of Sarku
>were defeated or were they too terrified and shocked?

The city was not badly damaged -- the yearly summer food riots are often 
worse than this was! The temple of Sarku was sealed y order of Prince 
Rereshqala, and his troops prevented it from being burned down totally. 
Some parts were damaged, however. 

>3.) What did the other temples do during the invasion attempt? I would
>especially like to know what the followers of Ksarul did and are currently
>doing. All of my party happened to choose Ksarul as their diety and I would
>like to know what the temple of Ksarul feels about the current state of
>affairs in Jakalla and the Empire.

The temple of Ksarul wanted to join with Taksuru (who is a worshipper of 
the Doomed Prince), but Rereshqala's presence kept them from doing so. 
They thus stayed quiet, went about "business as usual," and avoided the 
conflict, while offering food and other non-military aid to the people 
of the city. They thus won some points for being good samaritans! 
Rereshqala keeps an eagle eye on them, since his campaign cannot succeed 
if he is stabbed in the back by disaffected temple politicians! He has 
assured the Ksarul people that he will work with Taksuru to ensure a good 
share of the goodies of a reunified Empire for them. The temple lacks 
troops and support in Jakalla proper to do very much about this, although 
they do have more followers across in Pala Jakalla (not in Musa Jakalla, 
though). The general opinion in the tmeple is that at least Rereshqala 
will give them a fair deal, whereas Eselne will not want to work with them 
or with Taksuru, and Mirusiya would almost certainly be a disaster for 
Ksarul's interests! He actually gets along better with the followers of 
Karakan than he does with the two "knowledge" temples.

>4.) What is the current situation in Jakalla? What is the mood of the
>people? Is everything under control or does lawlessness rule the streets?

The city guards have most of the city under control by now. Rereshqala 
left a unit or two of his household guards in Jakalla, and some small 
contingents of other Jakalla legions are also helping out. The fighting 
did deter the usual summer heat/food rioting somewhat, and the temple of 
Avanthe joined with the temple of Hnalla (both Rereshqala supporters) to 
arrange for grain, fresh water, fruit from the villages, and other needed 
supplies. The city declared a special holiday of thanksgiving for 
Rereshqala, which was celerated on the summer solstice (3rd of Langala) 
with much free food, liquor, and general rejoicing. Sarku's people were 
the only ones who did not attend.

>5.) What is the current date/timeline in the proffesors game? The
>most recent info regarding the state of affairs in Tsolyanu I could find was
>from Nov 1994. Any help would be appreciated.  

Our current group is off in the hinterlands northeast of Sokatis, and I 
haven't had a chance to look at a calendar lately. I know it is Fesru 
(23? 25?) in the year 2,367 -- I think! I can't be certain without some 
calculation. Ask Bob Alberti, who is a better record keeper than I.

I hope this answers some of your questions. I can't go into them in more 
detail because I haven't been back to Jakalla myself (in our game) for 
months, and I tend to lose track. All my party is getting out in the wilds 
of eastrn Tsolyanu is rumour and stories from the refugees who keep coming 
into Sokatis from farther west. They report that there have been a number 
of battles against the Sarku legions north and east of Jakalla, which 
Rereshqala's forces won. No one in our group has actually seen the military 
dispatches, however.

Best I can do from here.

Dear Professor Barker,

     I am a 23-year-old worshipper of Karakan of the Sword of Fire 
Clan, working in as the assistant to the majordomo of a small fief.  
The fiefholder is a beautiful woman of my clan, about my age, who 
worships Vimuhla.  I am smitten with her, and she seems to like me too.

     How do I approach her under these circumstances?  On the one
hand she is a clan-cousin, and our temples get along passably well as 
long as Imperial Prince Eselne is not directly contesting with 
Imperial Prince Mirusiya.  We are not particularly partisan nor 
terribly pious, so we don't feel this would cause many problems.
On the other hand, she is the ruler of the fief, and my boss's boss.
He is a hardened veteran who could as easily slice me into lunchmeat
as look at me, and I don't want to tick him off by having 
undo influence with his boss.

     Additionally, how do I court her in a manner which befits our 
status while isolated in this tiny rural fief?  Assuming I could 
obtain proper gifts and dress, what clan-rituals, customs, and taboos 
will I face?

     Finally, assuming I'm successful and I sack this babe ^H^H^H^H^H 
^H^H^H^H^H^H win this lady's affections, how long do I have before 
she, and everyone else, start expecting me to marry her?  If she 
twists my arm into marrying her, how is the wedding arranged, 
considering that my home is halfway across the empire, and her family 
is in a city which is a few days away?  How elaborate is it?  How long 
does one plan such a wedding?  How do the different temples handle 
marriages, or isn't marriage considered a particularly relgious 
institution?

     Please respond soon.  I've been reading your column ever since I 
was in temple school, and I always follow your advice.

Signed

Quandry in Kashkomai

[Moderator's Note:  Tekunu provides us with some more info about Prince      ]
[                   Reresqala and the goings on around Jakalla.              ]

Oh Truly Great One (Phil).  I will add what notes I took about the attempted
storming of Rareshqala's Palace by the Salarvyani. Hmmm....well here it
goes.....

>From the Journal of Lord Tekunu hi' Qolyelmu:
Ed notes: Usual spelling errors, please excuse Great One.
[Moderator's Note:  I tidied up some of them Alan.                           ]

Summoned by the Lady Devai to her presence on the 16th of Langala, 2366.  
The guards took us down to her. She is lolling upon a divan surrounded 
by many pets and animals. Others are about her having a good time playing 
empress.  She asks after the comfort of the party during the previous 
evening.  We are fed and asked if we will leave this day. We say yes as 
we are duty bound.  Devai is drinking a clear pale liquid that has a heady 
perfumy smell. Is very powerful and good, and has a perfumy after taste. 
A couple of the girls discuss as to what they are going to do. Then 
Meeyab came in and said the next time you do this to one of my people I 
will float you out in the harbour.  It seems that the previous night one 
of her greater friends had died.  When Rereshqala comes back to the palace 
she will tell on Devai. Devai kicked her out of the palace and she left 
the palace with just her clothes on her back.  She was condemned to death 
if she returns.

Devai then asks us to stay another day.  Bechagga Dzuvayya, a concubine 
of the prince, wishes to go back to Shiggath on the flats.  Kagor the 
cook (cooks the best Jakallan cuisine outside of Jakalla in the Five 
Empires), wants to come along and needs to get the best food. 

Pi'ur hi' Garuma is the captain of the ship. The first officer is a 
Vimuhla worshipper, Hrinuo.  He is a good ship's officer. It costs about 
1000 to make the writ good as to get the ships stores correct. We have 12 
Marines and 25 sailors aboard the ship and we are preparing to go forward 
on the adventure.  Bechagga wishes to go. She lets us know that the 
Salarvyani have almost conquered the forest. The shipping has expanded 
and the Tsolyani have almost moved out of the southeast ocean. They have 
lost much face.  There is someone who killed another person because he 
spoke Tsolyani with an accent.

The parties start in the afternoon and continues into the evening.  The 
lady is fickle and her assistants may be quick to die.  Kama'ay, the 
Naqsi woman, also wishes to go home. She wants to come with us.  She knew 
the brother of a party member and she could speak the languages of the 
south.  Bria will also come with us. She is a musician of incredible 
ability and can sing with an excellent journey. She was Sonkolel's friend. 

The tides are at 4:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.  Fireworks display for the
entertainment of the assembled whorde. Dancers and perverts.  The 
banquet is splendid. A Salarvyani officer has come forth and talked to 
Devai.  The Salarvyani troops have marched up the coast and demand that 
the palace surrender.  The palace has 400 troops and who knows the size 
of the Salarvyani force.  There are too many dandies in the force. The 
party continues forward as with having fun.  We cannot get into the armory 
but they will allow us to use the lightning bringer if we can fly to the 
roof. Riestu hi Vraicha is the noble who kills instantly without mercy 
anyone who insults Tsolyanu.  What a man!!  I speak with him, praising 
his nobility, we rattle our swords and he prepares a sortie. (He is bold 
and brash to the point of being foolish, I egg him on calculating that 
it is better him  then me leading a sortie outside the walls with a Hairy 
Hoard of Salarvyani looking for blood)  At about midnight, we go to Devai.  
The difficulty is that there are many guards here and there are not many 
that have actual combat experience. The point further is that those that 
know what is going on are of lower ability.  Oh well, what can be done.  
We form our party into a group, ready to fight our way out if necessary.   
We call again at the armory and we find further that there is a magical 
shield around the top of the facility.  No one must be able to get in or 
out.  We get crossbows from the firing range and training area.  There is  
a disturbance at the northern end of the palace. 

Sarku Troops  and 20 to 30 dandies are charged with defending the road
engage in a fight with the Salarvyani.  Then Riestu hi Vraicha makes his
sortie with about 15 to 20 dandies. The party remains behind to hold the 
gate and fight the Salarvyani most of the eveningjust outside the gate.  
We send out several hundred non combatants to get them away from the 
action.  The gate is damaged. The next morning there are about 30 of 
the men coming back.  Several hundred Salarvyani are routed  and a 
hundred killed in the battle.  Riestu hi Vraicha is an incredible 
individual.  He single handedly killed every Salarvyani officer we ran 
into.  (If he wasn't so sticky and full of himself and an ass, although 
a noble one, I would ask him along)  We strike a noble pose defending 
the gate at dawn for everyone in the palace to see.

Documents are sent to the prince that all is well.  There is a Tsolyani
force we hear of far to the east. A Hlaka has seen them but then did not
approach.

The boats were saved.  We go to the longboat and prepare to go away.  We
sail on the 17th of Langala.

I will attempt to find my notes concerning riots and fighting in the city.

All is well.

P.S.  If anyone is near Jakalla and is interested in reading my book Flora
and Fauna of the Southern Continent (illustrations by Lord Trinesh hi

[Moderator's Note:  Professor Barker responds to Bob's Love woes...   ;)     ]

I will try to answer some of the societal questions raised by Bob 
Alberti's letter, but I am not able to deal with love affairs, dating, 
sexual dalliances, and related personal problems! 

>     I am a 23-year-old worshipper of Karakan of the Sword of Fire 
>Clan, working in as the assistant to the majordomo of a small fief.  
>The fiefholder is a beautiful woman of my clan, about my age, who 
>worships Vimuhla.  I am smitten with her, and she seems to like me too.

You'll have to see how your clan and her clan like the idea. Unlike 
our own "individualist" society, Tekumel is strongly based on societal 
ties. Nobody exists in a cultural vacuum on Tekumel. A quick roll in 
the hay is fine on Tekumel, and marriages between totally opposed 
religions and clans are not unknown. If you want approval, however, 
you should seek connections that both clans approve.

>     How do I approach her under these circumstances?  On the one
>hand she is a clan-cousin, and our temples get along passably well as 
>long as Imperial Prince Eselne is not directly contesting with 
>Imperial Prince Mirusiya.

The relationship between a Karakan worshipper and a follower of Vimuhla 
is more easily possible than some others, provided neither party is 
fanatic about religion. The temples of the two "war" gods are actually 
fairly friendly these days, although their prime protagonists, Princes 
Eselne and Mirusiya, are likely to come to blows sooner or later.

>He is a hardened veteran who could as easily slice me into lunchmeat
>as look at me, and I don't want to tick him off by having

You'll have to see how your boss feels about it all. He is really 
irrelevant, of course, unless he also wants the woman. If he does not, 
and as long as you don't cross him in your official, business capacity, 
he shouldn't have much objection.
 
>     Additionally, how do I court her in a manner which befits our 
>status while isolated in this tiny rural fief?  Assuming I could

A roll in the hay comes to mind: Hmelu do it, Chlen do it, peasants 
manage -- why not you two? You cannot expect to obtain all the fancy 
gifts and other things that might be available in a bigger city. If 
you want clan approval, you'll both have to return home and present 
yourselves to your clans, parents, and relatives. They'll organise 
feasts, parties, etc. and arrange for whatever wedding festivities 
you two might desire -- if it comes to that. Quick affairs are a lot 
easier and do not carry much social opprobrium.
 
>     Finally, assuming I'm successful and I sack this babe ^H^H^H^H^H 
>^H^H^H^H^H^H win this lady's affections, how long do I have before 
>she, and everyone else, start expecting me to marry her? 

That's up to you two. Nobody will "expect" you to marry her, but she 
may herself feel that way. As I say, quick affairs are easy and frequent, 
and you two can just "try it on for size" without worry, as long as you 
have a large supply of Lisutl-root.

>If she 
>twists my arm into marrying her, how is the wedding arranged, 
>considering that my home is halfway across the empire, and her family 
>is in a city which is a few days away?  How elaborate is it?  How long 
>does one plan such a wedding?  How do the different temples handle 
>marriages, or isn't marriage considered a particularly relgious 
>institution?

All of these questions depend upon the couple, the clans, and the 
temples involved. One assumes your clan is represented in her city, 
so that your clansmen can stand in for your parents and relatives. 
Weddings depend upon wealth and clan traditions. Weddings are not 
particularly "religious," although priests may be invited to offer 
prayers and eulogies. See the (Zocchi) Sourcebook, pp. 42 and 48. 
If neither of you have prior commitments, and if both are free and 
independent (Aridani for her), then you can organise the wedding much 
as you wish.

Hmmm er well....couldn't find the journal entry about the riots in early
Langala in Jakalla but I will recall what I can remember.

Background:  The Golden Sunburst Clan House is located in the Southeast
Quadrant of the City, our warehouses are located nearer the river.  I came to
the city after the Worshippers of Sarku had taken my fief from me with some
excuse concerning  back taxes.  Prince Rereshqala was to provide me with a
legal remedy that would only take about a decade to get through the courts.
Meanwhile, I am to leave the empire temporarily to prevent attempts to
permanently remove me from my position.

I remember entering Jakalla  just before the riots started  coming in from
the north.

Everything was quiet, although there was an underlying restlessness to the
city.  I went to the clan house, and I understood that almost everynight the
lower classes were moving about on the streets looking for trouble.

I always had liked coming to Jakalla for the food riots in the Summer as it
made for good entertainment.  I had a usual position on the roof that I would
take and stand with my great bow, my faithful huntsman (Gubanu) who would
hold my arrows) and my messenger (Daragma) who would keep tally.  From that
position on top of the clan house I would spend many an evening firing my bow
into the rioters below and present the tally kept by Dargma for anyone who
would put a claim against me.  The cook, meanwhile would prepare Jakallan
tidbits.  And my wives and concubines would bet on which way the rioter would
fall when I hit them with an arrow.  It was rather an interesting pastime. 

It was from my usual position that I watched the riots in the streets
during the recent trouble.  What was unusual was that although there was not
the same intensity of rioting as during the annual summer food riots, there
seemed to be a darker purpose behind them.  Although there was the usual
groups of looters and rioters, there were other groups that seemed to move
and engage in acts with purpose.

Sometimes among the rioters you could smell the worm boys moving around.
You know that rotting, smell of decayed flesh, carelessly perfumed and no
regard for fashion.  You could almost detect them just beyond your vision,
dark shapes moving, directing the crowd.  I had a servent kidnapped by some
rioters and when I went to retrieve her, I was ambushed.  Not randomly, but
purposefully with hopes to kill me or worse, make me a plaything of the worm.
She was a famous singer and musician, given to me by the prince.  I saw the
Worm Bitch that cut off her hands. Even though healed, the musician lost some
of that magic of her playing.  I put the Worm Bitch who did that to her in
the frying pan right after we stormed the Temple of Sarku and listened to her
sizzle and pop.  Revenge is a dish best served in the Jakallan style:  Hot
and spicy!!!  Made a few enemies that day I'll tell you.

No one really seemed to know what to do.  Even the garrison troops as
they were, only set up roadblocks and did not consider clearing the streets
until directed by the prince.  The prince you know, did his best to stay out
of politics.  He told me so on several occasions.   Even our clan put
together a small force to help protect and block the intersection near the
entrance to our clan house.

The trouble with Jakalla is the extensive underworld that is half
habitated and half explored.  There are too many places for a worm to hide
down there.  I got lost down there once for a month, until my nose finally
led me to the basement of the Temple of Dlamelish.. there is a sweet musty
smell about that temple that one never quite forgets.....the fete following
my adventure cost me 50,000 kaitars and a few hlash....but that is not to be
recounted here.... although I do have found memories of the small, petite
brunette......oh well.

I believe the Sarku troops never really had a chance to take the city.
As a matter of fact, a good number of the Sarku troops as I recall actually
did not really want to follow their orders.  I remember one column of them
trying their best and the rest seemed to just be there for the show.  After
the danger was pretty much gone, but in plenty of time to make a brave
showing, strike a noble pose, claim glory and lead the final assault over the
nearly crumbled defenses I went to the Temple of Sarku and assisted in the
initial sacking of parts of the temple we could get to.  I remember lots and
lots and lots of traps.  The Sarku priests have been working on illusions so
elaborate that even persons trained in detecting and springing these traps
were fooled!!! ..... I remember persons from Onchash Chairon,  Illusion
Masters, who were fooled for months into believing whatever the Sarku
illusionists wove for them.  La!  but that is yet another story......The
Temple was sealed, I believe because the prince didn't want to lose troops
unnecessarily working there way through that viper's nest.  Best thing to do
is like the Muuglavyanie in Livyanu, just seal em up and keep moving.

After the city had been cleared, I went to the palace. There were  Sarku
troops stationed and ordered to hold the road outside of Prince Rereshqala's
palace and not let anyone pass without proper authority on the road.  I
simply left the road a few feet in front of them and used it again on the
other side of them.  That was no problem to them.  They really did not seem
to want to cause any trouble.  As a matter of fact, they assisted us in the
defense of Rereshqala's palace from what I can remember, although many were
lost in the fighting.

I will continue to look for my notes.  If there is any variance between
this and what The Truly Great One Phil remembers, Phil is right.

On the 21st of Dohala, 2366, Prince Taksuru Tlakotani marched forth from Bey Su
to Avanthar with the purpose of meeting with Emperor Dhichune.  He has not been
heard from again.

On the 23rd of Dohala the Council of the Priesthoods dispatched an envoy to the
Golden Tower to convey a challenge to the Emperor by an unspecified Imperial
Prince, calling into question the legitimacy of his rule.

With this envoy travelled a retinue, including several nobles and a squad
of soldiers as escorts.

Upon ariving at Avanthar via tubeway car, several members of the retinue 
disappeared.  Disguised among them were the Baron Ald of Yan Kor and 
Prince Mridobu Tlakotani.  Taking advantage of the Prince's secret knowledge
of his home in Avanthar, the squadron quickly entered the Golden Tower.
Even as the envoy was delivering his challenge to the Emperor, Dhich'une
was fleeing for his life from his half-brother and the Baron.

So it was that Emperor Hiriktashte, "Risen to Rule", ascended the Petal Throne.
His first act was to name Ald the High General of the Empire.  His second was
to seize the Council of the Priesthoods in Bey Su, and thereby set about
legitimizing his hold on the Throne.  All of Mridobu's staunchest supporters
were called in to begin the task of organizing and assuming control of the
Empire.  The bureacratic nightmare of taking over an empire the size of
Tsolyanu was underway.

But it was not to be.  On the 25th of Dohala the trap was apparently sprung.
Emerging from beneath Avanthar, through passages unknown even to the wily
Mridobu (and possibly new since Hirkane was deposed), swarms of Undead
emerged and overwhelmed the occupants of Avanthar.  Captives were not taken
and quarter was not given.  Individuals who did not fall to the sword of copper
were instead trampled beneath the feet of their ancestors, torn asunder by their
groping claws, or hurled bodily through the windows of the upper stories to 
perish in the river or on the land below.

Left largely undefended by the withdrawal of the forces of Ald, Mridobu and
Taksuru, the city of Bey Su was overwhelmed and interdicted.  No word nor 
refugee has emerged with news of what occurred.  Telepathic and magical
contacts with Bey Su and Avanthar are not possible.  The Hand of Sarku
has covered the mouth of the city.

Rumors abound concerning the recent events, but the concensus seems to be that
Dhich'une has once again skillfully executed a major coup.  Beginning with his
'betrayal' of Ald earlier this year, he set the stage for the elimination of
the entire Ksarul power structure, and the retaking of Bey Su.  By betraying
Ald, the General could ally with Taksuru and Mridobu.  Having done so, those
individuals were drawn out, and destroyed. 

It is now the second Intercalary day of 2366-2367.  In the city of Usenanu and
elsewhere about the Empire, the normally raucous celebrations are muted and
reserved.  Only the necessary and formal relgious rites are practiced to meet
the demands of doctrine.  The streets are not filled with revelers, the 
temples conduct ceremonies before small crowds of dour, anxious faces.
All wonder what new malaise the year 2367 A.S. shall bring.

The articles on Ksarul, Thumis and Sarku were fantastic. They contained
pretty much every thing I needed. What I was still curious about was if
there was a monastery of Ksarul near Jakalla, its name, signifigance, and
location.

On a slightly different topic. One aspect of Tekumel that I have always been
curious about is what type of decoration do the temples have? In India for
example the temples are covered in gorgeous statues paintings of Vishnu,
Shiva etc. Is this the case in Tsolyanu as well? If so what "style" of asian
art could you compare it to i.e. are they adorned in a style similar to say
the Balinese demon figures or, like the ruins at Angkor Vat? Or are the
temples similar to the Aztec Mayan etc pyramids of Central America? I would
like some type of comparison to show my players what the temples would look
like.

Is it possible to visit Tekumel and stay married on this world at the same 
time?  I have -- but, then, my lifestyle is somewhat different from most...

[Moderator's Note:  It hope so!  I intend to keep my wife.  :)               ]

Lord Tekunu is largely correct in his recollections. It must be pointed out 
that his avowed "hobby" of potting off peasants from the rooftop of his 
Jakalla clanhouse is NOT socially santioned. He has always used his high 
clan status (plus wealth, high lineage, etc.) to indulge his personal 
idiosyncrasies. His clan has paid out lots of Shamtla to his victims, and 
I think his clansmen were actually quite happy when he decided to leave 
Jakalla and take his bow elsewhere. -- Not that his actions are illegal 
in Tsolyanu, however: killing "rioters" can be justified as a loyal attempt 
to restore tranquility and protect the innocent. Those engaged in "rioting" 
are, clearly, acting against Imperial law and are thus liable to punishment. 
Lord Tekunu simply carries it over into his private avocation. This may 
seem deplorable to some, but it is borderline legal, and when Shamtla is 
paid to the aggrieved relatives, only the immediate families of the victims 
may still harbour grudges and seek revenge. (It was a good thing Lord Tekunu 
decided to depart when he did!) As a noble, obeying the dictates of Tsolyani 
"Nobility," Lord Tekunu did no wrong.

Those enemies are stilling looking for Tekunu. The kidnapping and maiming 
of the pretty musician was partial revenge for what Tekunu had done to 
the Worm Lord's interests. They will want more.

[Moderator's Note:  Woops!                                                   ]

All of this unrest has opened the gates to vigilante justice and oppor-
tunism.  Looting and murder are rampant, and the great clanhouses, 
temples, and businesses locked their doors and stayed inside until Prince 
Rereshqala's troops had restored a semblance of order. Now (mid-summer, 
2,367) there is quiet.

The temple of Sarku was initially sacked by mobs of looters, city guards, 
local contingents of the legions, and even temple guards from other 
temples! It was this that Lord Tekunu remembers so vividly. The temple 
was restored after he had left the city in the interests of order and 
peace between the sects. It's open for business as usual now. Prince 
Rereshqala apparently has no intention of destroying any sect or group; 
he only demands obedience to the law of the land and continued efforts 
to rebuild the Empire. His troops later punished a few of the most flagrant 
looters and those responsible for the burning of the sanctuary of Sarku. 
As said above, it was a good thing for Tekunu that he left the city when 
he did...

Almost everything Lord Tekunu relates is as it actually transpired. Here 
and there he differs in emphasis or minor detail from the way I recall 
it, but in the main his memories are accurate. What doesn't appear is 
what happened AFTER he had left Jakalla. This is thus rather like 
getting a news report for one particular day, in  one particular month, 
in one particular year, from Sarajevo: it doesn't present a long-term, 
ongoing picture of what is happening. It cannot (and does not purport to) 
give a larger view of events across the Empire. This is to be expected.

[Moderator's Note:  Professor Barker elaborates on Taksuru and the Message   ]
[                   Bob sent dealing with goings on in Dohala, 2366.         ]

This is another case of a very real issue: when one is ON Tekumel and 
can see only one's own personal surroundings, the view tends to be 
somewhat microscopic! It's like an individual's recollections of any 
historical event: the assassination of President Kennedy, the Battle 
of the Bulge, etc. Without the modern "global" view provided by TV, 
radio, newspapers, magazines, etc., it is hard to say what actually 
DID happen -- and even then, as we are all aware, there are differing 
theories, perceptions, ideas of "reality," and the like.

>Out here in the hinterlands, the last we'd heard of Prince Taksuru was

Lord Arjai left Bey Su near the end of 2,366. His present whereabouts 
on Tekumel's primary Plane are unknown. Hence, he missed much of what 
happened during the spring of 2,367. I can only partially fill this 
gap since I myself have not been back to Bey Su to "look" with any 
party of players since. 

[Moderator's Note:  Maybe a bit of background info on Taksuru would be     ]
[                   appropriate.  I just don't know much about him.  Could ]
[                   you elaborate a bit on him, Professor?                 ]

Prince Taksuru was not slain, nor has he disappeared. He sent out all of 
his available troops (some of the Bey Su legions, some city and temple 
guards, and a contingent of the Baron's soldiers from Yan Kor), plus 
hordes of city-dwellers armed with axes, clubs, and whatever. Dhich'une 
had no large garrison nearby -- Avanthar actually houses only a small 
number of defenders -- and in a pitched battle north of Bey Su, the 
Imperial forces were defeated (barely!) and sent fleeing back into 
Avanthar. Taksuru regrouped and camped where he was. (It was at this 
point, I think, that Lord Arjai's party left the area.)

After some weeks of fruitless parleying with Eselne's emissaries, 
then Mirusiya's, and finally Rereshqala's, Taksuru saw that his 
position was increasingly fragile, and he ordered a retreat into 
Bey Su. His troops are now esconced in tye city and are in full control.

The "Darkness" which Dhich'une had called down upon Bey Su was dissipated 
by Ksarul priests summoned from the ancient stronghold of Hmakuyal. The 
skies are now clear, and the mood of desolation and oppression is now 
gone -- replaced by a very real mood of grim apprehension mingled with 
some hope for a compact between the Princes.
 
>On the 21st of Dohala, 2366, Prince Taksuru Tlakotani marched forth from Bey 
>Su
>to Avanthar with the purpose of meeting with Emperor Dhichune.  He has not

This is incorrect. If Lord Arjai had stayed, he would have seen the 
Prince's somewhat-less-than-triumphal return into the city.

What follows is essentially correct. The attempt to put Mridobu on the 
Petal Throne was not due to Taksuru but to a plot within the Temple of 
Ksarul to put a known quantity -- the stable and efficient burueacrat, 
Mridobu -- on the Throne.

Actually, Mridobu had learned that Dhich'une had been summoned to the 
City of Sarku to attend a very special High Ceremony for the Worm Lord. 
Of course, it is absolutely illegal for an Emperor to leave the Golden 
Tower, but this would not be the first time a monarch had slipped out 
for some important reason.  Hence, Mridobu knew in advance that Dhich'une 
would not be "at home," and he counted upon this for success.

>So it was that Emperor Hiriktashte, "Risen to Rule", ascended the Petal 
>Throne.

This was Mridou's choice of a throne-name. Not too prophetic, it turned out...

He didn't have to "seize" the Council of Priesthoods. He already had 
large numbers of the senior politicians on the temple staffs in his 
figurative pocket, and all he had to do was threaten Prince Taksuru's 
supporters with temple retribution if they objected to him. Most gave 
in rather meekly, but Taksuru himself was not ready to give up.

This is apprently true, although no one knows whether Prince Mridobu was 
among the dead. It IS known that Baron Ald escaped, fighting his way down 
to the tubeway cars and back to Yan Kor. He's been sighted there recently.
 
>Left largely undefended by the withdrawal of the forces of Ald, Mridobu and

This is true. Lord Arjai cannot have known of what transpired afterward. 
The Hand of Sarku has now been mostly lifted. Prince Mirusiya made an 
abortive assault on Avanthar but was driven back. Now, it is learned, 
he and Taksuru have combined with the Baron to make yet another attack 
on the fortress, and this time they are determined to win or perish.

This was TRIED, but the rumours are just that: rumours. He betrayed Baron 
Ald indeed, but the Baron got back to Yan Kor, spent some time "mending 
fences" within his shaky alliance of city-states and local interests, 
and is now once again meddling in Tsolyani politics. He is said to be 
with Prince Mirusiya -- though some say he himself is still in Yan Kor 
but has sent his leman, the inimitable Fu Hsi, and possibly Lady Deq 
Dimani (with her Tsolyani comrade, Lady Kalusu hiViridame) to lead the 
Yan Koryani contingent.

This is reasonably true as reported. The difficulty is only that it is 
a "gnat's eye" view of events. Even I have no information about many of 
these things, particularly of what goes on inside the Sarku camp. It is 
now mid-summer, 2,367, and my party of player-characters has opted to go 
and live in a small, remote fief northeast of Sokatis on the Salarvyani 
border. There, they are bothered only by the Ssu, the Salarvyani, various 
demons, ghosts, and local peasants...

Wish them well as they bravely face the Unknown...!

[                   art.                                                      ]

Glad you enjoyed the articles. The nearest Ksarul monastery -- aside from 
small, local "city" monasteries and temples within Jakalla itself, lies to 
the west in the great ruined city of Hmakuyal. You might ask Lord Arjai 
hiVaisoner about it -- he hails from there. I cannot think of any other 
one near Jakalla, which doesn't mean there isn't any! The Temple of the 
Lord of the Blue Room is not known for putting up public billboards!

You can see pictures of various temples here and there in the literature.

[                   is just so much to do, and so little time.... sigh.. :) ]

The old Journal article on the Temple of Ksarul had a little sketch (mine) 
of one of the temples, and there have been others. The external walls of 
most temples tend to be carved and painted with mythological scenes. Not 
completely from top to bottom, the way the great temples of South India 
(e.g. the Minakshi temple in Madurai) are crammed with sculpture, but in 
long friezes of statuary, bas reliefs, and mosaic done in bands along 
the upper area of a temple wall. The temples differ, too: Lord Hru'u's 
temples usually have only plain outer walls, with single statues placed 
here and there; Lord Vimuhla's walls are often plain, although in the 
eastern Sokatis style (influenced by Salarvyani baroque art), great 
processions of priests, gods, kinds, and mythological figures line the 
upper registers and crawl all over the domes and porticoes. Lady 
Dlamelish is strangely demure about her temples: they tend to be of one 
storey only, entered by climbing broad stairs under lowering colonnades, 
and sculpted high up with grotesque gargoyles and depictions of her 
various Aspects. Inside, her shrines are a riot of what one might term 
NC17 art! Lord Thumis prefers stately processionals of priests and 
mythological scenes from the Epics, while Lord Hnalla is fond of 
geometric designs in eye-boggling detail. Sarku's temples are ponderous, 
usually brown or ochre stone, with twisting, fearsome images of the Worm 
Lord placed at gateways and on pylons around them. Lord Belkhanu and Lord 
Karakan use various types of friezes or statuary, mosaics, and bas reliefs 
that differ widely from place to place, although as one might expect, 
Lord Belkhanu's colours tend to be yellow, while Lord Karakan prefers 
crismson. Lady Avanthe's shrines are often of translucent blue glass, 
with scenes made of glass or coloured crystals inset into the walls. 
Her fountains are legendary, particular in Katalal and Thraya. This is 
about all that can be said in so short a space. Temples differ in style 
and decoration from place to place and also from era to era. A temple 
built in "Late Ensgvanyali" style will look like a floating vision of 
shimmering glass, while the blocky, heavy, Bednalljan genres appear 
fearsome, ponderous, and awesome.

A full discussion of Tsolyani art styles and religious iconography would 
require a set of encyclopaedias! Maybe I'll get around to sketching some 
of them one day...

I hope this helps a little.

[                   about Taksuru.                                           ]

Prince Taksuru is another of the "hidden" Princes. The Tsolyani encourage 
the great clans, temples, and powerful families to take one of the Emperor's 
children just after birth and bring him or her up away from the Court. In 
this way, te reasoning goes, the empire will be assured of candidates who 
are not just pampered and spoiled princelings, who have no experience 
with reality. For this reason, Prince Mirusiya was handed over to the Vriddi 
clan of Fasiltum, and he grew up there not knowing who he was until the 
Omnipotent Azure Legion was instructed to offer him the "Gold." The clan 
saw to his education, training, and progress, and if he had shown signs 
of weakness, they would have quietly shunted him off to live out his life 
as a simple clansman somewhere. They would have reported his failings to 
the Omnipotent Azure Legion, and the latter would never have given him a 
chance at the Throne.

Thus it was with Taksuru hiTlakotani. He was raised in the Cloak of Azure
Gems clan in Bey Su and was told he was a Viridame, an old and famous
lineage. He was educated in the temple schools, entered the priesthood 
of Lord Ksarul, and was trained in a variety of fighting and scholarly 
skills. His tutors never told him who he was but quietly encouraged him 
to enroll in the subjects they knew he would need for the Kolumejalim, 
the "Choosing of Emperors."

He was contacted by various agents of the Throne, as well as his temple 
authorities, and the consensus was that he would someday be ripe for 
revealing: when the time came, an agent of the Petal Throne would appear 
and offer him the "Gold." (He now says that he guessed his true identity 
as early as his twelfth birthday, when his teachers discouraged him from 
learning music and art and directed him towards sorcery and unarmed 
combat skills instead.) 

He remained under the eagle eyes of his clan, his temple, and the 
Omnipotent Azure Legion all during his adolescence. Eventually he was 
introduced to Lady Kalusu hiViridame, who was of the same lineage but of 
a different clan (Hand of Darkness). She is a "Marek": an ancient and 
secretive body of guardians who are charged with watching over important 
people, candidates for the Throne, and the like, without ever revealing 
their identities or powers. Taksuru liked her, but she was not terribly 
fond of him, being smitten with a certain powerful northern ruler and 
having higher plans for herself than "playing nursemaid" (as she put 
it) to a young man (who was almost the same age!).

Taksuru grew up to be a handsome, rather serious, taciturn young man. He 
is strong, intelligent, always balanced and watchful, and quite talented. 
Whether he is good enough to defeat the other candidates for the Petal 
Throne or not remains to be seen. He is not equal to Dhich'une in sorcery, 
nor to Eselne in sheer physical power, nor to Rereshaqala in diplomacy, 
nor to Mirusiya in leadership of troops. But Taksuru's combination of 
talents may be enough to survive, especially since the others are weaker 
than he is in one or more of the requisite talents.

The temple of Ksarul prefers him over Mridobu, who was more of a bureaucrat 
and less fervent in his religious observances. Prince Mridobu would have 
kept Taksuru from being revealed, however, because he himself wanted to 
be his temple's candidate, and his clique within the temple and Imperial 
power structure could have kept those who favoured Taksuru away from the 
limelight.  Mridobu lost his chance when Dhich'une out-manouevred him and 
got to the Petal Throne after Hirkane died (or was slain). Now it's too 
late, probably, for Mridobu. He may even be already dead.

Taksuru is thus the only hope of the Ndalu Clan and related factions in 
the temples of Hru'u, Gruganu, and Wuru. He is acceptable to the other 
temples because he seems to be a balanced and non-fanatic young man, who 
would not rock too many boats or take out his pique upon those who disagreed 
with him. He can get along, it is thought, even with Hnalla, Thumis, and 
Belkhanu, although he has little to recommend him to Karakan, Vimuhla, 
or to Avanthe and Dlamelish. At least he is not openly hostile.

In view of current political developments, Taksuru has had to make an 
uneasy alliance with Prince Mirusiya and the Vimuhla faction. Politics 
does indeed make strange bedfellows. It is rumoured that some deal has 
been struck which leaves Mirusiya on the throne and Taksuru as Chancellor
-- or vice-versa, perhaps, with Tksuru as Emperor and Mirusiya as First 
General. How this will play out is not yet known, if such a deal exists 
at all.

The Baron of Yan Kor has worked with Taksuru, after he had learned his 
lesson from Dhich'une's duplicity and betrayal. He may have something 
to say about all of this, of course, as may Rereshqala and Eselne. The other 
Princes and Princess Ma'in can probably be safely ignored.

There is much more to this story, but this will have to do for the present.

[Moderator's Note:  Evan fires another round of questions and the Professor  ]
[                   replies.                                                 ]

Dear Evan,

Pechano is an interesting place. One of our current characters has 
friendly relations with the king (the Chaegosh; cf. Sourcebook p. 75). 
The Pechani consider Ssu-hunting rather as the British think of "riding 
to the hounds." They often treat guests to hunting parties that are meant 
to demonstrate heroism -- often foolhardiness -- and cameraderie: sort 
of a Norse Valhalla crossed with a Victorian fox-hunting party -- tallyho, 
and all that!
 
>1)The government. Is the country on a constant military "footing"? How 
>do the leaders of the realm rule? What type of leader do they have in 
>Pechano?  A king, A Baron (like in Yan Kor), A military dictatorship? 
>Does the constant threat mean that a state of martial law is in effect 
>on a regular basis?

As you can see from p. 75 of the Sourcebook, the Chaegosh is the oligarch 
of the old ruling clan of Mechaneno, the Beneshchan. Since no land is 
actually ever truly "sold," a buyer becomes the "vassal" of the person 
from whom he buys the land. Make sure your players understand this, or 
they could end up serving dinner in some lord's feudal hall! Pechano is, 
of course, thoroughly oriented towards war, particularly against he Ssu 
but also against the great leviathan of Salarvya to the south. Pechani 
children learn several types of fighting the moment they are able to 
walk. Heroism is highly valued, and prowess is measured in terms of 
"kills." The Pechani seem harsh and taciturn to the more "refined" 
Tsolyani, but they are essentially decent folk who practice the casual 
brutality of a feudal warrior society.

>2)The military. What type of army does Pechano have? How good are their 
>troops? Do they see much "action", or are they just a show army that 
>occasionaly fights off a Ssu raid? How are they organised? Along what 
>lines? Are they similar to the Tsolyani or more like the Salarvyani? 
>Or uniquely Pechani?

Volume V of the "Armies of Tekumel" series (xeroxed only) contains a 
list of Pechani "Nchesh" (the Salarvyani term borrowed for "legion"): 
pp. 22-27. Perhaps you can persuade Chris Davis to copy the Filemaker 
Pro dataase section on Pechani legions, so that you can get their names 
and those of their generals. It's in the "Warriors and Soldiers" 
character list, which has not yet been put up on tye FTP site. The 

[Moderator's Note:  I'll see what I can do, Evan.  The Professor has sent me ]
[                   quite a bit of stuff to go through, with the hopes that  ]
[                   it will get on the ftp site at some point.               ]
"Armies of tekumel" series is mostly out of print now, but some kind 
soul could mail you a xerox of the xeroxs -- I'd do it myself, but I don't 
have time right now. Briefly, the Pechani army is organised much like the 
Salarvyani, with a strongly feudal basis. The troops of the Rekhmel lineage 
don't like fighting beside those of the Beneshchan family, and constant 
duelling and "offenses of honour" make cooperation perilous at best. 
Read pp. 71-75 of the Sourcebook for an overview.

[Moderator's Note:  I am not sure I have Armies of Tekumel 5, but If I do, I ]
[                   will try to send you a copy.  As a matter of fact, I do  ]
[                   have most of them, maybe I'll see if some of our volun-  ]
[                   teer typists can type them in.  If they aren't too long. ]

>3)The priesthoods. Which of Pavars dieties are worshipped in Pechano 
>and are any held in "more regard" than others? I don't see someone 
>like Thumis being more widely worshipped than Lord Karakan or Vimuhla. 
>Are the priesthoods of Pechano more on a spiritual "plane" or on a 
>secular one.  Do they operate like the Livyani clergy?

The Gods of Pechano are the "Seven Deities of the Rising Peaks"; cf. 
the Sourcebook, p. 54. These are essentiially similar -- though not 
identical to -- Thumis, Karakan, Vimuhla, Avanthe-Dlamelish (like 
Shiringgayi in Salarvya), Ksarul, Belkhanu, and two local ones: Quoth 
the Many-Eyed, and the warrior-hero Nyesset of the Pinnacle. Religion 
in Pechano plays a minor role, compared to Tsolyanu, and the priesthoods 
are not held in as high esteem as the warrior lineages. The priesthoods 
do have monasteries, but they are not government-funded. 
 
>4)Foreigners. Many of the realms on Tekumel appear to be quite xenophobic.
>Do the Pechani also suffer from this to a large degree? Is there an OAL
>or a Vru'uneb type of organisation(s) present in the realm? How restricted
>is the movement of foreign nationals (if at all)?

The Pechani honour "heroic" foreigners, including Aridani women. They 
treat women quite well, in general, and female soldiers and heroines 
are honoured and are the subject of "heroic" epic poems. Foreigners 
can move fairly freely through Pechano, but the local feudal society 
may harbour a few whimsical, cruel, or downright unpleasant individuals, 
who may rob or seize small parties of unprotected foreigners. Getting 
the backing of the Chaegosh (king) is thus as VERY good thing -- or the 
support of the oligarchs of the Rekhmel lineage of Teshkoa. The Pechani 
do have police forces, road guards, and "royal agents," but nothing so 
fancy as the Omnipotent Azure Legion. 

Good luck with Pechano!

[Moderator's Note:  Bob Dushay asks about sea travel around the Five Empires.]

>What is sea travel really like around the Five Empires?  We know that

>I had assumed ships come close to land and drop anchor for the night,

>ships closer to shore do so?

Passenger and cargo vessels are usually the larger square-rigged Tnek. 
These hug the coasts and travel from port to port during daylight hours, 
with only a few longer stretches requiring night travel. Most skippers 
also have regular pilots whom they hire on for voyages in unfamiliar 
waters. The faster war-galleys have too little space and too restricted 
food supplies to do much open-sea travel.  There are certain well-known 
crossings, however: e.g. the one you mentioned across from Salarvya to 
Haida Pakala, which is about 600 Tsan at its best point.  There are 
regular pilots and navigators who know these waters well and who are 
familiar with seasons, tides, currents, and dangers. Otherwise,there 
isn't a lot of ocean sailing -- though Magellan, Columbus, and others 
made difficult voyages over open waters in our own history. It's not 
impossible; it's just perilous and time-consuming! For people who just 
want to travel from Jakalla to Kheiris or to Tsatsayagga, it's best to 
get a cabin on one of the regular merchantmen that perform this kind 
of service.
 
>Are some areas of ocean known to be monster infested, while others 
>are known to be safer?  This could explain why some open ocean sailing 
>is done, but not a lot of it.

There are indeed "famous" creature-infested regions: e.g. the "Shoals of 
the Akho," south of Salarvya. Sea travel is not as dangerous as I 
inadvertently made out in the old "Empire of the Petal Throne" rules. 
In the interests of providing an exciting game, I had sea monsters 
popping up everywhere!  There are more and bigger leviathans on Tekumel 
than on old Earth, but not so many that travel would become impossible! 
I thus always make a confirming dice roll whenever I produce a really 
large critter during a sea voyage in the game.  Sea travel is one of the 
best ways of getting people and cargo from one place to another relatively 
fast, and if it were as difficult as I had originally made it, there would 
be a great decrease in commerce!

Stick to the coasts for cargo and passenger travel, and hire a good pilot 
for open-water voyages.  Very few navigators would ever try to sail out 
to the Isle of Eyes or the lost little city of Mardza on the Isles of 
Ill Wind!

Navigators have simple compasses (a magnetised needle and a pot of oil). 
Steering by the positions of the moons and planets is common, and there 
are ephemerides that tell the sailor where these bodies will be in the 
sky on any given night of the year.  Since there are no stars, there are 
no fixed reckoning points (like Polaris on Earth), but the configur-
ations of the heavenly bodies give considerable information, which, 
combined with experience and navigational know-how, usually get the 
traveller from one place to another.

Take care -- and beware the deadly Akho of the Deeps!

[Moderator's Note:  Tekunu recounts information about his seafaring         ]
[                   adventures.                                             ]

Sea Travel:

I have adventured on the sea as Achan Tlashte; Tekunu hi'Qolyelmu; Matlor
and even role played a pearl-diver (I can't remember his name).  I have
sailed with Phil at the helm for a number of years and have a detailed
description (and maps) of most of the coastal hexes (location of fresh water,
villages, ruins and the like) in Tsolyanu, Mu'uglavya and some of Salarvya
and some of Livyanu, part of the southern continent, a section of the far
side of the planet, and islands in between.  (It's my rudder and I haven't
decided how much I can find)

Having been on the seas for about a quarter of my 20 years of playing
Tekumel, I would agree with the Great One: If you stick with the commercial
vessels and take the major routes you can travel comfortably and safely, but
as soon as you get out of the well traveled areas you are in danger from 
some of the more fearsome monsters of the deep.  It's really not all that 
often, but it's kind of like an airplane crash, its usually fatal.

Then on the other hand most people who adventure on Tekumel go into area
looking for trouble. Like Earth Prime if you look for adventure and trouble
you will find it.  For instance I sailed with Captain Pi'ur in search of The
Great White Akho: Moab hi'Dikh.  We generally only ran into trouble when we
left the major sea lanes to take a "short cut".  Well there usually is a
reason why ships don't travel through "short cuts" on the map.  It's because
it may be mating grounds for some underwater nasty or a ghost ship may be
haunting the area or there may be a sea weed bed that has spider like
creatures crawling all over it or a host of other reasons.  I can't remember
getting into much trouble except with pirates in the sea lanes.   I have seen
all sorts of things on the water and I would imagine 90% of the trouble was
because of where we were (our choice) and not a random roll of the die (The
Great One's). 

Here are parts of my journal from a trip from Jakalla along the coast of
Salarvya to Dlanta Isle:

We have continued along the way for several weeks now and we have not had any
adventures. We set into the port of Petris Layoda.  We have decided to take
the wife of one of the adventurers along.  Palanes is coming along.  One
slave is taken along to take care of the wife.   10th of Fesru we take sail.
On day three we see three ships fighting. One is a Tsolyani ship full of
adventurers, there is a Muuglavyani Swamp Folk Ship, and a merchant vessel. 

Use massed combat to fight the battle.  In the leap over we lost several
of the marines and the captain of the marine. The swamp folk are backing away
from us, as they are backing away from the ship's crew. The swamp folk are
fighting at the other merchant vessel.  Tekunu was the first over the side of
the vessel, and Gubanu and Daragma followed.  I was critically wounded in the
fight and fell. The marines fight across the vessel. Tekunu is healed and
then engages the enemy captain in single combat and slays him.

We left the enemy ship with no loot, the pirate ship went one way and we
went the other.  We lost two marines and gained three sailors from the sunk
merchantman.  (Hex 1814)

7th of Fesru.  Hex 1815 this day.  We run into four Akho who attack the
ships. There is one large, two very large and one huge Akho.  Three attack
the other ship, one attacks our ship.  The tentacles come up out of the ocean
and attempting to seize sailors.  We drive off our Akho.  Two of the other
three are attacking the ship.  The largest off is under the ship.  We
approach and fire the port ballista and hit one that is crawling aboard the
other ship.  Tekunu fires the bow and damages the other. Two tenticles come
aboard and attack the crew, knocks down Tekunu.  It gets several strikes at
the ship.   We drive the Akho off the other ship.   We pick up several
sailors that are swimming in the water. We lost another marine.  They lost
two sailors, a marine and a cook.

We run into a boat in the middle of the night.  We run into a round Hlutrgu
coracle. It is full of dead bodies. They smell pretty bad.  It is Fesru and
they are migrating between the continents.   By dawn the sea is littered with
little coracles. There are a few of the coracles that have critters. We go
to Hex 1716. We turn away from them rather than take the chance of being
attacked. 

[Moderator's Note:  Coracles are the little leather ships Hlutrgu use.     ]

We see more ships on the horizon but they do not come close to us at all.
That night we hit something that causes the ship to go boom, crunch and we
find a number of Hlutrgu coracles under the bow.  They are already dead. 

Brea plays the Zarur on the bow of the ship.  The ship's crew is happy to
hear her playing.  My servant, Gubanu is in love with Kayel.    

We reach hex 1616 on the 10th of Fesrul. We run into a ship from Salarvya. 
It is the coastal patrol and we pay taxes so that we can get documents to 
allow us further on the coast.  We also run into a Livyani ship suffering 
from scurvy and the like. We give them some fresher food and continue. 

We appraoch the tropical paradise of Songyal. Brea plays the Zarur on the
bow of the ship and the crew appears to be content as we have not encoun-
tered an adventure in several days. We may even make it as far as the 
Dlantla Isle.  We see ships on the coast of the Isle. We make the Isle 
by sunset.  There are numerous reefs and rocks near the shore.  The cap-
tain knows these waters.  We have been out for five days and we stop to 
get fresh water before we continue to run.  We pay 100 kaitars to stay, 
they will give us anchorage and water, we must pay for food.  Up the 
street are the food places and room for the night. The whores are up 
the road.  I send Kagor out for food.

Kagor comes back to say that six or seven people wish to go to another 
port.  They wish to go to Dlanta Isle or to Haida Pakala.  We can take 
them to Dlanta Isle, passage can be had for 300 Kaitars a passage.  We 
sail on the morning tide after the food is taken aboard the ship.  There 
is a cool grey sea, birds are screaming overhead.  A man comes with the 
bread, it is a little crusty, but alright to eat.  A cart makes its way 
down the street.  Two slovenly Salarvyani are bringing the bread.  Six 
members of the crew come down with rickets or scurvy.  Kagar comes back 
with supplies.  The tide is ready to go out at noon, the weather is 
getting to be a little rough.  The ship castes out and the sea is rough.  
We head to the south.  There are some villages, some precipitous rocks.  
The main port. Many fishing vessels, small crafts of all kinds.  A great 
many soldiers, fortifications, ratty could not hold off a determined 
assault.

We travel slowly along.   We are in the company of five or six other 
ships.  They are Salarvyani vessels with black hulls, military cut but 
not prepared for battle.  The children of the foreigner are playing a 
flute like instrument.  It is played with both hands in Haida Pakala.  
I invite the foreigner to dinner. 3 males, 4 wives and 3 children.   We 
are on the edge of hex 1417. There is a brisk breeze and we have dinner 
as best as we can.  We eat on the afterdeck.  We eat with them, to the 
east of Haida Pakals.  Nyemesel Island.  They wear helmets made of shell, 
bone and wood. Language is the popping of many farts all at once.  He 
has relatives that are ship's captains.  He knows many persons who can 
guide us.  The captain is invited to the dinner.  He is in Gorulu.   
Nyemsel Isles, ruins along the coast.  Rumors far away where the Ahoggya 
dwell.  The Ahoggya have laws that change every day depending upon who 
is in charge, the astrology will casue the laws to change. 

There are islands to the east of Salarvya that have black persons on them.
Brea then begins to blow on the flute.  She played the Zaror.   A little
girl appears to be a thief.   The morning passes the day passes without any
trouble.  Any one who gets sea sick will do so now.  We continue to sail
along for awhile.  Some of the water barrels have leaked and spoiled some of
the grain.  It is in the grain bin.

Kayel says that she must leave our service.  She must go away at this time.
She will only have sex with males as part of her employment.  Other than
that she wants to have nothing to do with us.   She will not do so willingly
but will do it as part of her job. A party member pisses her off and she 
does not wish to be around with someone who is interested in her.  The 
various ship persons are doing there work.  

There is an explosion off the bow.  A huge rising bubble comes up to the
surface and causes trouble.  Small bubbles come up and explode when they 
near the surface.  Stench of the gas within the bubbles is terrible. Swamp 
gas but only more troublesome.  The sea is bright green and luminescense.  
Tiny little swimming things in the sea below.  The Haida Pekalani say there 
is a wildlife that when it rots under the sea, the things are rising and 
even ships can be destroyed in the ocean.  Bits of vegetation remain and 
all kinds of things come to the surface to feed on the creatures.  They 
come up from the bottom to eat and they are creatures are not normally 
seen on the surface.  Some have lights on them.  I take notes for my 
journal on the southern continent.  This is a uncommon event.

On the 15th we are in 1218.  The rigging is humming and we are traveling 
at a fast rate across the ocean.  We are traveling at a good rate.  We 
batten the hatches.  The Salarvyani woman is alone in her cabin.  A sailor 
has fallen overboard and dissappeared.  We get The Eye of the Goddess 
(Dlamelish) or St. Elmo's Fire gets into the rigging. Bria is ill and 
is sick to her stomach.  Kagor is unable to cook.  Lord Tekunu is also 
getting sick.  

On the 16th we get to hex 1119.  The day still dawns pearly gray and is 
pink and misty.  We have a tough day trying to keep everything together.  
The little girl was sacrificed to Mretten, kind of like Avanthe with more 
to do with the sea.  It appears that the little girl was required to 
appease the goddess.  The man blamed Lord Tekunu that such things were 
his fault. They do not speak to anyone else on the ship during the course 
of the storm.  

On the 17th we get to the eye of the storm and the heat builds up.  It
appears like the sacrifice worked.  There is a difficulty on the ship, 
Kama-A senses an aura of a curse about the captain.  The captain may be 
cursed.  She screwed the Captain but she cannot feel comfortable as he 
has the feeling of doom about him.  She can read psychic emanations from 
the others. Sometime the last night there was a sacrifice.  Kama-A has 
noticed the emanations for several days.  The Captain like he is already 
in the tomb.  We have had these troubles since before the Tsongyal Isle.  
We may have had this trouble after the contact with the Livyani ship.  
The Captain may have caught the plague.  We have no idea if whether the 
Captain really is cursed or not. We cannot tell whether he is really 
cursed, he feals fine, there are no difficulties.  We attempt a 
Disenchantment spell in order to have the Captain feal better.  An 
examination of the Captain determines that there is an aura about him 
and he is ill.  The Disenchantment is attempted and we do no know if he 
is cured.  Visitation to determine if there are any extra planer 
connection. We cannot determine if there are any trouble with this 
curse, the Captain does not feal a thing at this time.    A diagram is 
made that entraps the entity.  It is short, squat and amorphous and 
vaguely frog-like looking. It is sitting in the Captain's shadow. He can 
see it out of the corner of his eye. Kama-Eh cannot see the shadow demon. 
They are creatures of the sea. They live in caverns in the ocean and the 
vegetation on the bottom of the sea. They manifest themselves with St. 
Elmo's fire. They cause doom. They cannot kill you, they eat your soul 
and you become like them. They will cause you to lose money and the like. 
For years this thing may follow you before the kill occurs. It can
go further back into shadows. 

Procession up the trail, and an old woman comes up the stair. Heavy set

[Moderator's Note:  Listmember Shawn Garbett contributes the following.      ]

I was reading a Science News the other day and it mentioned the
concept of global warming causing a hypercane. Essentially it
was saying that if global temperatures passed a critical point,
then hurricanes could overcome one big limiting factor they
are subject too now. Hurricanes top out against some layer
of the atmosphere and don't have enough power to get any bigger
because of this, but if temperatures got hot enough then this
layer could be puntured and Hypercanes (that's the term the
author coined) could occur. Now Tekumel is already there in
terms of heat, so what does this list think about the
possibiliy of a hypercane. It would be a perfect manifestation
of Origob, flipping sections of continents over, etc, etc.
Shenyu would be the most likely target, but one could
hit any coastal region during the summer months. Penom 
after the surge would have about 3 or 4 feet of mud deposited
and anything that wasn't a pyramid would be gone. The insect
population would surge because of the amount of large decaying
organic matter.

[Moderator's Note:  David Cheng updates us on the Tekumel-Con.  I will be out]
[                   of town starting tomorrow (Saturday) and won't be back   ]
[                   until Thursday.                                          ]

Here is a very brief update on what's going on with Tekumel-Con planning:

DATE
I've been working inhuman hours lately, and unable to devote enough 
time to con organization tasks.  I now think Spring of 1997 is a more
reasonable target date.  I like using national holiday weekends; how
does May 24-27 (Memorial Day Weekend) sound to you?  Or, would you
rather use more vacation time and have less crowding on your plane?

COST
This is _tentative_, but I think con registration will be in the
$35-40 range, with participation in the LARP an extra $10-15. 
I've made a first pass through the literature the hotels have sent me.
It looks like room rates will be in the $60-75/night range.

I know this looks a little steep at first glance, but I feel it's
justified for a few reasons:
1) Have you seen how rates for ~average~ cons have gone up lately?
2) Tekumel-Con will be a classy event at a good hotel.
3) This might very well be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.  We're 
   going to do our best to make you feel it was worth every cent.

GEOGRAPHY
As mentioned before, Tekumel-Con will be held in Minneapois,
Minnesota.  I am concentrating my hotel search on places right by the
mega-Mall of America.  Not only is this very close to the airport
(free shuttle service), but if you're bringing family, it gives them a
big attraction/distraction too (free shuttle to the Mall).

LIVE-ACTION ROLE-PLAYING
Work on the LARP is coming along, albeit slowly.  We are going to
shoot for about 75 players in the game (which will be a good chunk of
the attendees, I figure).  It will be more fun than you can imagine.

APPEAL
We need feedback on the ideas presented above.  We need volunteers for
event judges and front-desk-help.  We still really need someone in the
Minneapolis area to tour a few hotels.  Please contact me directly if
you can help with any of these.


More as things develop,

[Moderator's Note:  Evan has some final questions about Pechnano.          ]

>You made reference to some of the major houses in Pechano namely the 
>clans: Beneshchan and  Rekhmel. Are these the only two clans of note 
>in Pechano or are there others as well. How are there relations towards 
>each other? Does a Machiavellian atmosphere exist between them? Are 
>assassinations and blackmail etc a common way of doing business as far 
>as these two are concerned? 

There are perhaps 50 clans in Pechano. No one has ever done a census. The 
Beneshchan and Rekhmel lineages are the biggest and most powerful. Some 
are remote mountain clans, almost equivalent to "tribes." A few are 
occupation-based: bakers, wine-makers, carters, smiths, butchers, arms 
and armour-makers, and the like. A couple are religious in nature: 
secretive and devoted to their deities.

>About the deities of Pechano. Is there any more info you can give on the
>following items. What are the names of the "Seven Dieties of the Rising 
>Peaks" in the Pechani language. 

Chris, the article I sent you by Ksamanduish the Traveller contains 
brief descriptions of the Pechani deities. Please xerox and quote this 
to Evan. Or put it into e-mail and send him a copy -- or put it up on 
the FTP site where he can download it.

[Moderator's Note:  The Document in question will be added to the ftp site  ]
[                   as soon as I get to the office and can add it.          ]

Briefly, they are: (1) Thumis = Tsomeq; (2) Karakan-Vimuhla = Vihar; 
(3) Avanthe-Dlamelish = Sehta; (4) Ksarul = Kazherh; (5) Sarku-Belkhanu = 
Su'urkha; (6) Quoth the Many-Eyed; (7) Nyesset the Hero. Quoth is said to be 
"King of the Gods.

What are some of the ceremonies of Neyesset and Quoth?

Not much is known. Their worshippers gather together in processions and 
march through the mountains to remote shrines, where animals and fruits 
are sacrificed and eaten in large feasts. There are many epics and heroic 
legends. I don't have much more on this topic -- we never gamed over there.

>The Chaegosh. How is he appointed to his position? Does he have to

>or is his position hereditary? Does only the Beneshchan rule or can

>Tsolyani Emperor?

The Chaegosh is selected by his clan. The position is not hereditary, 
but it tends to become almost so by virtue of the fact that his 
lineage and his entourage make up themost powerful people in the land. 
Usually the Beneshchan have ruled, again by virtue of power and proxmity 
to the ancient throne of Mechaneno. A few Rekhmel rulers are quoted in 
the histories, as are a sprinkling of members of other clans a long time 
ago. The Chaeogosh is not secluded but goes forth with his heroes to hunt 
Ssu and lead heroic expeditions into old Ssuyal. The current Chaeogsh is 
a youngish man who calls himself just "Beneshchan," as is the custom. If 
he ever had a personal name, it is never used. He is flamboyant, loves 
gambling and drink, and fights very well. He is said to follow Vihar. He 
is quite hospitable, as long as his guests enjoy endless hunting parties, 
bouts of drinking, Ssu-fighting, and challenges to display bravery. He 
often gives the winners wives -- or male spouses, if the contestant be 
female -- and encourages joyful public coupling at one of his feasts in 
order to produce more heroes for the Seven Gods!

>How did Pechano come to exist? Did a group of Salarvyani clans break
>away from the rest of the country and make a go of it? It would seem 
>that this is not unlikely what with all the similarities between the

Pechano is one of the daughter-states of the old Engsvanyali Empire. 
The Priestkings split the region into two Governorships: one based 
in Tsatsayagga, the other in Mechaneno. The southern one expanded, 
while the northern one remained small and limited, locked in eternal 
battle with the Ssu. There are indeed many similarities between 
Pechano and Salarvya, but the Pechani are much more open, less greedy, 
and more harebrained and heroic.

>On a lighter note when I mentioned to one of my players that Ssu

The Pechani are not fond of Ahoggya, but they tolerate them -- and put 
them right up front in battle with the Ssu. They hardly know what a 
Pe Choi looks like, although some travellers and merchants have seen them, 
of course. 

[Moderator's Note:  One of the first characters I had was an Ahoggya, and I  ]
[                   think I can say that most only tolerate the Ahoggya (with] 
[                   the exception of the Shen!).                             ]

Send your group down to the ruins near Ssuganar: old Ssyrayal, which I 
believe you mentioned to Chris. (Where did you find out about this place? 
Did I mention it in a book somewhere?) It's called the "Sideways City",
because many of the old subterranean levels were lifted and turned almost 
exactly on their sides by earthquakes right after the Time of Darkness
began. What used to be floors are now walls, etc. It's amusing to have 
somebody step confidently out of a tubeway car (which has its own
internal gravity) and try to walk towards the far wall of the great 
station. It's a long and deadly fall "down" to that wall now!

Ssurayal has only one inhabitant: a hermit named Haggopya (accent on the 
"ya") who lives in a well-fortified house on the surface by the entrance 
to the underground regions. He's friendly, though aloof, and speaks 
Tsolyani somewhat.  I think he is from western Salarvya or possibbly 
Tsolyanu, but he never talks about himself. Your players can get some 
advice from him -- but no secrets.

[Moderator's Note:  Due to a book-keeping error, this message (sent later)  ]
[                   was answered prior to the one above.                    ]

I am puzzled. The only ruins marked on the map in Pechano are the great 
Ssu city of Ssuganar. I never put Ssurayal on it, although it rightly 
does belong there because of its size and ancient strength. It was the 
headquarters of the human guards who were set to watch over the Ssu  
"reservation." After the end of the Latter Times the place was pretty 
much abandoned. There are still some surface ruins there, as well as 
a complex of mostly destroyed underground centres, including living 
quarters, weapons chambers, intelligence-gathering devices, and  even 
a spacecraft or two. Most of this was turned almost edgewise by a 
great earthquake at the end of the Latter Times, and those who take 
the tubeway car to the old station may find that they step out of 
their car (which has artificial gravity of its own) and try to walk 
over to the nearest entrance, 100 metres away across what looks like 
a flat floor -- only to plunge 100 metres straight down!

There isn't much left to find. It's been looted by the departing 
humans, by various warlords of the Latter Times, and by the Ssu, 
of course. The exit is difficult -- up through narrow crevices to 
the surface.
 
Ssuganar is much more difficult. No tubeway cars go there. It was 
the headquarters of the Ssu themselves before the Time of Darkness. 
It is still visited by parties of Ssu, and there is more danger than 
even a strong party can handle.

Just a note to say thanks for the details of your adventures in Tekumel
which you've been giving us via the Blue Room.  I know that I personally
would be happy to read as much as you care to give us!  Do you have any
special memories of your visit to the Island of Ganga?  

Thanks again,

[Moderator's Note:  Tom Robertson wants more information on Ditlana.         ]

The Emperors designated one or more cities as candidates for Ditlana, 
relying upon the priesthoods, omens, astrology, and religious symbolism. 
Once a city was chosen, its inhabitants were moved a block or so at a 
time from their homes to temporary lodgings, to other clanhouses, to 
relatives in other cities, etc., and the empty block was given the 
urban renewal treatment. Knock it down, flatten it, cover over holes, 
tunnels, and pits, and strengthen the new "ground-level" floor with 
masonry, then build new buildings atop this according to plans and needs 
submitted by the owners. Thus, for example, if the Red Sword clan decided 
to put up a new clanhouse in the empty space where the old one had stood, 
they prepared plans (at their own plus Imperial expense), hired masons 
and builders, and consulted with city planners to develop the best 
building possible. The great clans could do this since money from other 
places was available: all the cities of the land were never done at the 
same time!  Materials, transport, labour, all had to be pre-arranged. 
This is no easy task, not even for a society as rigidly controlled as 
Tsolyanu. The custom has now fallen behind schedule by many years, due to 
economic, political, and military pressures. The population has grown, 
and the country is too unstable to allow for the expenditure of the huge 
amounts of wealth, time, materials, and labour needed. As an example, 
Jakalla is now seriously overdue, but with the war in the north dragging 
on, and Prince Rereshqala digging into the treasury for funds for his 
army, it is unlikely that the priesthoods will be listened to for some 
time to come. Just before the current war, the Red clans of Tumissa 
(Red Sword, Red Sun, etc.) were considering uniting to "do" parts of old 
Tumissa, but these ideas are now on hold while the princes fight out the 
succession to the Petal Throne. It's likely that the powers that be will 
get back to Ditlana again, once a new Emperor has been chosen, and the 
old stability is restored.

Ditlana is still spoken of as an important social renewal, one that MUST 
be done from time to time in order to maintain the nation. A lot of 
conservatives are deeply concerned that this has not been possible in 
recent years. Everybody is waiting for Dhich'une to be ousted from 
Avanthar, and a new -- and proper -- Kolumejalim to be held; then you'll 
see the various city fathers headed off to Avanthar with plans and 
budgets and offers of clan support.

Regards, Phil

[                   other Tekumel projects.                                 ]

Last summer, we discussed putting together a "Newcomer's Guide to
Tsolyanu".  I volunteered to coordinate/edit this project, and I am now
ready to get started.  Professor Barker has agreed to look over our work
and help us gain the official Seal of Approval, and Ed Wimble of TOME is
guardedly enthusiastic about such a product, provided the professor okays
the final version.  All we have to do now is write it!

That's WE.  I can't do it alone.  I am looking for reliable volunteers to
write chapters of the book.  I am aiming for a cross between the old
Sourcebook and a Fodor's guide to Tsolyanu.  It will provide cultural and
background information for beginning players and referees, while
hopefully providing color and descriptions useful even to us experienced
folks.  Unlike a Fodors (or the Sourcebook), this book is going to also have
to serve as a useful reference book, which means excellent indexing, and
some effort to keep related material together.  This book will replace
many of the functions of the old sourcebook, and we can borrow liberally
from that.  I want a different focus for this work than a simple up date of
the sourcebook.  Furthermore, I want it all in one volume, which is why I
am going to limit it to Tsolyanu alone.

I want to model this book on the Book of Ebon Bindings, in that it will take
itself seriously as having been either written by Tsolyani contacts and
translated into English, or by those of us from this world who have
travelled to Tsolyanu.  Similarly, this book will have no rules or game
specific information.

I want each chapter to feature Tsolyani voices.  The chapter doesn't have
to be written by a Tsolyani, but each author should cultivate one or more
Tsolyani personae to add color and flavor to the book.  This book should
include voices from many walks of life, and not be limited to priests of
Ksarul and Thumis! 

Most importantly, this book is going to be a recruitment tool for new
players.  We want stuff that will draw people into the world.  For me, the
biggest thrill the original sourcebook was that it filled me with the
desire to see places like The Plain of Towers, Ssuganar, the Shaft Which
Transfixes the World, or the labyrinth near the city of Tkekmar.  I want
this book to make readers want to taste the fine cooking of the House of
Five Pillars in Mrelu, to sample the pleasures of the Portico of Ebullient
Delights in Tsatsayagga, or to study the items in the curio cabinets of
Lord Tekunu, just to name a few examples.  Every chapter should have
hooks in it to make newcomers say "Cool!  I want to check that out!"

If possible, it would be nice if the book also contained some adventure
hooks.  Dragon Magazine's reviewer always complains when sourcebooks
don't provide beginning GMs with adventure ideas.  On the other hand, our
book is NOT going to be a description of NPCs, locations, and maps.  If we
can give referees ideas with our book, great.  If we can't, don't worry too
much about it.

I have a proposed list of things we'll need to cover from our summer
discussion (special thanks to Paul Snow and Alex Stojanovic for their
submissions).  There's going to be some overlap with the other books, even
the ones that are currently available, but I insist that this book not be 
full of "refer to Adventures on Tekumel, Part One to find out about ...".
This list can be reorganized and changed.

1. Some basic facts about Tekumel.  A lot of this has been done overtime
and again, but to be complete, our book should have it too.  I'd like to
include the following topics:

A. A quick review of Tsolyanu: geography, temperature, major products,
the big cities, the Sakbe roads.

B. Common animals and plants everybody would know about: Chlen, Hma,
Hmelu, Kaika, cats, dogs, Renyu, Kuni, Kheschal-birds, dna-grain, yafa-
rice, the lack of riding animals, etc.  We don't need every creature in the
Bestiary.

C. Basic history.  This should quickly sketch over the empires of Llyan of
Tsamra, the Dragon Warriors, The Three States of the Triangle, the
Fisherman Kings, the First Imperium, the Engsvanyali empire, the Five
Empires.  A quick sketch of Tsolyani history--mention some of the more
well-known emperors, an interregnum or two, etc.  The idea is to provide
enough information for players to figure out what their upper-class
Tsolyani characters would know.

D. Languages.  A very brief section.  Explain how the languages of the Five
Empires are all descended from the Engsvanyali; a word about secret
argots, other language families.  Some useful bits, like how Engsvanyali is
often used in official greetings, long-winded praises to the Emperor open
all official business, noble-ignoble nouns instead of masculine-feminine,
the 26 forms of you, attitudinal prefixes, the fact that some temples
have their holy books in different languages.  The idea here is to give
beginning players reasons to study some of those esoteric languages
listed in AoT, Part One.

2. Social customs, including clothing and nudity, meshqu, sex, Aridani
status, etc.  Travellers to a new country have to know what to wear, that
there is no such thing as a "nondescript costume", who they can sleep
with, and so on.  It is also going to be important to understand the dual
statuses for women.  This chapter can flow into a typical clanhouse
life, below.

3. Clans and status.  Building blocks of society, common mythological
roots for clans, lineage, the hierarchy of loyalty (friends, family, lineage,
clan, temple, nation), and typical clanhouse life.  [Note: AoT Part One has
some of this.]  One way to do this might be to write it as though a Tsolyani
were bringing somebody into the clanhouse.  It is crucial that players
understand the different treatments one may expect as a citizen, a
civilized foreigner, and a barbarian.  Players also need to know things like
getting letters of credit, favors they can ask of their clan,
responsibilities toward the clan, living arrangements, etc.

4. Political institutions.  The four palaces, the political chain of command
from the village headmen up to the Emperor, the Tlakotani clan and the
Kolumejalim, the political power of the great clans and the military,
royalist, priestly, and imperial parties, the perennially restive Ito and
Vriddi clans, etc.  This chapter should help players understand who to go
to for political help, which bureaucracy to get travelling papers from, how
to pay taxes, what high posts they might reasonably petition to obtain,
etc.  Tekumel works hard at having players involved in society, unlike
most role playing games--this is where we hammer the point home.

5. The law.  The Concordat, slavery, arming slaves, shamtla and other
punishments, the Manifesto of Noble Deliverance, assassins, tomb robbing,
and the actual amount of crime around.  A list of some of the more
notorious prisons around the Empire would be educational.  Players should
understand what to expect from the law, what is illegal, what penalties to
expect, how to file a lawsuit and how to defend oneself from one,
responsibilities when hiring people for dangerous adventures, and so forth.

6. The noble professions.  A quick gloss on the career paths for most
players.

A. The military.  A quick word about how the legions have histories and
reputations, likes and dislikes.  Perhaps a word about how the Sakbe road
guards, temple guards, and tomb police figure into the military system. 
Maybe a quick piece on Tsolyani warfare.  Most of this information is
found in AoT Part Two, Vol. One, so we only need a light gloss on this
material.

B. The priesthood.  Also covered in AoT Part Two, Vol. One.  A fast
discussion of the various types of priests (ritual, scholar, sorcerer,
administrative).  Maybe some words about their duties, and how they are
not free to simply travel from town to town and go on adventures.

C. The bureaucracy.  Neglected in AoT, so we should cover it.  Circles, how
to get promoted, the various organizations to belong to and the Tsolyani
love for visual representation of status with their daises and scribes. 
Players may not want to be bureaucrats, but they're going to want to know
how to manipulate them.  A word or two about how inducements are a
major source of income, and that it costs money to keep up appropriate
appearances for high status jobs.

D. Merchants.  Most of AoT Part Two, Vol. Two covers merchant adventures. 
We'll need to talk about clan involvement, how one arranges a caravan,
sailing vs. walking, the sorts of goods one may deal with, what to expect
when crossing a border, what happens during war, smuggling, paying
duties, and so forth.

7. Religion.  Covered to some degree in AoT, Part One, and Part Two, Vol.
One.  In addition to a quick review of the gods and cohorts, and a whisper
or two of the Pariah Gods, players who read this chapter should
understand they will primarily belong to one faith, but can visit other
temples (of the same general alignment).  Players should know about
Aspects and have a list of some of the more important ones, know how and
when to make sacrifices, know about ecclesiastical courts, the role of
temples in Tsolyani society, etc.  We will scrupulously avoid competing
with Bob Alberti's work in progress on the gods, so we'll keep this basic
and focus more on the average citizen's view of religion.

8. Magic.  People should know the basics of magic (the Planes Beyond,
"reaching through", the fact that metal disrupts spells, the technology of
the Ancients compared to modern magic), and also the less precise
knowledge of the average Tsolyani citizen.  Players should know about
bazaar sorcerers, whose powers are suspect at best, the superstition of
the Tsolyani, the difference between sorcerer priests and laypriests, the
role of magical bodyguards.  While we're at it, a section on common pieces
of ancient technology would be nice: lightning bringers, aircars, Eyes,
Ru'un, etc.  I would prefer that this chapter emphasize the "real Tekumel"
rather than the magically rich game Tekumel.

9. The calender.  The writer will need access to the Zocchi edition of the
sourcebook to have the original calendar information.  Creative persons
will have to list all of the national holidays, the major holidays in all of
the cities, and possibly all of the minor festivals in one city, such as
Jakalla or Bey Su.  Descriptions of some of the festivities would be nice. 
Again, we complement Bob Alberti's book, not overlap it.

10. Common non-humans, where they live in the Empire, what you can
expect when you meet them.  Covered to some degree in the Bestiary and
the Archetypes.



Reliable volunteers should email me, Bob Dushay (rdushay@delphi.com) and
tell me which chapter or part of a chapter you'd like to write.  You don't
have to be a Tekumel expert--I don't think there are more than five people
on earth who feel they are Tekumel experts.  Newbies are very welcome to
write!  At the very least, you can take the appropriate section(s) of the
sourcebook and rewrite it to fit my new format, and add some color.  Even
small contributions may be useful.  If there's information you think this
book should have, and I haven't included it in the outline above, let me
know.

If you are one of the voices complaining about the lousy job TOME has been
doing, or that the game is dying for lack of interest, here is your best
chance to do something useful.  This is perhaps our last, best chance to
bring Tekumel into the role playing world's consciousness.  Let's hear from
you.


Technical stuff.  I work on a Mac System, and would prefer submissions to
be Mac MS Word 5.1 format, with accents in place.  If you have a PC or 
other system, you can easily submit files as ASCII, using the standard 
Blueroom accent code system."   

[Moderator's Note:  A copy of that system is available by sending me email.  ]
