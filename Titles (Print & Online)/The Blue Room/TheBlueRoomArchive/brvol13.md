These messages are the accumulation of the messages that were sent out on 
the Blue Room email list between May 1995 and June 2000.  A large portion 
of the information is directly from Professor M.A.R Barker. When the list 
members joined during the time the list was active, they agreed to refrain 
from sharing this data with non list members.  When the list ended, it was 
urged that the data be made available to non-list Tekumel fans, and it 
seemed like a good idea all around.

I only ask that if you download these digests, or have received them in 
some other way, please respect the agreements the list members made, and 
refrain from passing them around and instead point people to the Tekumel 
web site, www.tekumel.com so that they can download them for themselves, 
and see all the other material available on the Tekumel.com web site.

Many Thanks.

Campaign Log Zero
-----------------

On request, I am sending my campaign summaries to the blueroom list.  
This first message is "set-up" information necessary for understanding 
the logs.


About the Summaries
-------------------

Each summary is titled and dated.  They are logs of what happened, 
not diaries, and as such they are not written from any one point 
of view, though since I am the author of the logs, my character 
tends to take center stage more often than others.

They are "joke logs," so read them with a large grain of salt.  
(perhaps it is best to drive to a salt mine first).  I added 
editorial remarks in a few places for clarification for those 
not present (i.e. almost all the blueroom members).  All editorial 
remarks not part of the original logs are in brackets [].  

For those who don't know this already, "^H" is the backspace symbol.  
A string of N ^H means that you're supposed to "erase" the previous 
N characters.  I used them on average at least once a summary.
The reason will become clear when you see them.


On the Campaign
---------------

Joe has set his campaign in the same year that Dhich'une took the
Petal Throne.  All the characters comes from very high status
clans (you'll meet them soon), and the campaign will be heavy
on the politics.  One of the tricky elements is the very different
loyalties that the characters have, and I'm looking forward to how 
this plays out in the campaign.  Joe did disallow Sarku worshipping 
characters, and a good thing too.  I think a Sarku worshipping 
character would have found him- or herself quite unrevivably dead 
rather early on in the campaign.  (Then again, they might *like* that.)


On Magic in the Campaign
------------------------

We have two sorcerers in the campaign, so we use quite a bit of 
magic (as do our foes too!  :-(  ).  We're careful about how much 
metal the sorcerers are carrying, what spells they can learn from 
their temples, and what the spells cost in spell points, but we've 
been lax about durations and casting time and rather loose in the 
interpretation of what one can do with illusion-type spells.


Meet the Cast
-------------

Shekkara Tlakotani 

	More beautiful than even Princess Ma'in (but don't say that
	publicly!), this clan niece of Prince Rereshqala is a 23 year
	old fourth-circle Priestess of Dlamelish (much to Hnalla-
	worshipping Rereshqala's chagrin).  Born and raised in Jakalla, 
	she is Jakallani through and through, which means that she's 
	doubly arrogant and will happily eat food so spicy hot that it 
	takes the skin off of other mortals' lips.  Good clan girl?  
	You must be joking.

	The woman who has it all, including perhaps too much fondness for 
	Liviyani men, is learning how difficult it is to hang on to it.

	[maxed the comeliness roll]


Tetkoru hiSsaynuch of the Golden Sunburst

	Handsome, yes; urbane, no.  This 19 year old enthusiastic 
	(though moderate) worshipper of Vimuhla and Kasi in the 
	Legion of Storm of Fire comes from a part of Tsolyanu so
	rural that Chlen races are considered major entertainment.
	This hasn't hindered his career, though, as evinced by
	his quick rise to Kasi (his family bought him the rank of
	Tirrikamu; he earned the rest) and recent personal favor 
	from Prince Mirusiya who awarded him the Gold of Glory.

	Jakalla's decandent and polished society shocked Tetkoru,
	but Tetkoru also shocked Jakalla with his unique blend
	of bravura, noble action, and ability to escalate the
	smallest matters worth perhaps 50 kaitars of Shamtla to
	20,000 kaitars and a duel so publicly known that Jakalla's 
	Hirlakte arena--normally closed during the heat of summer--
	was opened just to showcase it!


Akhan hiKetkolel of the Might of Ganga 

	Urbane, yes; handsome, no. (on the very homely side of average)
	This immensely strong 23 year old worshipper of Karakan and 
	Tirrikamu in the Legion of Ever Present Glory hails from 
	Tumissa.  His extraordinary strength made him popular among 
	the ladies of Dlamelish and Hrihiyal at Shekkara's latest 
	party.  He has a high regard for his own opinions, but his 
	bravery and loyality to his Prince and his friends is unmatched.

	Akhan has found himself "trapped" into helping Shekkara
	carry out what essentially amounts to a direct order coming 
	from Prince Rereshqala, and now he is wondering how in the 
	world he is going to get back to Paya Gupa and his legion 
	and the Prince he serves (and a long overdue promotion,
	but that's beside the point).

	[maxed strength]


Ngaya hiChaishyani of the Golden Bough 

	From the very heart of Empire, Avanthar, comes this fourth-
	circle Priestess of Chegarra.  Friendly and very honorable,
	Ngaya has an interest in politics which has recently become
	more than satisfied when she too became caught up with Shekkara's
	"family problems."  Ngaya takes turns pouting with the others
	whenever Shekkara chooses someone else to warm her bed, and
	seems to be the only one who doesn't know that her steel sword 
	is possessed by a demon.  She would be quite pretty if only
	she wore her hair differently, or perhaps it's the cut of her
	clothes, or her makeup...

	What could be more pleasant than a trip to Jakalla in the 
	heat of summer?  A return trip to Penom by sea!

	[Ngaya experienced the AoT Penom adventure, and wishes very 
	much that her player had chosen to take her elsewhere.]


Dlarku hiSsanmirin of the Cloak of Azure Gems

	Who knows for sure what this 28 year old reclusive fourth-
	circle Priest of Ksarul really looks like underneath his 
	silver mask?  Does it matter?  Who are you?  And why do you 
	want to know anything about him in the first place?

	Dlarku is learning how to share his body with an aspect of
	his god.  Everyone else fears that he is beginning to enjoy
	it a bit too much...


Mikusa hiNashomai of the Jade Diadem

	This 25 year old worshipper of Dlamelish and master 
	merchant--yes, she enjoys spending her time turning kaitars 
	into even more kaitars--has recently gotten caught up in 
	Shekkara's dirty family politics.  She is only just beginning 
	to realize just how far off the "neutral path" she has strayed.

	Mikusa has a liking for odd-foreign-ish things that must 
	certainly hurt her marriage prospects, but she's too busy 
	making money with her caravans to have time for marriage anyway.

	[maxed dexterity]
	[Mikusa makes her first appearance in the 7th log]


Their Most Secret Companion

	You expect me to enlighten you about her?  What's the point 
	of having a secret if you tell it to everyone?

	[NPC]
	


The Summaries:
--------------

I didn't start doing these session summaries until about the seventh
gaming session into the campaign.  Here's a one-paragraph description
of what had gone before.

Most of the characters met each other at least briefly at a party
that Shekkara threw in Jakalla.  Afterwards, they managed to get
invited (or invite themselves) to go to Lord Tekunu's fief--Jakalla
was becoming a bit too worm-infested for some tastes.  Little did
they know just what they were getting into... (Joe based the campaign's 
opening group adventure on the solo AoT archeology adventure.)  They 
returned to Jakalla afterward, where immediately upon their arrival 
Tetkoru got himself involved in "The Duel" (mentioned in passing in 
his character description). Very very soon afterwards, they were 
"recruited" by Prince Rereshqala to do a task for him: escort this 
anonymous woman out of Jakalla; she knows where she is going.  They 
were just setting out at the beginning of the first summary...

P.S.  yes, I know there aren't any horses in Tsolyanu.  The reference
      will be explained at the end of Log 1.

Joke log #1


Tell My Horse*
-------------
April 25, 1996, Session Summary:

[*"horse" is explained at the end of the summary]
 
When last we met our foolhardy^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hbrave, noble 
Tsolyani, they had left the winemakers' clanhouse just as it burst 
into flames.  

Under partial disguise, courtesy of a spell from The Most Beautiful 
Lady Shekkara, they made their way through the city toward the 
Temple district.  There, they encountered the first of two blockades.  
The Refulgent Lord Dlarku bluffs them past the first blockade--
that of the "enemy"--and at the second they find soldiers of an 
unknown legion keeping guard.  Lady Shekkara recognized them as 
those of Prince Rereshqala and showed to them the letter from her 
clan uncle, The Protector of Jakalla and Most Noble Imperial Prince 
Rereshqala.

[I make up various "titles" as the whim takes me.  Don't take them
seriously.  Rereshqala was taking the city; the "enemies" were those 
loyal to Emperor Dhich'une and anyone else who got in their way.]

Lord Dlarku then confidently led the party into the Temple of Ksarul 
and down into its lower and less used public chapels where The Most
Victorious Lord Tetkoru gifted a 9th circle Priest of the Doomed Prince 
for their gracious hospitality, while The Honorable Lady Ngaya 
displayed uncharacteristic clumsiness with her kaitars.

[Gifted?  Can we say "bribed to leave us alone?" I thought so.
Ngaya threw a kaitar at the priests after they had departed
down the corridor.  Fortunately, they didn't notice.]

Their Most Secret Companion directed them to a specific chapel.
There, they searched for and failed to locate, due to references
too obscure for those not of the Doomed Prince's faith, a door
that would lead them out and beyond the Temple, beyond the city,
beyond the reach of all but their enemies...  Ah, but I get ahead
of myself.

[the wall was covered in carved script in the secret language of
the priests of Ksarul, which Dlarku could read.  "references too
obscure..."  We like to think of it as a brief attack of blind 
stupidity as Dlarku's player's brain went on hold.]

Lord Dlarku requested some time alone with his God, and returned
to the group most transcendent* and requested the use of a sword.
Lord Tetkoru offered him the use of his magnificent metal blade,
which Lord Dlarku showed his appreciation of through expert handling.
Lady Shekkara and Lord Akhan observed most astutely Lord Dlarku's 
new state of mind, while Lord Dlarku revealed to the party that 
the secret of the door to Beyond can be had--for a price of a 
simple sacrifice.

[*Dlarku did "something" in that shrine and got himself "possessed" 
by a particularly violent aspect of Ksarul that Joe invented on the 
spot.  Dlarku barely knows which end of a sword to hold.  This aspect, 
however, handles swords just fine...]

Lady Shekkara's pleasure slave Arjun fainted.  Lady Ngaya, in the 
sharing spirit of Lord Chegarra, offered most generously the use of 
her slave as a sacrifice to Lord Ksarul, but, having recently become 
disassociated from consciousness, the slave sadly could not be used. (1)
The Mighty Lord Akhan then stepped in and offered his slave as a 
substitute.  The slave, in an act that reflects most nobly upon 
Akhan and his god Lord Karakan, went humbly to his fate.  As Lord 
Dlarku prepared the sacrifice, two first circle priests arrived just 
in time to participate in the ritual.  Having seem them and judged 
them to be more worthy than a mere slave for this great honor, the 
horse (2) , Lord Dlarku, sacrificed and feasted upon them instead.

[ 1 this Aspect enjoys a conscious and screaming sacrifice, but we
    did not know this and, in an attempt to make this go faster, Ngaya 
    had Akhan slug her slave into unconsciousness (it only takes one 
    slug well placed from Akhan) BTW, Dlarku had no slaves with him, 
    which is why the debate over who would donate a slave to "the cause" 
    happened.  Of course, all this fuss with the slaves was nothing 
    compared to the fuss that the first circle priests put up when 
    they realized just what their function was to be.
  2 again, I explain "horse" at the end of this summary]

Whereupon, after the feast, Lord Dlarku found himself alone in 
his corporal body, but not without the gift of knowledge from
his god:  The Door to Beyond may be opened by pressing upon the
single occurance of the word "door."

[Doh!]

Lord Dlarku, in a moment of unparalleled brilliance, recognized
that where they were going it would be better for them to travel 
in the accompanied with his god than without, and so wisely 
dispensed with performing the ritual of cleansing.

[Dlarku, a 4th circle priest, did not know the cleansing ritual!
In fact, he should have never become possessed at all.  La!  We 
cannot begin to count the number of temple rules broken this night.]

The most brave and noble party quickly departed for places low.
Yea!  One might even say that they venture into the depths of the
Underworld!  La!  So brave is our party!  So noble must be their 
goal to venture to such a despised place where ignoble acts are 
perpetrated against noble persons without recourse!  May their
foes quake with laughter^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hfear at the sound of
their footsteps!

Lo!  Wrote this, Lisa Leutheuser, horse* of The Most Beautiful
Shekkara Tlakotani, on this 30th day of April, 1996 Anno Domini.

Next session:  "off the wall, off the record"

[*This is a Voodoo term for possession, and a joke on the Professor's 
own convention of calling the characters "vehicles" for the players.  
In Voodoo, the person who is possessed by a loa ("god") is called 
the "horse," that is, they are the "vehicle" through which the loa 
will speak and act.  So here I have reversed the Professor's 
description and have the players being vehicles for the characters,
who come down and "possess" the players one night a week.

And, obviously, Lord Dlarku has become the "horse" for the aspect of 
Ksarul that (still!) shares his body.]

[Moderator's Note:  Fred Kiesche reflects on maps and other differences ]
[                   between roleplaying on Tekumel and elsewhere.       ]

//363

Greetings:

The recent discussion about maps reminds me of trying with EPT to make
Tekumel seem like something other than another D&D variant. We had one
situation where the players had escaped from the Underworld. They were 
on the surface, hidden amongst some monuments to glories past, trying 
to figure out how to get back to Jakalla. It was night. 

They planned, and they planned, without me saying much. They had 
astronomy skills, they figured they'd navigate by the stars in the 
general direction of Jakalla and at least get somewhat back.

"There are no stars", I stated.

"But! But! But! There are stars--you said it was a clear night!" they
replied.

I reminded them of the history that I had gone over before we played,
trans-dimensional tunnels, planets getting sucked in--only one star 
in the neighborhood.

Well, they determined that they should be able to navigate by the moons, 
and I agreed. But it was a good lesson in where they were--not on a 
alter-Earth, but a truley alien place.

I used to suggest that they read stuff by Jack Vance--like the Tschai
novels--to get a feel for humans in a alien place. It seemed to work.

I saw some of these Arab trade maps when I was last in Oman.  Although 
they are not cartography as we would recognise it, they were perfectly 
adequate for the type of travel they undertook.  The real problem for 
a Tsolyani using such a thing would come if they stepped off the route.  
Being more by way of a route plan than a 'map' they do not encourage 
exploration of the land to each side.  Curiously this is probably an 
advantage in a strict society like Tsolyanu.

Hi,

As a GM new to Tekumel, I wondered if people on the mailing list could come
up with some suitable ideas for adventures, or even fully worked out scenarios.
Both the players and I are new to this setting, so introductory material is what
I'm after.  Also the players are mostly familiar with the AD&D style of play, so
Underworld type adventures would probably appleal to them most, though I want
them to be able to savour the unique colour and depth of Tekumel as well.

Thanks in anticipation,

There really isn't a lot known about Girigamish. At this great time-depth, 
it isn't even very likely that such a person can be placed for certain. 
The end of the Latter Times was not just one event that happened at one, 
fixed, historical time; it seems to have ended sooner here and lingered 
longer there. The Tsolyani think the Latter times ended some time later 
than do the Liyani, who claim that there were still active scholars, 
cities, etc. surviving into a somewhat later era, particularly down in 
the Southern Continent to the southwest of Livyanu (what they now term 
the "Naqsai Lands").

EPT is correct as far as legend goes: the Bednalljan period is a sort 
of catch-all for legends, myths, heroes, and all sorts of unprovable 
stuff. If you don't have accurate dates or archaeological evidence, 
you just toss it into the Bednalljan Dynasty and hope you're right. 
New research reveals that some of these legends are older than popular 
belief had previously placed them. Current thinking places several of 
these legendary wizards, heroes, and Wunderkind back in the shadowy 
centuries near the end of the Latter Times. Certainly the origins of 
many of the technological (or techno/sorcerous) devices now listed as 
having been invented during such and such a dynasty are dubious at best. 
The Hra, the Ru'un, and others of these advanced creations are vey 
likely to come from farther back in history than the modern priesthoods 
are willing to admit.

As for the number of devices Girigamish made, this is again part of the 
legend. EPT recounts the common story told in the Temple of Ksarul. In 
Gardasiyal, I was more conservative and listed only the one certain 
device attested by the Priesthood. Girigamish almost certainly made more 
than one -- and perhaps other devices as well -- but only this one can 
actually be proved to exist by historical records. You'll find a treatise 
on it in the Phantasmic Library of the Indigo Tower in the city of 
Hmakuyal. Don't expect to check it out for a quick read, however; it's in 
one of the treasuries of the Temple of Ksarul there and hasn't been allowed 
out for millennia.

Regards,

Phil

Off the Wall, Off the Record
----------------------------
May 2 1996 Session Summary:


After session "quote of the week" is by Ngaya:  "When I loaned 
him my sword, I didn't know he was going to start at the feet!"

-----


We last left our rash Tsolyani standing on the dark, foreboding edge of 
the Jakallani Underworld.

After displaying great feats of agility, the party courteously announced 
their presence with loud shouts and foot stomping to those worshiping at 
a secluded Ksarul shrine below them.

Lord Dlarku greeted his fellow priest and priestess, honoring them with 
a glimpse of his real face.  The priestess was so overcome with emotion 
at meeting Dlarku that she immediately summoned a Nexus Point to carry 
him away from the dark, dreary place of Jakalla's underworld.  Alas, 
Lord Tetkoru got in the way, and the Nexus point swallowed him and his 
fire-bearing slave instead, leaving poor Dlarku behind.

[Tetkoru's player, Alex, is spending the summer in New Orleans.
 More fool him.

 I did not mention this previously, but Dlarku was wanted for the murder
 of a fellow Ksarul priest from an adventure that pre-dates these logs.  
 He was actually framed for the murder, but he didn't stick around to try
 and clear up the misunderstanding.  (which does not help him look at all 
 innocent)  The players are guessing the above priestess wanted to capture 
 him for those charges.  Of course, these are all unwarranted assumptions 
 based on observed surface actions.  Suffice to say there is strange
 secret society stuff going on.]
 
Angry at their clumsy mistake and at being left behind, Dlarku cast 
a bright flash of light as a symbol of his desire to open hostilities.
The priest responded in kind, symbolizing his acceptance and willingness 
to engage in a battle of magical energies [1].  Lady Shekkara, 4th 
circle Priestess of Dlamelish, cast doubt concerning her true faith 
when she displayed remarkable facility with a Ksarul temple spell [2].
Lord Akhan marveled at his expert knife throw that not only hit the 
priest, but put him instantly to sleep [3]. Their Most Secret Companion 
shed the Light of Hnalla upon the situation, enlightening all, while 
Dlarku dessicated his fingertips [4].

[1 that is, both of their spells fizzled, with only a showy display of 
   light for their efforts
 2 Shekkara imitated the effects of a successfully cast spell which was 
   not noted in this combat sequence
 3 Akhan threw a knife at the same time Shekkara cast a sleep spell
 4 another useless failed spell]

Lady Shekkara collected an Eye of Unknown Properties from the body
of the priestess from which life had departed forever.  When the 
Sleeping Prince of the Blueroom descended once again upon Dlarku, Lady 
Ngaya most generously loaned the use of her metal sword to him, and 
Dlarku once again demonstrated proper sacrifice technique for those 
who missed it the first time around.  Upon realizing that he had just 
sacrificed a most noble friend*, he then turned the blade upon himself.
Lord Akhan slugged Dlarku and took the sword away from him.

[*Dlarku actually knew the priest personally and thought he was an ally, 
 before the priest turned against him in this encounter.  Ngaya's sword, 
 by the way, is possessed by a stability-perferring demon that took 
 exception to being used by an Aspect of Ksarul, and tried to force Dlarku 
 to kill himself.  Ngaya is still convinced that there is nothing unusual 
 about her sword other than it's metal.  Then again, Ngaya has the psychic 
 sensitivity of an iron bar.]
 
Not wanting to mar the artistic death scene with the sight of living 
souls for those who, by the sound of their footsteps, would soon arrive,
the party then departed.

Much to everyone's happiness, Dlarku bathed himself in the overflow of 
the Equnoyel river.  Shekkara demonstrated Jakallani sword technique 
to a Scales of Brown mrur.  The party took a small detour to navigate 
one of the famous underworld mazes.

The party paused in the tomb of an ancient Engsvanyali merchant to
admire the Lament to the Whell of Black expertly carved upon the walls, 
and Akhan displayed his renyu's prowess at sniffing out Scales of 
Brown troops.  Then Ngaya demonstrated proper technique for triggering 
a poison gas trap and, in an amazing feat of agility and speed, topped 
that with a world record breaking sprint. 

[the party explored various passages, discovering (and setting off!)
traps, and, in the Renyu's case, sniffing out Scales of Brown troops
heading their way!  While from another direction comes a group of
tomb robbers...]

Shekkara showed to all her great persuassive abilities in earning the 
trust of a group of tomb robbers, giving to them, in a surprising 
display of generosity, a prized item of jewelry.

[a failed bribe attempt]

When the troops of the Legion of the Scales of Brown, those who would 
thwart our most noble heroes' purposes, came upon them, Akhan and Dlarku 
quickly showed the party which way to freedom not to take*.  Shekkara 
raised a wall to hide behind and block the troops' way, and the party 
eavesdropped on their nefarious plans to attack The Most Noble Prince 
Rereshqala.

[*ouch!  damn those poison spear traps!
Their plans were a surprise attack on Rereshqala's forces by sneaking 
up on them by taking a "short-cut" through the underworld.]

Finding themselves blocked by the unexpected wall, the troops instead 
pursued the ungracious tomb robbers, while our party made quick their 
exit.

But, of course, as this all happened in the underworld, who can say 
what truly transpired?


Lo!  Wrote this, Lisa Leutheuser, horse of The Most Beautiful
Shekkara Tlakotani, on this 6th day of May, 1996 Anno Domini.

Next week "between a wall and a sharp point", when imaginary Engsvanyali 
walls come falling down...

Subject: See Salarvya at 5 Nzuggesh a day!

I have been slowly moving my campaign into Eastern Salarvya.  (It is 
now the beginning of 2365.)  As this is relatively undetailed land, 
I have been forced to turn to other resources for information.  After 
plying a rogue named Nzutlmanshi Dhrengngommo with expensive Dronu, I 
was able to glean some details about the coastline from Tsatsayagga to 
the Ojjarga flats, in between stories about Nzutlmanshi's "heroics" in 
battling Haida Pakallani pirates.  Luckily, I checked with the professor, 
who kindly corrected the most obvious misinformation.  I present this 
material to you in case you need to travel to this region.  The 
professor's comments on my material are marked by a ">".  The wrong 
information I originally wrote has been removed.

I hesitate to call this official without further word from Minneapolis 
(I especially note here the professor's uncertainty regarding Fammannazhtl 
Island and the lighthouses of Peleis), but it may provide guidance for 
other travelers.  Oh, and if you meet Nzutlmanshi Dhrengngommo, tell him 
the OAL is looking for him.

--Bob Dushay

The towns of Ajjan and Muallu are typical Salarvyani coastal towns: 
the coast nearby is studded with enchanted steles to repel pirate 
attacks, the walls are in good repair, and the town within has 
narrow streets, elaborately decorated buildings, and a noticeable 
odor of human bodies, strong pomades, and baking raw sewage.  There 
is a frowning fortress where the ruling family resides, overlooking 
the walls, but a long arrow shot within.  Townsfolk bustle about on 
their business, and curious children follow travellers if they enter 
the town.  

Ajjan: The rulers of Ajjan are strongly tied to the Chruggilleshmu 
family of Tsatsayagga.  The dock facilities are good, because ships 
of the Nchesh of the Sea Grey Wave visit here frequently.  In fact, 
Ajjan provides good recruits for this Nchesh.  Papers from the 
Chruggilleshmu are usually respected.  On the other hand, travelers 
coming overland from Jeggeth may be scrutinized as possible agents 
from the Gurrushyugga.

>The name of the ruling family is Khelantikesh. I think...??? The 
>rest is correct. The local ruler is a reasonable fellow, but there 
>are factions at his court that want closer ties with Tsa'avtulgu 
>to the north, where the most unwholesome and repellent of all of 
>Sarku's Aspects rules: Black Qarqa.

Muallu: Muallu is a small town, ruled by the Hwa'altikonesh family, 
placed in power by the Chruggilleshmu to remove the Ruthoshshikh 
family, who ruled the independent Chadara before it was conquered as 
a protectorate.  Muallu is too small to figure into higher politics, 
and it does not suffer from the attentions of Tsa'avtulgu.  This 
freedom from outside meddling allows the Hwa'altikonesh family to 
keep a firm hand on the protectorate.  Political dissidents are 
swiftly suppressed, which helps to maintain Muallu's reputation as 
a sleepy backwater.  Prices are high, outsiders are not encouraged 
to stay after trading, and there is little to do for sailors or other 
travelers.  Most press on to Peleis or Ajjan as fast as possible.

Physically, the buildings tend to be light grey limestone with grey 
tile roofs made from the local clay.  The artisans are not as skilled 
as in Tsatsayagga (or Ajjan, for that matter), but they have labored 
to cover every available surface with carved vinery, faces, demons, 
and praises to Shiringgayi.

>informant did not get the names right -- or your informants have written
>them down incorrectly. Salarvyani does sound rather like a mouthful of
>mush, punctuated with splinters of broken glass...


The Ojjarga Flats: The Ojjarga Flats are famous for their shellfish.  
The Salarvyani relish the Shuggwa (accent on the u), a black, pulpy 
thing in a tubular shell, which they eat raw, accompanied by a fiery 
seaweed paste (beginners find it vile); and the Ghighannok (accent on 
the a), a disk-shaped, twelve-legged, creature in a hard shell that 
is baked over coals.  One may also mention sea vegetables, such as 
Jujjokhkh (accent on the o), a muddy-green globule of a rubbery 
consistency, or Ng'atlmoch (accent on the o), a flabby mass with 
crisp black bulbs throughout, or Hlinnghom (accent on the o), clusters 
of small pods with a salty taste that is usually fried.  The Haqel, 
detailed in the Tekumel Bestiary, is appreciated here as a fine eating 
fish, although it is very expensive due to the dangers of hunting it.  
When they grow large enough, they feed on the fisherman and destroy 
their boats, and occasional monster-sized ones threaten larger vessels.  
Such monsters usually require an expedition to hunt down and kill it. 
The Haqel are responsible for many deaths and lost limbs among the 
fishers.  A caution to foreigners: although these dishes are Salarvyani 
delicacies, it takes non-natives months to acclimatize to the cuisine.  
In addition to tasting vile to the uninitiated, vomiting and severe 
diarrhea are common side-effects for outlanders unacclimated to 
Salarvyani food.  Hlinnghom is especially vile, and none but the locals 
ever eat it.

Of the four towns on the Flats, Peleis is thought to have the best 
cuisine, both for its seafood and the agricultural bounties of the 
rich farmlands northwest of the city.  The markets are full of their 
fine black bread, multi-colored fruits, and rich, black Dronu.  
Foreigners find the land-food easier to digest than the seafood, and 
some of it is actually quite tasty.  Lollyanthi (accent on the a) stew, 
made from the gelatinous "bones" of a species of land-spider, is another 
local delicacy, but this is guaranteed to cause vomiting in an outlander 
(which is often quite amusing to the Peleisani.

>of black bread, thick soup made with the gelatinous "bones" of a species of
>land-spider, various fruits, and the inevitable black Dronu -- all of these
>are good and tasty.


Peleis: The town of Peleis is situated at the tip of a point, the main 
harbor facilities on the inside of the bay.  The famous Achetlappan 
lighthouse (accent on the last a) of Peleis and the Khaummodh (accent on 
the a) lighthouse of Fammannazhtl Island (accent on the middle a) allows 
pilots for hire to guide ships around the point without stopping at night.  

>I don't know the names of the lighthouses or of the points on which they
>stand. 

>There are minor probblems with your phonetics: Achetl(a)ppan requires a
>vowel of some sort after the "tl": I think it is "a". I am also unsure of

>denoting "...place." They may also be from western Salarvyani "-hlich,"
>which signifies "I think this is the correct word," which is suffixed to
>nouns used for the first time in a text.

Peleis has sturdy granite walls and magic-encrusted posts to keep pirates 
away, and often a warship or two from the Nchesh of the Sea Grey Wave in 
port, too.   There is a famous inn here, the Dhrummillyithetl House 
(umlaut over the u, accent on the final e), which has excellent Salarvyani 
seafood cooking (still very greasy for Tsolyani tastes) and Dronu, and good 
entertainment as well.  If one wishes to discover what the Salarvyani see 
in a greasy bowl of Lollyanthi stew, or a platter of baked Ghighannok 
drizzled with Hmelu fat, a side dish of fried Jujjokhkh, and a fine, thick 
black Dronu, this is the best place in the world to do it.  Sailors often 
throw their pay away here, and so many empty-pursed sailors have been 
thrown into the street that it is often called "the pauper's sleeping-mat".  

>The stew is the land-spider stew mentioned above. I had no idea this was 
>its name. I have never tried Ghighannok, and I wouldn't touch Hlinnghom 
>with a player-character's usual 10-foot pole!

This is one of the few places in Salarvya where a temple is dedicated 
exclusively to the Dlamelish aspect of Shiringgayi, and it has a steady 
supply of business, mostly from sailors.  In general, Peleisani are rather 
friendly, for Salarvyani, but hard bargainers.  They also expect to earn 
money for their hospitality.  The exception is that Peleisani hate and fear 
the Tsa'avtulguyani.  They will sometimes refer to Tsa'avtulgu as the 
"horrid city", avoiding even its mention.  They are glad that Shiggath and 
Naggas have been defending the lands north of the city for some years.

>Dlamelish is one of the "parts" of Shiringgayi, as you know. She is thus 
>tolerated in her "foreign" form as Dlamelish, although the Peleisi sneer
>at Tsolyani inability to see Her in Her Oneness.

>Your informant gave you a name [for the ruling family] which is 
>absolutely incorrect. It is part of the cultural tradition of Peleis that 
>one never names a person, clan, or ruling group that is higher than his/
>her own. One says only "Wowallyu khukh" which denotes something like "the

The name of the ruling family of Peleis is Wittupenuhk.  They are a canny 
family that values keeping Peleis pleasant (and profitable).  Travelers 
don't mind the high costs because of the virtues of the town.  The 
Wittupenuhk are grateful that Shiggath buffers them from the attentions of 
the Gurrushyugga, and owe their position and loyalties to the 
Chruggilleshmu.  Peleis is a good place to collect information and rumors 
without actually moving into non-Chruggilleshmu territory, although the 
information received is not always the most up to date nor the most 
accurate.

The large island just off Point Pu'ortlinggoch is called Fammannazhtl 
Island.  It supports the aforementioned Khaummodh lighthouse and Village 
P'dworma, where Hmelu are raised for their meat, and Gudru plants are 
raised to make cloth.  The lichens on the island provide fine dyes of ochre 
and rust, and are in some demand.  The villagers there are thought to be 
simple and suspicious of visitors, but they spend money freely enough when 
they sail in to Peleis.

>This is mostly correct, though I cannot vouch for the names of these
>places.


Shiggath: Shiggath is a strong contrast to the other towns of the Flats.  
Situated by the mouth of the Tsa'av river, it is the best way for sea-
shipped goods to get to and from Tsa'avtulgu.  The Tsa'av spills an 
unpleasantly yellow-colored mud into the Flats, and the waters near 
Shiggath are stained with it.  The ruler is Lord Chuggillishmayul 
Vringgamuluk , a fussy little man devoted to his creature comforts and the 
deference of his subjects.  He is obsequious to those he is inferior to, 
(notably powerful Chruggilleshmu and Gurrushyugga agents) and overbearing 
and demanding of those below him.  

>Did Tekunu give you his name? I can check in my notes. I do recall this 
>rather obsequious little fellow. Like a slimy hair-ball found under a
>rug, as one of my players put it.

The Vringgamuluk family is the dominant political force of the Ojjarga 
Flats, and they have been fighting a war with forces from Tsa'avtulgu for 
years.  The Tsa'avtulgu armies are better equipped, but indifferently led 
and poorer fighters.  The forces raised from Shiggath are small and also 
poorly led, but they are supplemented by troops from Naggas, and Lord 
Vringgamuluk has been hiring mercenaries, many of them Haida Pakalayani 
fleeing from the unrest in their own land.

The Vringgamuluk  citadel of black granite frowns over the town, and the 
black-hatted police force is known to be far more concerned with extracting 
Nzuggesh than in enforcing laws, save for periodic sweeps for "known 
criminals".  It is rumored that travelers disappear here, and most visitors 
prefer to sleep on their ships.  (The city has its share of Gurrushyugga 
spies, and those travelers that interest the Lords of Tsa'avtulgu may find 
themselves drugged and carried off.)  Although the town can hardly be 
considered a happy place, the citizens do bustle, and they seem fairly 
prosperous.  There is a lot of merchant traffic.  Shiggath buys luxury 
goods, and taxes all the trade of the Ojjarga flats that comes within 
reach.  The Vringgamuluk  also collect tribute from all of the other 
families that are subordinate to it.  There is money in Shiggath.

Naggas: The walls are well-maintained, with spells and warnings carved into 
them, along with the protective steles driven into the shore.  The governor 
is Lord Mmachutusu Hruchchittlantyal, and his palace rises high above the 
town, each side of it carved with a massive, frowning face, which is why it 
is called "The Palace of the Four Faces".  Local legend says that four 
brother wizards of the Fisherman Kings were merged into the tower by the 
demon Shibb'tlekhkharm, who was cheated of his payment for his services in 
creating the port.  The streets ascend from the port to the rise of the 
palace, and then descend down to the other side.  The rich folk live near 
the rise, and the poor live closer to the walls, and especially by the 
waterfront.  The foreigner's quarter is small and divided from the rest of 
the city by the Zurr river.

>He's given you another wrong name for the river: it is Zurr.

[My informant told me it was "Eshqottlikkm".]

>I have no idea what he was trying to do to your party, but I suspect the
>name is some local obscenity that would get them arrested or killed!

It may also be noted that Naggas is at the far end of the Chruggilleshmu 
family's influence, and although the ruling Hruchchittlantyal family owes 
their fealty to the Chruggilleshmu through the Vringgamuluk family of 
Shiggath, they are well aware they are at the edge of their sphere of 
influence, and that the Gurrushyugga Clan of Tsa'avtulgu has designs on 
their city.  They have committed their forces to the war against 
Tsa'avtulgu, but the war has been mostly stalemated for some years.

(One of my favorite EPT memories. When we first started running EPT, of
course we had none of the guidance or resources available now...in the
process of naming characters we were using fairly straightforward
Tolkien-esque fantasy names--hey, most of us played D&D! One of my friends
was stumped. "What should I call my character?" he cried. "Call yourself 
a taxi" was the wiseacre response of one of the other players. So, 
Sir Ataxi of Jakalla was born!)

Ten. Each has two Wards that must be disarmed or used first before the 
key will work. Yes, these have counterparts on other Planes, but nobody 
knows exactly how freeing him on one of those Planes would affect Tekumel 
Prime.  They cannot be intermixed or used on a Plane different from their 
Plane of origin.
 
>>2) What _really_ caused the earthquake that destroyed Ganga?
>The Prof has alluded to failure of the "Hero of the Age" of that era.

The Goddess won that round. When Kokun failed, down went Ganga.

>>3) Who is Prince Mridobu's Mother?  Is she alive?  From what clan, etc... A 
>>little description would be very useful.

Odd you should ask. She is Lady Mineleth hiBarudra of the Clan of the 
Cloak of Azure Gems. She's still alive -- or was last week. She has 
retired to the Temple of Ksarul at Hmakuyal and is said to be high 
in the Inner Hierarchy, although that may or may not be true since 
the Priesthood of the Doomed Prince rarely tells anything like it is. 
She is still beautiful, although she doesn't come out much or take 
part in secular affairs. She knew Hirkane before he was Emperor. It
is now 2,367. Hirkane acceded in 2,347, and Mridobu was born about 
2,325 -- when the Emperor was somewhere near 50 -- so she is probably 
50-60 now. Lady Kalusu hiViridame (mentioned in the Solitaire 
Adventures) knew Lady Mineleth fairly well and briefly served as her 
handmaiden, so this is likely to be as close to the facts as anyone 
is ever going to get.

>>4) Why didn't the Azure Legion use the Jade Arch on that archfiend 
>>Dhich'une? Or did they...

>I believe that the Jade Arch has gone a bit wonky, as we have heard here 
>recently.

There have been problems with the Jade Arch, due to unlawdul tinkering 
by Dhich'une's sorcerers and the priests of Sarku. Remember, too, that 
it was not designed to impose any particular ethical or religious ideas 
on the subject passing through it, but only an intense and unbreakable 
loyalty to the Petal Throne and the occupant thereof. Dhich'une could 
have waltzed through it singing' Dixie...

>>5) Which Legions are under Mridobu's command?  Current strengths and 
>>locations? A hint of his plans to unseat the False Kolumel? (oops, bias 
>>showing.)

>Well, Mridobu participated in a coup, that sat him on the throne for a mere
>2 days, before Dhich'une called up hordes of undead from below Avanthar and
>pitched everyone out.  Mridobu's body was never found, but some of us 
>believe that he has escaped.

Most of the Legions are now divided between those opting for Eselne and 
those working for the Taksuru-Mirusiya coalition. Rereshqala's Army of 
the South also is strong and getting stronger, with many of the Jakalla, 
Thraya, Jaikalor, Sokatis legions joining him. It's hard to say just 
which legions Mridobu could count on if he suddenly popped up again.

>>6) What is Mridobu's connection, if any, to the Cloak of Azure Gems?

The Clan of the Cloak of Azure Gems has only religious and aristoratic 
affiliations with the ruling Tlakotani clan. Naturally, the marriage 
between Lady Mineleth and Mridobu put them in line for goodies, if he 
managed to secure the Petal Throne. Looks unlikely now.

>>8) Had anyone ever been marked by the Seal?  What would happen to 
he that was so marked?

What do you mean "marked?" Nobody touches the Seal -- it's said to 
be kept in a thoroughly secure, secret place in the Golden Tower at 
Avanthar. Not even the Emperors ever take it out -- although Empress 
Dashiluna (1,279-1,306) is said to have demanded to see it. She was 
shown it, but one of her advisors argued her out of taking it out of 
its protected case and touching it. She ordered him to touch it 
instead, but he promptly begged the Servitors of Silence who were 
guarding it to kill him. They did so -- it is blasphemy to even 
breathe on it. This so infuriated the Empress that she made no 
further attempt to reach it and stalked out of the vault. That's the 
story, anyhow. I doubt whether even Dhich'une would dare break this 
tradition.

Phil

Lisa's Logs ought to become a net book! She writes cleverly and 
interestingly. I enjoy her stuff very much.

I probably added to my already-formulated idea of Tekumel's heat from 
my first experiences in India (Lucknow,etc.) in 1951-53. When I think 
of Tsolyanu, I get this picture of sweltering, steaming streets, swarms 
of bugs so numerous that the traffic cops could not stay at their traffic 
lights in the middle of the street -- the bugs formed a visible cloud 
around each light -- and the dripping, sweating, prickly-heat, the stuff 
rooms with little boys pulling sweep-fans, etc. etc. I loved every 
moment of it. As for tombs and catacombs, you should check out Lucknow.

Same originally happened in my first EPT campaigns. One player hired 
a Pe Choi warrior, whose name he had no hope of ever pronouncing. He 
gave the poor creature an enchanted steel sword to use in each hand, 
put him under haste, and had himself an unbeatable killing machine 
with four strikes per turn! He named this creation "Stuka."  I 
finally persuaded the player that nobody -- not even a Pe Choi -- 
could coordinate 4 sword blows at once, much less hit with enough 
force to do real damage. He was a rules-lawyer, however, and 
insisted. I finally just put my size 14 down and said rules or no 
rules, we weren't having any.

We also had a player who named his beautiful slave girl "Miss 
Clairol" because  of her long, glossy tresses. She ran off with him 
into the Chaigari Protectorate, but she may still be around somewhere, 
with her name now suitably Tekumelised. 

All of this is funny, but it does seem to detract from the "reality" 
of the world. I don't let players make "American jokes" within the 
game any more, although they are constantly quipping and sniping at 
each other outside the game context. This is just fine by me. It's 
part of the fun.

So, welcome to "Sir Ataxi." I assume that since Tsolyani doesn't have 
an "x" that is pronounced "ks" (as in English "taxi") that he spelled 
his name "Ataksi?"

Phil

I am thinking of developing a series of adventures in and around Ru.  I
intend to use the Battle of Ru for ideas, but wondered if anyone (the prof.
perhaps) could supply me with any details of the city, its inhabitants, clans,

Joke Log #3

Between a Wall and a Sharp Point
--------------------------------
May 7 1996 Session Summary

Our Tsolyani party decided to brave the sharp, poisoned traps of
their Engsvanyali ancestors as disposing of the Scales of Brown
sentries would be too easy.

Lord Akhan boldly volunteered to trigger each trap so that the
others might pass safely down the corridor.  Lady Shekkara checked
Lord Dlarku for concealed weapons while he checked her pain tolerance [1]
and Akhan's renyu discovered that sometimes having a tail is bad [2].

[ 1 a bit of mutual groping while passing each other
  2 the renyu got poison on his tail, then on rest of him, and on Akhan,
    on the walls, on the slaves...]

After the third trap, Dlarku became impatient with the party's
lazy progress and levitated himself to the end of the corridor.
Once there, he amused himself by performing a materials stress
test on the stone floor.

[partially collasped already, the floor promptly gave out beneath 
 our bright Refulgent Dlarku when he sat on the edge of a hole.  
 Lucky for him that he still had his levitation/flying spell on him.]

The Scales of Brown soldiers returned from hunting tomb robbers,
only to discover that their "map" was correct after all.*
Brave soldiers were ordered^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hvolunteered 
to explore the corridors where they were speared by the poisoned 
trick spears (we shall mourn!), but their noble deaths were not 
in vain as they later permitted our party to escape down the 
hallway, away from the soldiers, away from the sacrificial screams 
of the captured tomb robbers, away from--ah, but I get ahead of myself!

[* i.e. Shekkara's spell for the imaginary wall had expired
   Not mentioned:  the commanding officer got fed up with the loosing 
   good soldiers to the traps and called for a worship, meal, and 
   sleep break for his soldiers...]  

Our party settled down to a cozy dinner in the shade of the poison
spears, listening in silent appreciation as the Scales of Brown
soldiers began to serenade their god with the Songs of Sarku [1].
When the soldiers began to sacrifice their captives [2] to Lord Sarku, 
the party decided that it was time to leave lest the near presence 
of unbelievers cause distress to the soldiers, those Most Faithful 
to Sarku.

[ 1 written by by the Bey Su Rollers, of course!
  2 we're guessing they caught at least some of the tomb robbers
    see Joke Log #2]

Akhan and Dlarku had an eye-opening experience when Shekkara used the 
Eye of Most Brilliant Refulgency [1].  May the images they perceived
in this most transcendent moment be etched forever in their eyes!
Lady Ngaya sheltered the now-opened Eye from the harsh realities of
their dismal surroundings, allowing it only small glimpses of what
lay beyond her hands, while Shekkara most nimbly fetched the generous
gifts [2] from their benefactors, the Scales of Brown.

[ 1 *don't know the real name of the Eye; but it's as bright as a 
    giant spotlight of the kind they mount on police helicopters.
  2 the dead bodies]

Using the dead Scales of Brown soldiers to trigger the other traps,
the party then quickly took their leave to the end of the hall where
Dlarku and the Pit to Dark Unknown Depths awaited them.

In a show of foolhardiness^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hbravery, Akhan
leapt into the pit where he quickly made friends with the local
inhabitants.*  The rest quickly followed him, leaving behind the 
singing Sarku worshippers and their ecstatically wailing sacrificial 
victims and entering the underworld of the Bedjnallan era.  May they 
make their way safely and quickly and may they not meet the spirit of 
She Whose Thighs are Silken!

[* Dlaqo beetles.  The largest were easily the size of a VW Beetle.]

Lo!  Wrote this, Lisa Leutheuser, horse of The Most Beautiful
Shekkara Tlakotani, on this 14th day of May, 1996 Anno Domini.


Next Session: "for every two steps gained..."


P.S.  Those spear traps were nasty.  We spent a long time testing each 
      stone, finding out how many poison spears were set for each trap, 
      where they came from, what angle, and so on, so that one of us 
      could find the a safe place to put some weight to trigger the dang 
      things while the rest squeezed, climbed, and crawled their way 
      through.  We were about halfway down the hallway when the Scales 
      of Brown troops started exploring the same passage way.  Many thanks 
      to the powers that be that their torches did not burn brightly 
      enough to allow them to see us, and many more thanks that they got 
      fed up and retreated to the larger hallway to take a break, and the 
      largest thanks of all that Akhan's renyu did not sneeze.

      This was a very tense session.  Joe did a wonderful job with the
      atmosphere.  Our characters were edgy, tired, and scared.  A 
      number of us experienced the joyous sensations of the Engsvanyali
      poison on our bodies.  As you might guess, poison alliviation spells 
      were exceedingly useful during this time.

I would like to learn more about the Yeleth and Ru'un - specifically how
they have interacted with PC's in Professor Barker's campaigns
throughout the years. The accounts of listmembers who participated in
these encounters would be greatly appreciated, along with the input of
other DM's on this subject. I am also curious to know if anyone has ever
discovered any other forms of AI (artificial intelligence) in the
Professor's games.

I would also like interested parties to comment on the possibility that
the Lords of the Latter Times could have been capable of programming
AI's with variations of the "gestalts" used by human mages to cast
spells. (Professor Barker often compares the mental pattern of a spell
to a circuit board.) The other-planar powersources of these AI's might
be used to power these spells. Furthermore, an AI might have a great
advantage over an organic life form due to it's assumably greater than
human capacity for memory and precision, etc.

I'd be curious to hear some feedback on this as well; I've always
wondered if/suspected that more sophisticated "androids" akin to the
Yeleth were possible, and might even have been used as substitutes for
humans in some circumstances.  Whether they could be made to effectively
duplicate a particuar individual (a la _The Stepford Wives_ or
_Futureworld_), or perhaps only play the role of an actual human (not
necessarily duplicating a "real" person) so well that few would guess, I
don't know.

I certainly would think such creations could perform "spells"; even if
only as a "hard wired" circuit akin to an eye or other device.  Whether a 
more generic "programmable" spell device would be possible, I don't 
know, though the descriptions of the Mihalli's "Orbs of Immediate 
Eventuation" sound somewhat like that.

Otulengba,

Ah, I see I misinterpreted Mr. Grandidge's question. I thought he 
meant "marked" as in "marked by an Aspect of the God." This doesn't 
happen.

As for marking documents, the Servitors of Silence use a copy of 
the Seal that apparently has its own magical properties. While the 
original Seal stays in its secret vault, this copy is employed to 
put the Imperial mark on documents, etc., as Mr. Grandidge supposed. 
This is done in order to keep the original (and only!) Seal clear of 
contamination. The copy apparently has been imbued with sorcerous 
power that keep it from being forged. Nearly every Imperial document 
coming out of the Golden Tower has this copy used upon it.

I suppose that putting the copy to the forehead or hand of a human 
would indeed leave an impression. As far as I know, this is not done.

Hope this clarifies matters.

Regards,

Phil

[Moderator's Note:  Phil responds to Jeff Butler's question about Yeleth and ]
[                   Ru'un.                                                   ]`

The Ru'un and Yeleth are both creations of he Lords of the later Latter 
Times, almost at the end before the centuries of turmoil that preceded 
the Empire of Llyan of Tsamra. Some have said that these devices (for
such they are) were created by the ancient priests of Ksarul or Hru'u, 
but this is almost certainly erroneous. There may still be a few 
scholars who can effect repairs and possibly even perform a little 
simple reprogramming (e.g. "attack only encountered creatures wearing 
mostly blue instead of 'all' invaders of the Underworlds"). I don't 
even know if this is possible any more.

As for reprogramming them to use magical power, I have strong doubts 
that this was ever done or even attempted. These artificial intelli-
gences employ "brains" that are very different from organic brains, 
and apparently one needs the full complexity and range of an organic 
brain in order to set up and activate the magical "circuit boards" to 
which I have referred. There may have been an exception or two over 
the millennia, but I have never come across one. It would also be 
impossible for anyone today to perform such reprogramming. If it were 
done by the creators themselves, then .. well, hmmm, maybe... But I 
doubt it.

After all, the reasons for creating artificial intelligences of these 
types were to take the place of (and do better than) magical creatures 
and beings that were being devised in considerable numbers by the 
savants who served this or that Lord of the Latter Times. Robotic 
creatures (the many forms of Ru'un) were first, and undoubtedly dated 
from before the Latter Times themselves, when they were invented to 
perform unpleasant tasks, e.g. service tubeways and underground power 
stations, see to machines and distribution, and do a myriad other jobs 
that neither humans nor aliens wanted to do on Tekumel, the Retirement 
World. As time went on, some of these robots (many different forms -- 
not all bipedal and humanoid in shape by any means) were selected to 
guard valuables (tombs, treasures, etc.), and as the Latter Times came 
to a close, various of these automatons were given further tasks that 
could be done mindlessly and endlessly, with a minimum of repair and 
damage control. Many of these machines perished, of course, while others 
have become inoperative. Some still exist, and there are still robotic 
service centres somewhere beneath Tekumel's surface, reachable, perhaps, 
only by the machines themselves or by occasional intrepid adventurers. 
Identity cards and eyeprint checks are almost always required, and 
unwanted intruders are escorted out -- or otherwise dealt with.

The Yeleth is another sort of being. Colloidal androids (usually with 
some metal or plastic components) were created as servants and 
"decorations" by the Lords of the Latter Times. Beautiful females 
(and handsome males) were employed to guard, serve, entertain, and act 
as literate "companions" for the effete masters of those long-lost 
domains. Somehow, once the Latter Times ended and there was chaos and a 
loss of technological know-how, the Yeleth managed to become independent, 
with more thinking power than most Ru'un. They took to dwelling in the 
Underworlds here and there. They are not frequent and usually exist only 
in small communities, rarely coming to the surface. They subsist on small 
animals, carrion, lichens and cave-flora, and occasional adventurers who 
wander into their realms. The Yeleth have altered their original mold, 
rather subtly and with considerable effect: they have developed a 
hypnotic power and some intelligence of their own, including some form 
of communication. They control a few sites in the catacombs where they 
are able to reproduce their own kind (as full-size adults -- no Yeleth 
rugrats, sorry!). They can imitate (though not speak?) human language, 
and their mimicry is so good that they can call out in the voices of 
humans they have overheard. They cannot or do not communicate with
humans otherwise, but treat them as prey. They may also combat (and 
consume?) other denizens of the Underworlds, such as Kurgha, Qol, etc. 
They seem to appear only in human form -- there are no animal or 
nonhuman Yeleth, to my knowledge.

Neither Ru'un nor Yeleth (nor Qol, nor Hra, nor any others of the 
so-called "Underpeople" can perform magic. This appears to be limited 
solely to humans and the sentient nonhuman races. Devices can be 
programmed to perform one single "magical" task, of course, by setting 
up the right "circuit board" and programming it -- just as a human 
"programmes" a handgrenade to explode by pulling the pin, or a security 
alarm to go off when a light-beam is broken. This type of simple "magic" 
could indeed be programmed into a Ru'un, but it would have no power to 
alter the "spell" or to devise new ones. Once set, the "board" would 
perform its function as long as the being existed.

None of this is straightforward or simple, given the complexity of 
history on Tekumel. I hope it helps a little...

Regards,

Phil

TEKUMEL-CON UPDATE

Things with the long-promised Tekumel-Con have been going very slowly,
for reasons too many and too feeble to mention.  However, I've got 
momentum building up, and lots of progress has been made recently.

What follows is a summary of the text of a promotional flyer being
distributed at the TOME/PhD tables at GenCon.  Actually, all the 
text is here; you're just missing the formatting and Red Devastation
Legionnaire graphic :-).

Many of you will soon receive this very flyer in the mail, along with 
some other Con-related materials.  Watch this space for more news.

= = = The Flyer = = =

                        TEKUMEL-CON

Just as the name suggests, Tekumel-Con is a convention dedicated to 
Professor M.A.R. Barker's world of fantasy adventure, gaming and 
literature.  A convention for mature, sophisticated gamers who appreciate 
the cultural richness and fantasy-realism of Tekumel.  This is guaranteed 
to be a once-in-a-lifetime experience not to be missed!

IS THIS THING FOR REAL?
	You bet!  We're going to gather Tekumel fans from around the 
world for a weekend devoted to Tekumel gaming, seminars, discussion 
and camaraderie.  

THE TEKUMEL-CON PHILOSOPHY
	Tekumel-Con will be a sophisticated event for mature, sophisticated
gamers.  More than just a collection of tournaments, it will be a place to 
come together and share quality gaming ideas; a forum to recognize 
Tekumel as one of the very best gaming worlds that the hobby has to 
offer.
	Tekumel-Con will be the best opportunity to talk and game 
Tekumel, for a whole weekend, ever organized.  Let's face it-99% of all 
Tekumel fans are starved for lack of local campaigns and convention 
tournaments.
	Tekumel-Con will be not be in some run-down hotel that gives us 
the cheapest rate.  Tekumel gamers are mature, and we understand you 
expect a certain amount of comfort.  The hotel will add to, not detract 
from, your enjoyment of the weekend.  This is not to say that cost will be 
prohibitive; we are targeting a room rate of about $70 per night, shared 
by all room occupants.
	Tekumel-Con will be Minneapolis, Minnesota.  This is to ensure 
that Professor Barker can attend.  We understand that many of you will 
have to travel great distances.  We the organizers will do everything we 
can to make sure this is a once-in-a-lifetime-great gaming experience, 
one worth planning a whole vacation around.

GUEST OF HONOR
	Professor M.A.R. Barker (who else?).  Professor Barker has been 
creating Tekumel since the 1940's, and has been publishing gaming 
material since 1975.  He is the undisputed Father of Tekumel.

GUESTS OF NOTE
	Professor Barker isn't going to carry the celebrity load all by 
himself.  All the following folks have contributed to Tekumel in their own 
way, and will be on hand to share their insights and suggestions with us:  
Neil Cauley - author of Gardasiyal, the most recent incarnation of 
Tekumel RPG rules.  Dave Morris and Steve Foster - past and present 
editors of The Eye of All-Seeing Wonder, the indispensable British 
Tekumel fanzine.  Wes Postlethwaite and Larry Hull - of PhD Games, 
producers of the classic 25mm Tekumel figures and soon-to-released 
wargaming rules.  Bob Alberti - author of the forthcoming encycloaedic 
tome of Tekumelyani religion, Mitlanyal.  Ed Wimble - of Theatre of the 
Mind Enterprises, publishers of Tekumel products since 1992.  Mark 
Daniels - world-hopping Tekumel scholar extraordinaire, and frequent 
contributor to The Eye.  Rob Smith and John Medway - Texan producers 
of 15mm Tekumel figures, and the Light of Action companion rules.  
Andrew Lorince - long time convention presence and dealer of rare 
products.  James Roach - Publisher of the fanzine Realms of Wonder.  
Sandy Petersen - better known for designing Call of Cthulhu and Doom 
(yes, that Doom), Sandy is also a big Tekumelphile.  And many more . . . 
really!  We're still working to line up more authors and artists who have 
contributed to the Tekumel universe over the years.

WHAT KINDS OF THINGS WILL BE GOING ON?
	Tournaments!  * Role-playing -Gardasiyal, Tirikelu, Swords & 
Glory, and maybe even some good ol' Empire of the Petal Throne.  
Miniatures -Missum!, Qadardalikoi, Light of Action, and probably some 
other home-grown systems.  * Board gaming - the mark of a real 
Tekumel fan is his ownership of War of Wizards, plus others.  * Seminars 
- "Tekumelyani Religion" hosted by Bob Alberti, "Gardasiyal Q&A" 
hosted by Neil Cauley, and of course several sessions of Professor Barker 
talking about whatever comes to mind.  * Live-Action Gaming - We're 
probably going to have a big live-action game, for the total-Tekumelyani 
immersion experience.  * Please contact us for the fully detailed pre-
registration booklet!
	We're offering a lot, but _we still want more_.  If you've got an 
idea for a tournament or seminar, please consider running it.  We need GMs 
for tournaments we'll provide.  We also need volunteers for tasks like 
registration.  Volunteers and GMs will get discounted entry.

RARE MERCHANDISE FOR SALE
	Of course, the full line of in-print Tekumel products will be 
available for purchase.  We will certainly also have an auction, to give 
you a chance to get those rare long out-of-print items you only wish you 
had (or the chance to unload the ones you've got).  There might even be 
some never-published items for sale too.


WHEN:  Thursday, June 6th - Monday, June 9th, 1997  (not finalized)

WHERE:  Tekumel-Con will be held in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  The 
hotel will be less than 20 minutes from both the airport and the fabled 
Mall of America.  Inexpensive shuttle service will be available to and 
from both.

FOR MORE INFORMATION:  Please contact David Cheng * 313 East 85th 
Street, Apt 2C * New York, NY 10028 USA * (212) 472-7752 *

Can't speak for the Prof's gamers, but we have had 'intelligent' responses 
from 'swords', 'wands', and all sort of TMD's.  My especial favourite was 
an  aircar that wouldn't let the players carry non-humans, and an 
arachnoform tubecar tunnel cleaning device that was very very depressed 
indeed.

None of the players have ever been able to tell whether they were up 
against (or in some cases going along with) a machine or an organic 
being.  One of the beautiful things about tekumel is that there is no 
real difference between a demon living in an artifact and a 6 trillion 
megahertz decium processor in a microchip:- it is the personality that 
counts, not the technology.

As to the 'superior powers' of advanced AI's, why should this be so?  
Perhaps the inaccuracy of magic, the limits to power and the relative 
unpredictability are inherent in the quantum microstructure of the 
Tekumel continuum?

[Moderator's Note:   David Chatterjee asks about Tumissa, and the western ]
[                    part of the empire in general. (Phil, I injected a   ]
[                    question down by the Pachi Lei section.)             ]

>First, on geography:
 
>The two or three lines on the city in the old Sourcebook put it on the

>mountainous in general? There are no active volcanoes? (Hmakuyal is in

The Tumissa map will be up on the FTP site by the time you read this, 
along with Fasiltum, Thri'il, and Sa'a Allaqiyar. These are computer-
generated, but they look pretty good, and they work.

[Moderator's Note:  They are there.                                       ]

Tumissa is built around the shores of a lake inside a volcanic crater 
that has the eastern side broken down. The Turina River flows out of 
this, although this is only a branch of the Turin River that emerges 
in the depths of the Chakan Forests and passes Tumissa to the east. 
It travels south to Butrus and farther down to Urmish and empties out 
into the Deeps of Chanayaga at Penom. It is not navigable by anything 
larger than a rowboat for most of its length.

The lake inside the crater is named Nettu Tlakan, and it is apparently 
fed from deep springs inside the crater itself at some level or other. 
The volcano has been extinct since long before the First Imperium. 
Hmakuyal to the east is dry; the volcano there is also long extinct.

>Second, on current entertainments:

>might we expect to find in Tumissa at the moment? (Eg. surely the
>Legion of the Lord of Red Devastation has not returned from Mirusiya's
>side since the Imperial succession.) 

Many, many interrelated questions! The Governor is still old Tsumikel. 
Dhich'une didn't rock any boats and carefully kept those officials in 
office who did not actively oppose him. This didn't stop Tumissa from 
declaring for Mirusiya, however, although Eselne took a lot of wind 
out of their sails by demanding that the Tumissan legions join him 
instead -- and threatening a blockade if they did not. The Governor has 
judiciously played both hands against the middle, and the city is still 
fairly independent. Princess Ma'in was there for a while but has now 
moved to Jakalla, and Princess Arimala (the sculptress who gave up the 
Gold) still lives there.

The Mu'ugalavyani showed up and demanded that Tumissa surrender, but 
they didn't try very hard to besiege it, and when the Pe Choi 
threatened to cut their lines of communication across Do Chaka, they 
retreated in good order.

Red Devastation is still with Mirusiya near Avanthar. Its components 
have changed considerably since it left Tumissa. The Governor's 
crossbow legion is still with him, but it, too, likes Mirusiya. It 
stayed home to defend Tumissa against all comers: Eselne, Dhich'une, 
the Red Hats, or Rereshqala.

Hmakuyal has always been quite aloof from Tumissa. Ksarul devotees 
just don't mix well with Vimuhla's followers. There is thus not much 
interaction. The Ito are farther north, in Do Chaka itself. They 
interact with certain Pe Choi factions but not much with either Tumissa 
or Paya Gupa.

>Say hypothetically a pro-Vimuhla legion based in Tumissa was fighting

This is a tough question. The answer depends on local commanders and 
local situations and probably cannot be answered in general, abstract 
terms. Chances are that home and deity would matter more than current 
assignment to Eselne. It would thus want to be close to Tumissa or 
close to a strong Vimuhla worshipping candidate. A general has no 
freedom -- legally -- to switch sides, any more than a British general 
would have to join the IRA! Personal, clan, and religious "druthers" 
might make such a legion defect, switch sides, or even just go home 
and till the crops, however.

This is a case-by-case problem. It's always better to have things 
happen smoothly and without lasting friction, and even Eselne would 
see it, I think. There are precedents in history for letting a legion 
go home -- and there are other precedents when a tough and stubborn 
leader demanded loyalty to the death against a legion's own co-
religionists, clan, or city. Sometimes such leaders won out, and at 
other times they bought the proverbial farm and were slain by their 
own mutinous troops.

>And if all that's too easy, what's the current plight of Butrus and
>Paya Gupa?

Butrus was taken by the Red Hats, who still occupy it with the aid 
of local factions favourable to them. The Pachi Lei were driven into 
the forests or eastwards towards Urmish. There was an awful massacre 
of these peaceful nonhumans, and the Pachi Lei then mounted a counter-
massacre, which ended in something of a stalemate. I wouldn't want to 
be a Mu'ugalavyani sentry or patrol outside of the walls of Butrus!

[Moderator's Note:  Phil, just what is the deal with the Red Hats and     ]
[                   the Pachi Lei?  You describe the Pachi Lei as         ]
[                   peaceful, yet they are always massacring (sp?) the    ]
[                   Red Hats.  I know that their hatred of one another    ]
[                   now has grown from things in the past, massacres and  ]
[                   counter-massacres, but what was the first event that  ]
[                   started the whole situation?                          ]

Paya Gupa is another case: the Red Hats made a faint attempt to scare 
the city into surrendering, but the Thumis Adept, Lord Gamulu, is a 
staunch follower of Prince Eselne, and he made some counterthreats 
that made the Mu'ugalavyani think twice. They knew they couldn't take 
the city without major siege units, supplies, and time; they thus 
retreated into the forest -- just in time to get slapped around a 
little by the Pe Choi, who were angry at the treatment of the Pachi 
Lei and also at the thinly veiled attempt to take over the governing 
of the Chakas entirely. Rather than fight a guerrilla war in dense 
jungle against a nonhuman foe who knew every inch of the place, the 
Red Hats backed off.

This is about where it stands right now, in the middle of summer in 
2,367.

Phil

The Goddess Avanthe is involved with water, the seas, rain, etc. She

Bob Alberti, who is working on "Mitlanyal" to comment, too, if you

I think there was an old Tekumel Journal article on the Meshqu Plaques. 
Perhaps somebody could send Mark a copy of it? It might be fun. I can 
provide more colours and designs, if needed.

Most of the Hlaka are still on duty in Tsolyanu. They tend to stay 
abroad for long periods of time, and there are enough at home to keep 
the Ssu out of their territory. I think Mirusiya has a Hlaka legion or 
parts of it, and there are troops with Reresqala and Eselne, too. I 
don't know if any of the northern units went over to Dhich'une or not.

>is currently "controlled" by rebel Pe Choi (at least as long as Prince
>Eselne's soldiers aren't around)?  I would suppose that many have returned

The Pe Choi legions in the Empire have had various fates: most have 
stayed on, loyal to their officers and to the prince paying their 
salaries. Some troops have indeed gone home. A few have bcome bandits 
and have ravaged areas around the central Empire, even near Katalal 
and Usenanu. Each Pe Choi band seems to have a mind of its own.

>I would also imagine that the Pachi Lei are

Prince Eselne hasn't had much luck in the south. Rereshqala appeals 
more to the peaceable Pachi Lei. Eselne's Pachi Lei are still with 
him, but he has posted them to the north, where they can't defect 
easily. He has encouraged the Pachi Lei to fight against the Red Hats, 
but Rereshqala has done the same thing, with better luck. The Pachi 
Lei refugees around Urmish and Katalal have largely gone over to 
Rereshqala, although they haven't proved very effective fighters yet. 
Not many of their species seem to favour a career as soldiers. There 
are old, traditional families of Pachi Lei in many of the Tsolyani 
cities, of course, who have adapted to human ways and ideas, and this 
is where many of the best Pachi Lei soldiers come from. Many of these 
are linked to the Stability temples and ideals, which Rereshqala 
personifies more than does Eselne -- and certainly not Dhich'une or 
Mirusiya. The new Ksarul rince, Taksuru, is appealing, of course, but 
he's too new to have garnered mcuh allegiance from these supporters yet.

Phil

[Moderator's Note:  The Professor expounds upon Yeleth and Ru'un some more,  ]

The Lords of the Latter Times did experiment with both robots and 
organic androids, as well as biologically engineered "mutants." 
With robots (many forms of Ru'un), they did not need to arm them 
with magic -- they still had considerable technology, and sorcerous 
methods were fairly new and untried. Later came the Yeleth and 
various other "sorcerous" artificial intelligences. Robots were 
frequently used as guards, servants, mechanics, and artisans. The 
Yeleth and a few other android-varieties were employed as companions, 
decorations, sex-partners, etc. They were not often armed with 
anything -- and frequently had built-in commands that prevented them 
from attacking or even defending themselves. When the Latter Times 
were drawing down to a close, somebody or something altered the 
mold for the Yeleth (and certain other artificial creatures, 
creating hostile and independent entities that had no love for their 
former masters and mistresses. These newer versions still could not 
cast magic -- except as a single spell, programmed in by their 
creators, much like an "Eye." Nobody seemed to have envisioned a need 
for independent artificial intelligences that had a repertory of 
spells to cast freely and at will! That was probably a wise decision...

I think that hard-wired single spells (like "Eyes") were indeed 
occasionally added to very late models of the Ru'un and the Yeleth 
(and to some others, not all of which have perhaps been seen by 
visitors to Tekumel). Many of these seem to have perished or gone 
defunct over the ages, but there may still be a few around. (Moral: 
if a Yeleth points a finger at you, duck!)

[Moderator's Note:  Kenji Schwarz asks about the geography of Tekumel and  ]
[                   also about Salarvya.                                   ]

I have a few quick questions (and one longer one) for the Blueroom group
about the geography of "known Tekumel," Maps 1-4.

On these large-scale maps, there are several settlements which are not
clearly part of a described state, nor are they mentioned (except perhaps
in passing) in published materials.  I'm curious to know a little more
about them -- who lives there, what their political status is with regard
to neighboring countries, and what they might be like to visit.

1)  The coastal cities in the Unknown Forest:  Port Chanul and Dale'e.  Are
these Livyani outposts?  Mu'ugalavyani?  Something else?

2)  Ssamris Isle:  Is this under Mu'ugalavyani or Tsolyani jurisdiction at
the present time?  (Or Livyani?)  Its location could make it, perhaps, an
important port along the sea lanes, but is not mentioned (that I can find)
in any released materials.

3)  The Isles of Ill Winds, with the town of Mardza.  This is not part of
the Ahoggya lands, nor of the Nyemesel Islands, is it?  Who or what lives
here?

4)  The Farise Isles, and the town of Ai'is.  Are these islands part of the
Salarvyani feudal domain, or part of Rannalu (or the Nom lands)?  Again,
what are the islands and their inhabitants like?

5)  The towns in Rannalu (Birchan, Tkemar, Hlame'e, Mimore)--given the
"band"-type social structure and nomadic economy of the inhabitants of
Rannalu, how did these settlements arise, and who lives in them?

Obviously, given the remoteness and obscurity of most of these places, one
should expect fanciful and inexact travelers' tales.  Nonetheless, a few
reliable pointers or basic facts would be greatly appreciated.

8)  I've also wondered about the cultural cohesiveness of Salarvya.  Bob
Dushay's recent Blueroom article on western coastal Map 3 Salarvya got me
thinking about this again.  Salarvya as a whole extends over 7000 Tsan from
east to west, which, given the slowness of normal travel and communication
on Tekumel, suggests little contact between, say, Elelun and Chame'el.  The
fragmented, feudal political structure and the (apparent) absence of a
powerful centralized religious or cultural authority extending over the
entire country would also seem to encourage cultural drift as one moves
away from the "center" of Tsatsayagga.

I would tend to imagine that there is a great amount of variation in
language,  material and symbolic culture, and probably even physical
appearance as one travels from one end of Salarvya to the other.  Is this
correct?  If so, could the Professor perhaps mention a few key points in
which the "Far East" of Salarvya is different from the better-known western
regions?

If, on the other hand, there _is_ socio-cultural-linguistic homogeneity in
Salarvya comparable to that found in the other Five Empires, why is this?
What historical forces created the uniformity across this huge area, and
why does it persist?

[Moderator's Note:  Adam Levine provides the following story dealing with   ]
[                   Yeleth and Ru'un from a campaign he was in.             ]

>I would like to learn more about the Yeleth and Ru'un - specifically how

The following is a brief description of events that occurred long ago 
in an adventure under Jakalla:

After our adventure with the Hluss, we returned to Jakalla where we 
each became involved in Temple life.  However, the friendship build 
between the player characters from shared adversity lasted.  The 
Temples of Ksarul and Sarku approached their followers in our group 
to pursue a cache of records in The Domed City.  It was hoped that 
these record would identify the precise astrological configuration 
that signaled the last ditlana of Jakalla.  With this information, 
it would be possible to force the new ditlana of Jakalla now long
overdue.  There are many powerful individuals and groups that stand 
to gain or suffer if such an event were to transpire.  We were 
cautioned to be mindful of opposition to our efforts.

We accepted our mission.  Well provisioned, we entered the 
underworld through an opening in the necropolis maintained by the 
Temple of Sarku.  The instructions that we were given were both 
clear and cryptic.  We were told to descend down a series of wide 
stairways avoiding any branches until we found an  Engsvanyali 
sewer.  In an offhand way, we were told that if we were to 
investigate the wrong side passage while going down, then we might 
happen onto a shrine to one of the Pariah Gods that has been known 
to melt the bones of anyone who looked upon it.  We were motivated 
not to do too much exploring.

At the end of the sewer, we found the River of Silence.  There, our 
instructions indicated that we were to fire off a chemical fire pot 
that was extra bright.  After about fifteen minutes, we began having 
tsoggyu problems. Fighting furiously, you can imagine our surprise 
when a hover barge came wisking over the river with people (ru'un) 
firing mounted lightning bringers into the undead.  Momentarily 
distracted and stunned, the tsoggyu were sufficiently disoriented to
enable us to jump onto the barge and make our escape.  The perfectly 
formed male crew refused or, more likely, were incapable of speaking 
to us.  They took us to Katalan's island.  

Katalan is an Engsvanyali ru'un that runs a safe house/fortress near 
the far side of the River of Silence.  A real gentlerobot, we were 
served thousand year old rations (for which Katalan apologized) and 
had a very interesting conversation about the current Emperor of 
Engsvanyali.  He doesn't know or refuses to accept that Ensvanyali 
has fallen.  He also asked if we knew when replacements and parts 
would be coming, explaining that they were in great need.  We were 
each shown to personal sleeping quarters.  The bed sheets fell apart
at a touch.  Katalan was apologetic about the accomodations.  The 
beds had two small prongs protruding from the location of a sleeper's 
lower back that made it impossible to use the beds.  We assumed that 
the ru'un used these beds to somehow replenish their power.  
Throughout our visit, we saw many other humanoid constructs.  
However, only Katalan could speak and appeared to operate correctly.

After sleeping on the floor, we went on our way across a rickety bridge 
to The Domed City.  Incidently, I broke a slat in the bridge and was 
scratched badly by tsogyyu waiting below.

As far as Avanthe goes, there's little to add.  Here are the actual
entries from Mitlanyal:

4) E'eth of the Rains
She it is who brings the rain to water the fields; her older sister
Quyela, who fertilizes the crops, and her oldest sister is Chikuna, who
ripens the crops and causes them to be ready for the harvest.  E'eth has
no shrines or images but is worshipped in the fields by priests and
priestesses specially trained in her rituals.  If she does not respond
and rain does not come, farmers may then appeal to Qalai, the Maintainer
of Cycles.

16) Bolende, the Lord of the Spirits of Water.
Like Niluelde, Hlikarsh, and Dede he is charged with the demons of a
specific realm.  He is the patron of those missing at sea, of ships that
are becalmed, of the creatures of the water (both fresh and salt), of
cretins beings from other Planes where water is the medium of existence,
and of sunken treasures.  His images are shaped like swimming fish with
high dorsal fins and long serpentine tails.  His shrines are simple
stone platforms, found along the banks of a lake, river, or ocean, and
his only sacrifices are fresh fish (not crustaceans or eel-like
creatures).

It's important to remember, however, that Aspects are very localized.
In Avanthe's Temple, aspects number 18 through 24 are listed as
"localized", along with some others.  Fishing villages will usually have
aspects dedicated to the movement of the schools of fish, the safe
conduct of boats, or the flow of currents.  These will differ in name
and appearance based on the history and tradition of the area.  So if
your players are in Penom and about to undertake a hazardous journey,
they could be directed to the local aspect "Ta'al of Smooth Waters"  who
sees to the steady rhythm of the waves and their moderate perpetuation,
neither too large or too small.  

Upon landing in Jakalla, they would not find a shrine to Ta'al.  A few
of the local clergy may have heard of her, but that would be due only to
the frequency of commerce between the two cities and not any doctrinal
support.  Bolende's shrines are found all over the wharves in Jakalla,
however, so your players would have no shortage opportunity to sacrifice
their next voyage.

Elsewhere, Avanthe's foreign counterparts have even greater aquatic
emphasis.  The Lady Shiringgayi of Salarvya  has several oceanic
Aspects, and  the Mreshshel-Atl Lineage of Lake Mrissutl has its own
secret Aspect related to the lake which they do not reveal to those
outside their lineage.

Here's more from Mitlanyal in this regard:

"Whenever there is a great storm, when a ship feared lost returns
safely, when a son is born to the master, etc., it is customary among
the coastal-dwelling Salarvyani priests to oversee the raising of a
stone monolith on the seashore.

Such monuments are inscribed with protective runes, and offerings of
animals, sea creatures, and occasionally slaves are made to them.  These
runes seek Shiringgayi's protection from storms, shipwreck and the like,
and especially protection against the sleek pirate galleys of the Haida
Pakalani, who practice a similar custom."

The aforementioned Haida Pakalani worship their own version of
Shiriggayi named Mretten (which, two interpretations removed from
Tsolyanu, is becoming quite different):

"Known as She Who Strides the Wind, Her symbol is that of two tridents
side-by-side, like three fingered hands.  It is inscribed ship-bows and
guard against Her."

Mretten of Haida Pakala is known as She Who Walks Upon the Sea in the
nearby Nyemesel Isles, where she is not quite as viciously perceived as
in Haida Pakala, and her trident symbol is interpreted as the Two Hands
of Mretten.

The Ghatoni worship "Onudza the Rain who not only fertilizes the crops,
but is connected to storms, the sea, typhoons, and darkness.  Before a
voyage, slaves are sacrificed from the ship to satiate the gods."  

The Northeast States have their own interpretations of the Engsvanyali
theology, along with their own complex mythology.  Occupants of largely
mountainous regions, there is correspondingly less emphasis upon aquatic
deities.  The Pechani worship an interesting pantheon, which includes
Setha, Mother of Children, Scatterer of Seeds, Bringer of Rain and
Harvests, Singer and Dancer of Festivals (another Avanthe/Dlamelish
combination, to the Tsolyani, though the Pechani have their own
mythology which has nothing to do with the Mitlanyal.)

The secretive Livyani have two gods who are obviously related to the
ocean.  The Sea-Goddess of Kakarsha is the patroness of sailors and
oceangoing travelers.  Possibly related to Avanthe, She has special
control over the sea and its creatures.  And The Lost One of the Sea who
combines the attributes of Dlamelish, Avanthe and Thumis, and is also
associated with the sea.  Fisheries, ships, and algae ponds are operated
by the Temple of the Lost One of the Sea on the eastern coast, and the
temple complex of the Lost One of the Sea in Laigas is extensive.

The Nom, of course, spend most of their lives at sea, and thus they
worship Kaa, Pei and To'u, gods of the Sea and Fertility, Storms, and
the Night respectively.  To'u is included because he is said to have
underwater shrines and temples of some sort.

So those are a few of the water-related gods of Tekumel.  I'm out of
time so I hope this will suffice.

>On these large-scale maps, there are several settlements which are not

>about them -- who lives there, what their political status is with regard

>1)  The coastal cities in the Unknown Forest:  Port Chanul and Dale'e.  Are
>these Livyani outposts?  Mu'ugalavyani?  Something else?

Most of the settlements and towns not included in any nations with 
boundaries (e.g. Port Chanul, Dale'e, etc.) are indeed independent or 
at least semi-autonomous. They are either too far or too economically 
undesirable to make them a target for anything except a passing raid and 
demand for cash. The Mu'ugalavyani, the Shen, and the pirates of Tsolei 
have all descended on Dale'e from time to time, usually without lasting 
effects. Port Chanul borders on the Tane Peninsula that leafs off the map 
to the east, to one of the enclaves of the Black Ssu. It is not only 
independent but also owner of some enterprising little pirate ships of 
its own. The merchants of Port Chanul sell pitch, timber, furs,fish, and 
other marine products to other towns farther along the coast, out to Tane. 
They rarely trade down to the Tsolei Archipelago, or back all the way to 
Mu'ugalavya -- although the new military road down from Gashchne to the 
northern shores of the bay directly south of it may make it easier to do 
this in future.

There is just too much of Tekumel to talk about! I could not include all 
of these little settlements and remote towns in my descriptions! There 
are many others: e.g. Ai'is in the Farise Isles on the far eastern coast 
of Salarvya -- who have never heard of Tsatsayagga!

>2)  Ssamris Isle:  Is this under Mu'ugalavyani or Tsolyani jurisdiction at
>the present time?  (Or Livyani?)  Its location could make it, perhaps, an
>important port along the sea lanes, but is not mentioned (that I can find)
>in any released materials.

Ssamris is now in Mu'ugalavyani hands. The Livyani have owned it, and some 
Shen mercenaries took it for awhile; then the Hluss invaded and ravaged 
it pretty thoroughly. When they left, the Tsolyani established a trading 
mission, as did the Mu'ugalavyani, AND the Livyani. The island is a free 
market and mercantile meeting place. It is pretty wild and lawless. 
Squalid, too.

>3)  The Isles of Ill Winds, with the town of Mardza.  This is not part of
>the Ahoggya lands, nor of the Nyemesel Islands, is it?  Who or what lives
>here?

Who knows? This is *very* remote and unlikely to be visited, even by the 
most intrepid sailors. It is probably inhabited by eastern Salarvyani 
blown off course and stranded by the winds and tides. There are Ahoggya 
there, too, of course, but nobody knows what resources the place has or 
how it is governed -- if at all. Fish, shells, oils from marine creatures 
-- plus certain mysterious narcotics -- are the only know exports, very 
very rarely traded northward to Fort Vrusaggu and Khirre. The place is 
claimed by the Salarvyani, but as far as I know, they have no presence 
there. The only report I have ever had was from one Captain Harchar, a 
vicious pirate, who said it was a pretty little town until he had 
finished with it -- no pretty girls, though, and he could never get
excited about sex with the Ahoggya. If you want to look, go right ahead...

>4)  The Farise Isles, and the town of Ai'is.  Are these islands part of the
>Salarvyani feudal domain, or part of Rannalu (or the Nom lands)?  Again,
>what are the islands and their inhabitants like?

Mentioned above. The Salarvyani of Elelun and Mimore deal with the 
fisherfolk of the Farise Isles, but they are so very remote that no 
one really knows or cares.  The Nom visit them, too. See the article 
on these people in the Bestiary.

>5)  The towns in Rannalu (Birchan, Tkemar, Hlame'e, Mimore)--given the
>"band"-type social structure and nomadic economy of the inhabitants of
>Rannalu, how did these settlements arise, and who lives in them?

Settled by exiles, bandits, and enterprising colonists up from the 
coastal plains of eastern and central Salarvya. They all speak one 
dialect or other of Salarvyani, and they generally fit into the cultural 
patterns of "rural" Salarvya. There are older sub-strata, of course. 
Tkemar is influenced by the humans now inhabiting Mihallu, while Birchan 
tends to be more tribal, with Salarvyani and Rannaluyani elements mixed 
together. Mimore is a clear offshoot from Elelun: Salarvyani fisherfolk, 
with merchants and sturdy peasants occupying hamlets and little fields in 
the coves along the coast. Hlame'e is a weird place: desert tribesemen, 
mixed with Salarvyani, and including some silent and uncooperative nomads 
from the Plains of Glass. Some guides can be found there who can take you 
across to the Crater of the Unstraightened City -- if Metallja's guards 
don't catch you!

Most travellers have never heard of these places. You might find an 
occasional wanderer who has seen them, but you'll have to hunt!

>8)  I've also wondered about the cultural cohesiveness of Salarvya.  Bob
>Dushay's recent Blueroom article on western coastal Map 3 Salarvya got me
>thinking about this again.  Salarvya as a whole extends over 7000 Tsan from

You are mainly correct. Salarvya is a nation in name only. The great 
"families" do lay claim to areas within their own enclaves and spheres of 
influence, and there was a time when Bendalljan colonists and later 
Ensgvanyali missions and traders wandered out to settle along the fertile 
southern coasts. There has always been shipping and marine contact, with 
frequent pushes in from the sea to settle the northern  regions just south 
of Rannalu. There is the religion if Lady Shiringgayi, of course, plus the 
linguistic heritage and accompanying cultural attitudes and mores that 
hold the "nation" together (in the loosest sense!). There have also been 
occasional powerful leaders who have kept the Salarvyani banners flying way 
out in such outposts as Jaekanta and Retsullu. But not for long and not 
without a lot of local cultural changes. There is still an intense desire 
to maintain the linguistic links between all of the Salarvyani regions -- 
somewhat as the Chinese dialects all managed to keep the same written
structure while modifying the spoken forms of their dialect/language 
greatly.

The lords of Jaekanta are not likely to offer more than lip-service to 
the "king" in Tsatsayagga, but they still like to think they're speaking 
and writing "The King's Salarvyani." 
 
>I would tend to imagine that there is a great amount of variation in

>correct? 

Asolutely right. This could be the subject of a whole book! I can only 
urge you to look at the Zocchi version of the "Sourcebook" (until Chris 
gets vol. 3 up on the FTP site!). I wish I had time for it, and maybe I 
will indeed get off a few dollops of information soon -- if I can find 
the time.

>If, on the other hand, there _is_ socio-cultural-linguistic homogeneity in
>Salarvya comparable to that found in the other Five Empires, why is this?

There _is_ some homogeneity because of historical connections and origins. 
But there are many, many changes, too. It would be hard for a native of 
Jaekanta to communicate with a Tsatsayaggani. Rather like me listening to 
a Cockney fellow one time in Hong Kong: he was expounding at length on 
world politics, but I could only tell he was talking about Germany because 
he kept saying "I'-lah" (Hitler)! The rest I could not fathom.

I played in Craig Smith's (the artist from Swords and Glory as well 
as other publications) semi-official offshoot of the Professor's  
campaign in the 70's.  On one adventure at sea, we ran into an island 
that had once been an R&R facility for the military during the Latter 
Times (or some such ancient period).  There was a class of Ru'un 
there that was much more intelligent than the run-of-the-mill 
tomb guardian type (yes, I know they really aren't run-of-the-mill).  
These had some kind of energy blaster instead of the usual bolt 
caster, and seemed better armored as well (drawing in Tekumel Journal 
#1, p. 17).  They thought we were soldiers on R&R and treated us 
accordingly.  They could interact, answer questions, etc.  They knew 
Tsolyani, which was remarkable in its own sense.  The problem was 
that we didn't have any orders that said we could leave, so they 
attempted to prevent our departure in a rather non-violent manner, at 
least at first (they didn't want us to go AWOL).  We did manage to 
escape (with three energy pistols) and only losing one party member. 
(We later lost the energy pistols to the Vru'uneb in Tsamra, but 
that's another story.)  An Imperial Dispatch in The Imperial Military 
Journal (Vol. II, #5, Winter 2360 - mislabelled #4) appeared 
describing these events.

Brett's recollection is exact. Craig Smith took some of his campaign 
ideas directly from mine, and the "lost islands: in the southern seas 
was one of them.  The Ru'un there are much more sophisticated than 
the run-of-the-mill storeroom guard or or service robot. The problem 
is that the R-n-R base is absolutely unalterable and fixed by any 
methods the Tsolyani have today (think of Amazonian jungle tribesmen 
in an American underground missile base for a comparison). The R-n-R 
Ru'un are programmed to serve, entertain, and help soldiers and space 
pilots relax. They cannot provide information (that a Tsolyani could 
understoand), and they do NOT offer technology, weapons, or the like. 
As for the language, Craig neglected to mention to Brett and his 
party that the Ru'uns' lips do not move in sync with the Tsolyani 
words they seem to be uttering. They use a form of "technological 
telepathy." The base dates not from the Latter Times (it was known 
but not used -- after all nobody who got there could get off without 
identification and authorisation, and few of the ancient military ID 
cards were available -- and they had the wrong pictures, dates, 
eye-prints, etc.  The Lords of the Latter Times at first tried to 
move a couple of the sophisticated pleasure robots to their own 
installations, but this kind of meddling is resisted with force by 
the island "brain centre," and these attempts failed or led to disaster. 

By the bye, do most of you know about the "little golden translation 
balls?"  These are highly treasured by players in my games. They are 
creations of the early (and more technological Latter Times) and are 
found here and there in ancient installations. They are about the 
size of a small marble and are made of golden metal. Put one inside 
your cheek, and it connects with your brain waves to translate 
audible foreign speech into your own tongue -- and your words into 
something understandable by your hearers. They won't work on Ru'un, 
Yeleth, or the nonhuman languages, but they are very useful for most 
modern human languages. You can thus "speak" to a person whose 
language you don't know at all. They work by some sort of gimmicky 
computer chip circuitry, I suppose. They do short out or go dead -- 
rarely harming the user -- but they are extremely useful for long 
distance travellers. They are bulky in one's cheek, however, and I 
have known persons to swallow one accidently -- and then have to wait 
for its eventual emergence...

If you don't have one of these "golden balls," You can spend months 
learning a foreign language, which would slow the game down greatly. 
On "real Tekumel" the golden balls are quite rare and do require some 
configuration for various languages, but it's better to keep it simple 
for players in the games.

Hope this helps!

Phil

The Serudla is described in the "Tekumel Bestiary" as being covered 
with grey-green iridescent scales. The colour is deeper and more grey 
on top and lighter and with a distinctive greenish tinge on the belly, 
throat, and under-limbs.  There are variations: from really dark grey 
to fairly pale, cloud- or mist-grey.  The Tsolyani peasants name the 
Serudla "the Pale Murderer." The reason for this choice of name is not 
known. This species mostly lives in low mountains and forested regions. 
I recall well the player who started a character in Jakalla and was 
expecting to meet a Serudla just outside the city limits! Rather like 
those benighted types who expect to see bears in Minneapolis suburbs 
-- and sometimes do...

It is the Ghatoni who have some secret method of domesticating the 
Serudla enough to use it as a battle-beast.

The Sro is darker, ranging to charcoal and black above, with a lighter 
grey or blue-grey underbelly. The scales are iridescent, shining with 
bluish lights.  The eyes are sometimes rimmed with blue-black or 
purplish-blue-grey scales that lend them a luminous, malevolent look. 
They are not particularly aggressive, however, and may even help humans 
who are under attack from other, still more inimical species. The Sro 
lives in the high mountain ranges in remote areas of the continent. 
They are not very numerous, and few have seen them.

As far as I know, the Sro has never been domesticated or used in 
battle, although it is intelligent enough to use weapons (huge bronze 
or steel swords -- supplied by species like the Hluss, who enjoy 
causing humankind as much fear and grief as possible. If you're in 
Jakalla, you can see examples of these swords in the Governor's arms 
collection -- it's open to the public on certain days. Right now, 
though, Jakalla is a good place to stay *away from*: the civil war 
has mostly passed over it, but there are food riots and unrest.

These two creatures are probably genetically related. They originate 
on one (or two?) of the Shen worlds and were brought to Tekumel to 
adorn some ancient spacefarer's private zoo. When the Time of Darkness 
came, they escaped and sought habitats suitable for their species. 
They now find Shenyu and Mmatugual inhospitable -- too hot to suit 
them. They thus seem to have wandered north to Ghaton and the N'luss 
area, over across Yan Kor and the Lorun regions to the small states of 
the far northeast, and down into some of the mountain ranges in northern 
Tsolyanu. Both Sro and Serudla have recently been reported in the 
eastern empire: in Kerunan, near Ru, the Hundranu Rise, and up towards 
Fenul.

These creatures are neither pets nor playthings. The last Tsolyani who 
tried to domesticate a Sro is still missing...

Take care!

Phil
