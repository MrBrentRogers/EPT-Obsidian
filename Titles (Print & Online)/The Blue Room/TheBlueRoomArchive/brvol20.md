These messages are the accumulation of the messages that were sent out on 
the Blue Room email list between May 1995 and June 2000.  A large portion 
of the information is directly from Professor M.A.R Barker. When the list 
members joined during the time the list was active, they agreed to refrain 
from sharing this data with non list members.  When the list ended, it was 
urged that the data be made available to non-list Tekumel fans, and it 
seemed like a good idea all around.

I only ask that if you download these digests, or have received them in 
some other way, please respect the agreements the list members made, and 
refrain from passing them around and instead point people to the Tekumel 
web site, www.tekumel.com so that they can download them for themselves, 
and see all the other material available on the Tekumel.com web site.

Many Thanks.

[                   section to his Tekumel Web Site.  Thanks Peter!        ]

Ohe !  At last !

I'm happy to announce that a new section of the 'Tekumel: The World of the
Petal Throne' site has been completed.

It's a description of the ten major 'Gods' and their Cohorts, along with
new renditions of their emblems. Choose a link below to take you to the
site.

I'm taking a break (a seven week trip to India), so they'll be no new
updates until mid January. Hopefully the trip will also inspire some new
visuals for the site, and I'll probably be using some photographic source
material from the trip also!

As usual, all comments, contributions, constructive criticism and/or
effusive praise are greatly welcomed. There's an email link at the bottom
of every page.

Best regards, and a happy and safe Xmas and New Year,
Peter Gifford

[James Eckman writes...]

There have been many cultures that have decided for the majority of their
members that it's better to be a dead traditionalist than a live innovator.
Some of the Amerindian tribes made those types of decisions. The survivors
of these tribes would be considered misfits and outcasts to the older tribal
customs. Hitler and his bad boys kept fighting a clearly lost war even
though it would devastate their own country. People and cultures are not
rational, faced with a large influx of innovation minded, western techie
outlook type people, Tsolyanu might have a real problem. But they don't,
because this outlook doesn't exist in any vast scale on Tekumel. Basically
accept the Professor's premises is what I would suggest.

[Patrick Brady writes...]
A thought about gunpowder and magic.
Magic isn't sufficiently rare on Tekumel to be very threatened by 
even fairly advanced gunpowder. Frankly, Tsolyani sorcery would 
probably be more effective against a 16th century musketeer line or 
even 18th century artillery than it is against the present enemies 
of the Empire.

Hostile sorcery would make handling black powder a form of suicide. 
Given the interest the Temple of Vimuhla has in pyrotechnics and the 
availability of relatively low level telekinetic spells, it would be 
a brave man or a fool who wandered the battlefield festooned with 
quantities of black powder. With spells that create water, wind and 
fire anything from before the sealed cartridge would be much less 
useful than it may first appear. Standing next to a muzzle loading 
cannon, and the piles of gunpowder barrels they required to service 
them, would not be a significant contribution to your personal glory 
or lifespan.

Given the relatively widespread use of spells of warding, it would 
not be possible to shatter infantry lines at range with gunfire in 
set piece battles. At least with arrows something big and sharp will
fall (slowly) through the warding. It seems to me that you need 
the sorcerers at least as much as a defense as an offence, without 
them it would take a great technological improvement to avoid 
suffering huge losses. And if you must have them for defence...
Hauling carts: Even if you could do it on the Sakbe, you would have 
no chance on even moderately rough ground. A horse produces a lot 
more power and traction than a human. Anything capable of similar 
would no longer be describable as a human.

Actually the situation on Tekumel always strikes me as horrifyingly 
plausible. Once you understand its precepts, the axioms just roll 
into place :-) The Professor has written new rules, that is really 
what makes it so much fun.
Regards, Patrick

[Sean Boomer writes...]

Hi there!  I'm a little new to this game system, but a couple of things
strike me about Gordon's comments about gunpowder and spells.  First of
all, regarding gunpowder.  It does not follow that just because a high
ranking scholar makes an exploding powder someone will think up a
musket-like device to accompany it.  The Chinese DID put gunpowder to
military use, but primarily to confuse and disrupt enemy lines
(firecrackers).  In hindight I don't see any reason for them to have
thought of anything else.  I know that nothing like the musket would have
occurred to me if I had never heard of the concept.  It was probably
serendipity that led to the invention of cannon, and from this the musket.
 Secondly - wouldn't powerful magical interests move in to block any mass
use of spells (or gunpowder) by the common field soldier?  After all, a lot
of powerful wizards would lose out on a great source of wealth and prestige
(serving as magical battlefield support).
I think it would be a very brave general who would risk the wrath of
powerful sorcerers. 

Cheers,

Sean

Yes, I have seen the moview you mention -- and did not notice the
inscription on the gong-beaer's headdress. That is not unusual for me -- I
am as blind as a Hu-bat or worse.

Tekumel has been utilised in various ways by various people. Tekumel-like
armour, swords, and costumes are common on miniature lead "wargaming"
figures. I have a dozen from various manufacturers myself, though I don't
recall seeing any lately that might still be available. A few people have
borrowed the Tekumel mythos for their own fiction, with never a kind word
for its creator. Really, this is of little importance to me -- a
money-grubber I am not. Indeed, if I had to live on the proceeds from
Tekumel, I would very soon be as starved as any fleshless Shedra!

Anybody write them down? I'm just curious. Maybe the designer tried to make
a joke in English using Tsolyani characters? I've had several people write
to me in English using Tsolyani script -- and even one or two who struggled
personfully to write real Tsolyani. I'll never forget how I got my first
lead miniature Urunen: I saw an ad in a British wargaming magazin for a
species called something like "Sons of Satan" (?). The picture with the ad
was so familiar tht I went to my picture file and hunted through it. Sure
enough, there it was, dating from the 1940's or earlu 1950's, marked
"Urunen," My notes said these creatures are South Pole dwellers. I wrote
away at once to the figure manufacturer -- and soon received a reply in
*Tsolyani*! You can imagine the stunned shock...! It turned out that the
figure-designer had a longstanding love for Tekumel.

Do influences *really* creep through the "Skin of Reality" from the Planes
Beyond? I am too cynical to say yes, but ...

Who knows? Bey Su and Avanthar may really be "just around the corner."

The first day of the new Mayan baktun (namely 13.0.0.0.0, 4 Ahau 3 Kankin)
will be Saturday, 22nd December 2012 A.D./8th Safar 1434 A.H. Perhaps the

he'd "translated" the year from 1434 A.H. to 2012/2013 A.D. for the

You are quite correct in your assessment of the weight of weapons. I have
samples of all sorts of ancient, mediaeval, and oriental weapons right here
in my house, and some of them are just plain *strange.* The heaviest swords
I have are two-handed flamberges (the Swiss Landsknecht sword). These
weight 11 and 12 pounds, respectively, and because of their balance, I defy
even Arnie Schwarzenneger to wield wield them agilely. They were used, I
have read, in mixed phalanxes of Spanish short-swordsmen, 2-handed
swordsmen, and pikemen in the rear with pike points over the shoulders of
their comrades ahead of them. This "hedgehog" made the Swiss almost
unbeatable in late-mediaevaL Europe. I also have much lighter Indian
weapons that defy anybody to use them: highly curved, blade-heavy
scimitars, a left-handed dagger with 2 blades and a handle nobody in the
West can get a fighting grip on, etc. etc.

Chris has the correct answer, below. The very elaborate swords, halberds,
etc. are largely ceremonial. The Tsolyani do not seem to have favoured a
straight sword -- even their combat swords are curved and may have a sharp
back-point or two. One of the arts taught by the sword-masters in the
academies is the use of these barbs and extra points to catch an opponent;s
armour or shield and pull him/her off balance so that one's comrades in the
battle line can put quietus to him. This fighting style works best with
massed phalanxes, but even individually, a Tsolyani swordsman may attempt
to catch his opponent with his blade and drag him offguard. Some prefer to
add a sharp little "main gauche" (left-hand dagger) as well to make sure
the fellow doesn't somehow get in a blow.

Chlen-hide weapons are a little more flexible, as well as easier to shape
and decorate.

Absolutely. One cannot drag a hooked and barbed Tsolyani sword out of a
scabbard in any reasonable time. The little belt clip works much better.

----------

[Dwight's Comments....]

In John Smith's letter, the subject of the stylized polearms being unweildly
came up. If memory serves me European and asian Polearms were frequently very
elaborate with multiple barbs, hooks, and blades. Now this may seem to make a
weapon unweildly, but it isn't true. These weapons were designed to disarm,
snag up or break other weapons. I'm sure any soldier on Tekumel would tell
you the same thing! 

Furthermore, there were whole schools, both in Asia and Europe dedicated to
learning the art of the polearm. Consider for a moment: Feinting with a
polearm and following it up with a viscious kick to your opponent's knee or
groin. Perhaps a bit crude, but there are illustrations from European weapons
manuals illustrating the selfsame manouver. Polearms are far from clumsy
weapons. A friend of mine in the SCA was demonstrating how a halberd could be
used one handed in case of the loss of one of your arms in battle. My friend
also pointed out that Polearm users in the Society are not allowed to swing
their weapons overhead at more than a 90 degree arc... as it has a nasty
tendency to break bones even when padded! 

There was also an article in one of the old Imperial Couriers about how and
why the weapons of Tekumel are used. The concept of drawcuts and snagging and
binding weapons was mentioned in I believe. Bear in mind also that the Swiss
beat the dogsnot out of the Germans at the battle of Sempach with halberds,
and that the Landschnekts were masters of polearms as well.... In short
Polearms don't nearly get the credit that they deserve in most cases, when in
fact they form the backbone of all armies, Ancient Terran or Tekumelyani. 

Sincerely, 

Dwight Grosso

[Moderator's Note:  Peter Timko responds a bit more on the subject of Ditlana.]

[                  computer gets in and is working.  Sorry for the delay.     ]

Companions of the Blue Room:

Many thanks to Imel HiKetkolel for his response to my message 
concerning ditlana. It was this type of response precisely I sought 
by remarking of "dialectics." I conferred with the Tsolyani
acquaintance who had suggested view of ditlana to me, and he gave one 
of his chilling laughs before offering the following response, which 
I hope I have done justice with my translation. (He's an unusual man, 
an almost mystical follower of Chiteng, reputed to be quite adept at 
both killing and healing,...)

Bakheel HiSheschel of the Black Hood Clan, alchemist and 
follower of Chiteng, resident of Fasiltum, replies to Imel HiKetkolel 
of the Clan of the Purple Gem, a priest in the temple of Karakan and 
rusala to the 5th Imperial Heavy Infantry, and his discussion of 
ditlana.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

While I am able, with great difficulty, to pronounce the name of "Orson
Welles", I am quite unable to agree with his thesis that times of
instability promote great artists and men of letters.  The period of
greatest artistic and literary achievement in my civilisation occurred
during an era known as Engsvlan Hla Ganga, a golden age in which Stability
held sway over a vast area for a considerable time.  Cultures noted for a
love of bloodshed, such as the Nluss, or for political division, such as
the Milumanayani or the natives of Haida Pakala, have produced little of
merit.

    While we may argue about particulars of the history of Engsvan 
Hla Ganga, noble Imel HiKetkolel and I would surely agree that we 
know comparatively little -- and our temples would disagree about 
almost all of that. From a great distance, a fire appears to be a 
single light which, although it may flicker somewhat, does not change 
size or shape overmuch, so that one may indeed call it stable. Yet 
for one who sees the fire (or is consumed by it), the picture is very 
different. Which view is the more accurate? From this distance of 
time _you_ claim that Stabilith held sway during the greatness of the 
Priestkings' era. I demur from that view. As someone who knows 
both Haida Pakala and Tsolyanu intimately well, in terms of 
political division it seems that the main difference between 
the two is that the stakes are higher in the latter, and the 
den-den board has on it many more blues and blacks. Anyway, even the 
mighty Engsvan Hla Ganga not only fell, but disappeared beneath the 
waves. Stability?

I agree with HiTimko that ditlana cleanses excessive architectural 
growths from cities and I feel that there is considerable merit in his 
idea that this cleansing extends to the reduction of excessive 
political and factional growths as well.  There is a similarity here 
with the consecration of warriors, in which youths put aside the 
diversions of childhood, and with the rites associated with joining a 
legion or temple, in which an adult discards the encumbrances of 
civilian life.  These life events may be seen as ditlana on a personal 
scale.  Only by discarding the inessential can we steel ourselves and 
find the necessary focus that vigorous noble action requires.  Ditlana 
serves a similar life-event role in a city's skein of destiny. 

    Ah, yes, indeed. Yet, while this is Lord Karakan's view of 
things, the colors of the weaver's skein penetrate more deeply and 
more finally (with red the brightest, of course). Warriors are 
consecrated only superficially in ceremonies, but fully when covered 
in blood -- their own or that of the enemy, or both. In HiKetkolel's 
analogy, moving the essential items out of a clan house to be razed 
in a ditlana is akin to the rites he speaks of: ditlana on the clan 
scale. But at the scale of the city, the ditlana -- the RENEWAL -- 
consists in the levelling and RAZING { :) } of those buildings not 
destined to survive. Each legion, each cohort, is renewed not upon 
the parade stand, but through attrition in battle. So is a city.

I must take issue with HiTimko's theological contention that ditlana seems
not to fit well into the weltanschauung of those who serve Stability.
HiTimko remarks, quite perceptively for a barbarian from a realm barren of
magic and ignorant of the Gods, that ditlana serves a time marking
function.  I can think of few better metaphors for Stability than the
ticking of a clock. From a social perspective, without the periodic 
re-starting of civic affairs through ditlana, major Change of a slow 
incremental character would develop in directions that are 
unguessable.  This "progress", as I think Terrans call it, is the very 
antithesis of Stability and ditlana is one of the institutions by 
which progress is suppressed and Stability maintained.

    The Terrans, I have heard, often mistake "process" for "progress," 
implying that all change is directed (implying order, hence 
Stability). Butrus HiTimko may have made that mistake. 
Congratulations to the Temple of Karakan and Imel HiKaltkolel for 
putting "time marking" into the box of Stability. Yet, as it does not 
belong there, it will not stay. When any Jakallani can say, 'My clan 
house was built after the passage of Emperor Hirkane, "The Stone Upon 
Whom the Universe Rests,"' what his mind knows is that there is a 
time when the clan house was NOT there, but now IS. This is a 
hallmark of Change, albeit of a very minor sort.

It is often thought that any form of destruction serves Change.  Not so!
We at the temple of Karakan are quite comfortable with the idea of
supporting Stability through selective destruction.  Ditlana is an
excellent example of selective destruction in the interest of Stability.

    {A gale of dark laughter.} Lord Karakan's priests prattle about 
battle as if it is something predictable, can be controlled. (This 
seems to have been the case of one Terran general with the weird name 
of "Robert McNamara.") Destruction is a _process_ which, once begun, 
cannot necessarily be controlled. The historical notes on past 
ditlana ceremonies, such as I have seen, inevitably note a case in 
which buildings that were to be preserved have their foundations 
undermined and collapse. The poor engineers are faulted for this, as 
if Change, once begun, is subject to control by Stability.

HiTimko speculates that failure to observe ditlana in the last 800 years
has caused the present unpleasantness in Tsolyani political affairs. 
While I am unable to comment on the analysis by which he reaches this
conclusion, since it involves consideration of "progressive" development
in the absence of ditlana and that is a mode of historical study that I am
unfamiliar with, I feel that his conclusion is correct.  The Gods weave
the skeins of imperial destinies and there is a strong whiff of Divine
Retribution in the succession crisis.  We know that failure to do ditlana
does not please the Gods!

"Progressive?" Not at all. A man who simply eats and excretes without 
movement will die. A chlen beast will suffer and perhaps die if its 
hide is never pealed. Process has no necessary relation to progress. 
Exercise for the man and pealing for the chlen are processes that 
result in health, but no "progress." Change or have one's skein cut 
most short by the weaver. It is instructive to note that the body of 
a fresh corpse is a heavy weight, but flexible, changeable. A body 
dead for some days is not only stiff and stable, it also stinks.

I disagree with his opinion that a stronger empire would not have such
factional opposition to Dich'une.  No empire, at any time, could tolerate
the theft of the Petal Throne by such illegitimate means.

    Noble Imel, had the Empire been stronger, a conniving 
vainglorious {more personal invective} like Dhich'une would never 
have been able to steal the throne. I humbly suggest that in a healthy 
empire, anyone strong enough create a one-person kolumejalim would be 
capable of holding the empire together.

Peter HiTimko sees a silver lining in the current political situation, in
that a war of succession will serve as a ditlana on an empire-wide scale. 
I don't think that any analogy can be drawn between the random devastation
of civil war and the orderly elimination of ditlana.  I do, however, see
the prospect of a golden lining: if Eselne should ascend the throne with
Kettukal as his general and with all the vital forces of the empire
already mobilised for war, Yan Kor will be crushed and Livyanu will slip
from Mu'ugalavyani hands into ours with ease.  We would then be three
fifths of the way towards reuniting the five empires in a second Engsvlan
Hla Ganga.

    Of course a servant of Stability would create the oxymoronic 
concept of "orderly destruction" -- the obvious binary partner of 
"random devastation." One may perhaps note how prominent fire is as a 
weapon in civil war, fire the purifier {untranslatable monologue on 
the virtues of "uncontrolled destruction"}. Fire may not be 
predictable by those who care about prediction, but that does not 
quite mean that it is utterly random. Similarly, someone with 
Stability naivete about warfare may conclude that a unified and 
mobilised Tsolyanu would be able to conquer all after civil war. 
There is, of course, the problem of civil unrest is some areas and
probable heavy losses to many legions; the terrain of Yan Kor would 
require individual large garrisons in the cities to actually hold the 
place with supply lines running thousands of Tsan through non-
pacified territory; and while Livynau without Livyani might be 
manageable, I think the situation will not be so easy. In any case,
I doubt that between the two of them Prince Eselne and his pet 
general have the brains to effect noble Imel HiKetkolel's daydream.

I welcome this opportunity for dialogue with a Terran and I urge all
Terrans to get around to ditlana as soon as they can.  Clearly their
culture is deeply mired in the quicksands of progress. 

    Yes Terrans captive to progress, Stability captive to 
oversimplification through imposition of an ordered gestalt on a 
Changing world. The concept of the "dialectic" introduced to me by 
Butrus HiTimko is a way around these twin maladies, encaspulating 
at once as it does both being and becoming. Perhaps we can begin a 
dialectical process may result not only in Change, but perhaps even 
"flames."

I hadn't thought of this one.  Any anthropologists out there know whether this
game works in a culture with a strong oral tradition?  I would think people
would be better at repeating even long phrases verbatim if they weren't used to
depending on written communications.

(I'd assume Tsolyanu has a strong oral tradition, at least among the lower
 lasses, as published literacy rates for them are not high.)

Mm.  Historically, how bad a problem was this?  My guess is not terribly so --
that people who use this system take the bandwidth hit and transmit relatively
simple messages with a lot of effort rather than risking misinterpretation.

My research has found a document that may pertain to the current discussion
on the Cataclysm.  The document is in some strange unknown language with an 
attached summary in Ancient Tysolani quoted below:

"At the "Time of the Lost Planets", the known galaxy appeared to be cut 
in half  by a long line of  "lost planets".   This group of researchers have
found that a few of the Ancient's gates between worlds appear to be 
functioning and at great risk (step into a gate the wrong colour - is to be 
never seen again) we explored.  What was found was the "lost worlds" still 
exist in some type of bubble universe of just one sun, but many changes have
been wroth by the Cataclysm.  We have been able to visit some four of these
bubble universes so far and observed the strange civilisations that have 
developed.  We have seen the strange occurrence of new phenomena called 
"Magic" as well as the appearance of more psionic afflicted people. 
Technology as we know has disappeared although functioning items can be seen, 
but to purchase these is very expensive on all these worlds.

Races of our Galaxy appear to be represented on each of these worlds but on
some, strange new beasts/intelligent? lifeforms appears to have evolved, 
(or been developed ?), many we enchanted very unpleasant. 

Time also has changed, with dates of the Cataclysm quite different from that
recorded in what we now refer to as our home galaxy (which we hope one day
to return to with our interesting observations).  We will continue to search
for the next gate in the hope it will return us to our own galaxy and leave
this record should someone follow us, or someone from this world use the
gates and find themselves in our galaxy.  In the meantime we will continue
to try and find what caused the planets to disappear into these bubble
universes - we speculate some type of alien space drive system as the line 
of lost planets was very straight.

The attached document in Standard Galaxy details our travels to date, and 
thanks to our friend here for scribing this note for the local researchers 
to study.  We are leaving this record should any follow us from our Galaxy.

The accuracy of the above is suspect as the parchment is very old, although
the attached document is in perfect condition.

Maybe one day I can persuade the powers to be to allow me to explore further
the possibilities of other worlds trapped in bubble universes (whatever they
are??), if only I knew where one of those gates were.

Last night (04/11/97) there was an interesting programme on TV that

[                   one else does Day/Month/Year.  As Matthew is from the UK,]
[                   this means Nov 4, 1997.  I am not that far behind!  :)   ]
explored the culture of the Maya (Central American culture at its height
from about 400AD to 800AD) in light the work done on translating their
heiroglyphs.

The previous opinion of them had portrayed them as a scientifically
advanced, peaceful people. The translations disproved this, showing them
to be blood thirsty, constantly seeking to appease their gods with blood
sacrifice.

One or two things struck me with regard to Tekumel. I may not be
entirely accurate as I was tired and not taking notes ...

1. Firstly was the ideas behind the symbol for life and their symbol of
the cosmos. This was based upon their ideas of direction. Life came from
the East, West was the source of death and so on. In one aspect of this
symbol (which was cross shaped) was a road that ran from West to East,
from death to life, what they called the 'road of life' or 'Sakbe'.

You can imagine the bells going off in my head. Is this the source of
the roads accross Tsolyanu? In name at least, if not format.

2. The programme also showed a royal palace/temple complex that had half
of it torn away (literally cut in half) by a river. This exposed to the
archaeologists how the top building had been built upon over another and
so and so on, right back to the original temple/tomb. (Amazingly the
actual founder of the city/culture and first of a dynasty was unearthed.
It turns out that he was from central Mexico and a foreigner and was
always portrayed with circular eye pieces - the source for the whole
'Charriots of the Gods' idea ...)

Is this building over of tombs and the like, the souce of Ditlana?

In light of these two questions, I wondered just how much this culture
influenced that of Tekumel?

Actually, you don't get *nearly* as much distortion, as with the party
game because the message is sent one letter at a time. So while this
could result in a word being mispelled between two stations, the
structure of just about any language will result in the error being
obvious in most cases. 

As an example, the equivalent "party game" would be for you to write
down your message, then read ot to the next person one letter at a
time. They write it down as you read it. Then they repeat the process
with the next person. 

And in practice, after receiving a message (or section of message if
it's a big message) you send it back to the other station. If you got
it right, they just send back an "ok" signal. If it isn't, they send
you the correction.

If you give me a letter frequency table for Tsolyani (ie a list of
letters from most common to least common in "normal" text) I could do
up a "morse code" also.

And if you can use either magical light sources or bright (but small)
fires, you can even send messages at night. Not with mirrors, but by
masking and unmasking the fire. But the transmission rate will be a
*lot* slower (at least with fire where you have to make sure that
flickers aren't confused with deliberate maskings).

BTW, I figured out the big disadvantage of semaphores and heliographs.
Regardless of how hard you try to keep it secret, some people *will*
know the code, even if they have to figure it out by recording the
"code sequences" and then trying to compare them to likely message
texts. 

So you have to accept the idea that at least some of your messages will
be known. You *can* encrypt them, but that makes sending and receiving
them harder (you can't rely on the operators being able to
automatically correct simple errors from context (eg "Sakbe rofd" to
"Sakbe road")

Still, it'll be worth it in most cases. And I'm sure that Tekumeli
society can handle the situation of messages being "officially" secret
but actually know widely to those "in the know". Heck, that's a
*common* situation. As long as everyone *acts* as if they don't know
(regardless of what behind the scenes measures they take based on their
"forbidden" knowledge) then "face" is maintained and officials don't
have to "take notice" of the *real* situation.

:-)

ps. speaking of codes, I assume that the list is aware of the fact that
Tsolyani has a "code page" in the "official unofficial" Unicode
registry? I can dig up the URL and post the code assignments if anyone
is interested.

Actually, this is not the real problem for words sent this way, 
although for numbers it is. In transmissions data loss is based on 
the unit of communication. In the case of the chinese whispers the 
unit is the word and so it is words that get mangled. In most 
semaphore systems the unit is an individual character and this allows 
for much better error checking by the operator who knows that the 
word "teh" is probably a miss-sending of "the" from the context.

   A real physical problem on Tekumel is heat haze. The stations 
would have to be closer together or bigger than in France to be sure 
of being seen. either way this means more cost, material, and upkeep. 
There is a further, more psychological/magical problem which I'll 
mention below on the subject of Heliographs.

  By the way, did you know that the fax machine was introduced into 
France in the late 1800's? A British invention, no one would back the 
inventor here so he went across the Channel and set up the first 
system from Lille to Paris (I think). This sort of thing points up 
the differences between our world & Tekumel's for sheer pace of 
invention.

Tell that to the Incas who had an empire almost as long (N-S) as

In a world of mind powers it is too easy to find the keys to codes 
for messages which can be seen by anyone who wants to. At least if 
the message is secret having the key to any code is only half the

The Ssu and Hluss are localised on Tekumel. They seem to have had
rudimentary spaceflight within their own system, but some scholars doubt
even that. There are plenty of "nasties," though, on other planets. Some
species are indeed confined to their home worlds, while others either
developed low-level spaceflight or else were transported here and there.
Various species were imported to Tekumel as zoological exhibits, specimens,
etc. -- and when the Cataclysm came, many died while others excaped to
adapt to Tekumel.

[Moderator's Note:  More technology on Tekumel from James Snead.            ]

Another remark on technology and Tekumel; one element which should be
emphasized here is the role of "prestige" in the adoption of technological
items.  It has been demonstrated that chlen hide weapons are effective and
cheap, while bronze is heavy and expensive; the desirability of bronze for
certain parties seems to be more closely associated with the status of the
weapons, perhaps since those in circulation are often of some antiquity.
In a conservative tradition, such equipment would display a
tangible association with noble traditions of the past, thereby increasing
the status of its owner.  Bronze isn't "better", technologically speaking,
but the prestige conferred by wielding an Engsvanyali sword would be
coveted by those who could afford it.

There are numerous examples of this behavior in human prehistory.  Native
American cultures in contact with euro-americans in the 18th and 19th
centuries often designed clubs which looked like gun stocks; guns
themselves were prestigous, and if you didn't have one, you might as well
fight with something that looked like one.  Swords buried in bronze-age
barrows in northern Europe were much harder to obtain than spears, and by
placing them with the deceased owner were thus removed from use; the
prestige they conferred was more valuable than their efficiency, since
otherwise the leader might have passed it on to his descendants.

Value is thus a culturally-relative term.  While efficiency is central
to the euro-american ideal of progress, prestige is often of greater
importance in non-european traditions, which the status-conscious
societies of Tekumel more closely resemble.

The system is less structured than the 17th-19th Century British structure.
As far as I know, it is clan membership -- and lineage status within the
clan -- that gets one a fancy military post. Personal charisma plays some
part, too, as do occasional real gifts and/or favours to important
officials and army officers. After all, if the relevant Molkar or Dritlan
is a fellow clan member and belongs to the same or a related lineage, and
if he/she has been gifted with a parcel of nice land and some mercantile
privileges, one can logically expect that one's offspring will be welcomed
into the officer's legion. Not to admit the kid would be impolite...

Headquarters staffs differ from legion to legion, sometimes due to an
individual general's preferences, sometimes to tradition, etc. Usually
about 100-500 elite guards are employed to protect the general's tent;
50-100 scribes, servants, Aide-de-camps, etc. will form the general's
official support stamff; there will be a messhall staff of about 50-75;
adjunct, liaison, and supply officers whose numbers change almost every
day, and numbers of hangers-on, concubines, whores, entertainers, and the
whole Imperial dog-and-pony ("Renyu-lel-Chlen"?) show. It is very hard to
be precise since these entourages differ so much. One of the high priests
of Lord Hnalla was constantly attended by about 700 people whenever he left
his temple's premises. He even had a choir of singers, poets, and musicians
who sat below his dais in his bedroom and recorded even his most intimate
acts in words of glowing praise. What his various bedmates thought about
this is not recorded.

None that I know of. I'll check my files when I get a chance. The legion is
supporting Eselne and is the backbone of his battle-line down near Mrelu.
Gamalu has quietly put it about that Prince Eselne will make him High
Chancellor in Avanthar, once the Civil War is won.

In regards to the points made by Messers Brady and Boomer:

        BOTH of you contrived to miss my point ENTIRELY!

        Who CARES about gunpowder, as such? Even if you had it, what are
you going to make the musket-barrels from-- bamboo?!
        I only mentioned it because of WHY it became so widely used, not
HOW; it didn't require years and years of intensive schooling just to make
it fizzle slightly, never mind going 'boom'-- 
        THAT was the point!

        Grrr... Still, given this Basic Mistake, you made some good points;
I sure wouldn't enjoy hefting sacks of powder around, knowing that
'fire-sparking' is something a jack-priest of Vimuhla can do by -sneezing-
wrong... And I have no doubt that attempts to use fifteenth-century
musketeers would, indeed, encounter the singular problems mentioned.

[Moderator's Note:  Me either!]
	
        As to your comment about horses producing more power and traction--
ever been at the losing end of a tug-of-war? You get enough people, you can
drag any horse.
        (Besides, 'not describable as human' was precisely what I was
thinking anyway. These would be extremely similar to -gorillas-, in their
build, their strength and their intelligence.)

[Moderator's Note:  As Patrick pointed out.  Hauling a cart with a long   ]
[                   line of Gorilla-like humanoids would probably work on ]
[                   a Sakbe road, it probably wouldn't work in any kind of]
[                   terrain.  Even with a moderate line of Gorilla-men    ]
[                   would be difficult in terrain.  (IMHO)                ]

        Now, Sean Boomer did point out something interesting.
        "Wouldn't powerful magical interests move in to block any mass use
of spells (or gunpowder) by the common field soldier?" Which interests are
these? The ones still clutching their half-read scrolls, staring at
soldiers' pikes? 

        Seriously, though, you may have an extremely good point. The idea
of an entire cohort (I was being a bit ambitious, saying 'Legion' earlier)
chanting out their rote-learned 'kill' spell is all very well, IF that was
how battles were fought.

[Moderator's Note:  Major problem here is that Magic use requires high levels]
[                   of intelligence, Psychic Ability, and Resevoir.  This    ]
[                   combination is apparently not found often.  I don't think]
[                   most foot soldiers have the requisite ability to pop off ]
[                   doomkills.  Even if they could learn the spell.  What is ]
[                   worse, consider the average grunt, starting his doomkill ]
[                   (along with a dozen of his buddies) and they get a bit   ]
[                   excited, or some arrows fall into their ranks, right at  ]
[                   the time the spell is forming.  Kaboom, there goes your  ]
[                   army!  Decimated by your own doomkills.  At least the    ]
[                   enemy appreciated the pretty light show and sends you    ]
[                   scampering back to your homes instead of taking you      ]
[                   prisoner.  (Also, who wants 8000 people knowing doomkill ]
[                   spells scampering about after they muster out?  Not Me!  ]
[                   If you could remove the ability after they retire, that  ]
[                   would be more preferable, but costly and time consuming. ]

        It's not. Further, given the entire 'little war' concept, even IF
some priest, perhaps a renegade, were willing to teach the spell, it is
indeed unlikely that a General would LET him.
        "It's just not DONE, you know, old boy. It's -not cricket-."
        (In hindsight, during any Presidential address of Congress it would
have been not only possible but very easy for a 'suicide bomber' to have
taken out President Lincoln AND the entire Congressional leadership at one
stroke, doing incalculable damage to the Union war-fighting ability during
the American Civil War.
        Fine: Imagine even -suggesting- such a tactic to a Confederate
General. You would be regarded as hopelessly mad-- or worse. A more
shameful, ignoble, horrendous act they could not imagine. They'd step on
you like a bug, taking you for one.)

        The idea, that just because you -can- do something does not mean
that you -ought-, brings me to Mr Eckman's comments. Somehow I can hear
Dinah Shore singing, "East is East, and West is West / And the wrong one I
have chose..."

        There are only two observations I can make to his statements: Even
in the most hide-bound cultures, people themselves aren't stupid; they -do-
think, they do figure things out, and while in the West, the rationale for
building that better mousetrap has been to enrich the inventor, it's also
perfectly possible-- and a great many astounding examples exist-- to do
something equally brilliant merely 'for the greater glory of God.'

[Moderator's Note:  But, if that mousetrap steps on the toes of a clan that ]
[                   has provided mousetraps for centuries, and has ears in  ]
[                   high places, it may mean that you get squashed like the ]
[                   bug you mentioned above.  On Tekumel, tradition seems to]
[                   roll on like a huge boulder, sometimes squashing inno-  ]
[                   vations that would help people as well as those that    ]
[                   wouldn't or don't matter.                               ]

        If it also fills the coffers of your Temple, well, hey... 

[Moderator's Note:  If it filled the Temple coffers, they would probably    ]
[                   work out a way to help you.  Incentives, you know!  :)  ]
[                   My guess is that you clan-master would try to approach  ]
[                   the other and work out some type of cross-trade, with   ]
[                   your mousetrap as a significant trading item. It might  ]
[                   even result in some type of business merger.  You may   ]
[                   find yourself on that clan's mousetrap design team!     ]

        The other point is a bit more prosaic: The campaign wherein that
originated -did- have 'western techie outlook type people' in it-- the
ship's complement of a small scoutcraft that accidentally entered the
Tuleng system, and was basically stranded there.
        These guys had to make a living some way...

        ("Basically accept the Professor's premises is what I would
suggest." I have all along, thank you, to the very extent that I -should-.
Your character isn't mentioned in any of his writings, is he? So in
creating that character, by definition you've stepped outside those

"Anybody write them down? I'm just curious. Maybe the designer tried to make
a joke in English using Tsolyani characters?"

        No, it's nothing that lengthy-- nor that specific. It's only six,
maybe eight characters, and after close examination with EPT rules in hand,
I'm starting to think that they're a Hyksos 'cartouche'-- a meaningless
scrawl that LOOKS extremely authentic, at any rate...
        In short, I've yet to make an exact match, but even the most casual
inspection would ring a bell instantly-- as indeed it did. (Artistic
license, undoubtedly. The script's appearance is part of the 'Tekumel
look,' so the designer hummed a bar and faked the rest.)

        But you DID see the movie? I'd have liked to have heard your first
impressions of that concluding 'Vulcan Temple' scene. From the first
establishing shot onwards was like the 'Swords and Glory' cover art

the first time that you, The Man Himself, replied to a comment that I had
made. Me. After twenty-two years, actual -response-, interaction-- had my
Tactical Studies Rules book from 1975 abruptly spoken out loud I could have
been no more floored.

know why the cover art on those 1975 EPT rules is signed 'P.B.' I'd have
certainly never guessed 'Phil'...)

Here's another, slightly different, possible explanation for how the
drive might work, based on the idea that the "three-light" bit may not
be meant entirely literally.

As we know, "light" is just electromagnetic radiation, within a
relatively narrow band of the entire spectrum.  It seems to me that if
an entity from an advanced technological race, who had a good
understanding of electromagnetism and saw its different manifestations
as variations of the same form of energy, were trying to describe, say,
radio waves or x-rays, to someone without any foundation in the (modern
or futuristic) sciences, said entity might well describe different
electromagnetic radiations as different kinds of "light."

Perhaps the drive uses (or emits) radiation of three specific
wavelengths when it is used to propel spacecraft or whatever at
faster-than-light speeds.  The wavelengths might vary according to some
arcane method of drive calibration, or might relate to the distance the
drive was meant to travel.

This is just meant to spark thought.  Honestly, I don't need to know how
the Three Light Drive *really* works... it's more interesting if kept
mysterious.

>[Stephen Foster adds...]

The Ssu may or may not have been the native life form on Tekumel,
although those present when the Human-Pe Choi empire bumped into them
certainly believed they were.  Possibly existing theories of evolution
simply did not take into account so energetic a solar system, where the
extreme amounts of solar energy stimulated the early development of life
on its planets.

Certain scholars, whose theories were widely ridiculed before Tekumel
fell into its own spacetime, believed that life was inevitable on any
reasonably nonhomogeouns planetary system, given the continual input of
solar energy and sufficient chemical building blocks.  Under their
theories, life could evolve rapidly following the formation of planetary
bodies meeting the basic requirements.

Tekumel, at the time of its discovery by humans, was covered in a thick
gaseous soup rich with amino acids  which offered plenty of biochemical
building blocks, and shielded the surface from most of the lethal
radiation. 

While this combination of a ridiculously bright star and a dense
atmospheric blanket worked for the Ssu and the Hluss, it was useless as
an interstellar way station to the humans and Pe Choi.  To make the
planet usable, they needed to strip away the thick and corrosive
atmospheric blanket, but this of course would expose the surface to the
incinerating rays of Sinistra Nu Ophiuchi.  So they pared the star down
to a reasonable size.  The methods employed were fairly crude, and didn't
allow for fine adjustments once they'd gotten it into the upper end of
the G-class.

They expected these steps to destroy all life on Tekumel above the
bacterial level, but possibly this is where the evolutionary theories
failed to account for the rapid adaptive changes possible under a high
energy system.  Or the Ssu and the Hluss may have had genetic
technologies to adapt themselves and some native foods for survival.  Or
they may simply have been really, really tough.

The effect upon Ssu vision of these changes is apparent.  Some
Latter-Time estimates placed the amount of UV radiation at the surface of
the planet at about 1/3rd its cloudy pre-terraforming levels, meaning
that during the day the Ssu see things at what would have been twilight
levels of illumination, which might explain their comparatively large
eyes.  At night they carry UV lights which are visible to humans as dim
blue lanterns.

[                   and use.                                                ]

This is a belated reply to Dwight Grosso's comments about weapon design in
message # 576.

In my reading of history, SCA experience and gaming of Tekumelian battles,
polearms certainly work for individuals and groups.  There is no doubt that 
they can chop, jab or cut with great force and superior reach.  Greek,  
Macedonian, Swiss and Spanish spear and pike formations won-or helped to 
win-a host of engagements.  Certainly, many other armies relied on the 
spear as well.

However, the combination of polearms with other melee weapons, flexible drill,
initiative and combined-arms tactics defeated all of the phalanxes mentioned.  
The shortsword, and the excellent training used by the legions of the Roman 
Republic, countered spear and pike in the decisive battles of Ilipa, Zama, 
Cynocephalae, Magnesia and Pydna.  All of the above engagements included the 
greater battlefield initiative possible when using  sword-and-shield.  
Scipio Africanus' leadership obviously helped in the first two conflicts, 
but more typical Roman commanders destroyed the Macedonian and Seleucid 
armies in the latter three.  In all five, spear and pike units were not able 
to protect their flanks against swordsmen - especially when a phalanx was 
advancing victoriously, as at Cynocephalae.

As for the Swiss and the Spanish, field fortifications, slow, inefficient
matchlock firearms, good (i.e. controllable) cavalry and combined arms 
tactics defeated their pike formations.  The Swiss and Spanish leaders 
(when the former had any) refused to adapt their very successful methods 
to changing circumstances.  Those leaders did not have claim to an 
Ever-Glorious method of war like that of Tekumel.

Even in a world like Tekumel, where most units are armed with some kind of
spear, pike or polearm: the Warhammer units primarily are not.  Some Ahoggya 
use a spear or two, but a variation of the sword, axe or mace predominates 
with them, the Shen and the N'luss.  Pikes and spears may form the structure 
of an army formation, but Warhammer units break it- with the combined action 
of their entire force.

Do not forget the priesthoods!  Think of all the litanies and rituals 
they must commit to memory.  To give a Terra example, in India the 
Brahmins developed a complex system of mnemonics that allowed them to 
memorise the Vedas without error.  This involved memorising a second 
text of nonsense sylables that acted as a key to the real text so that 
any errors would be immediately noticed and corrected.  This system is 
still in use today, as attested by my old Hinduism professor at Indiana 
University.

Another example is that many Muslims will memorise the entire Koran, a 
book about the length of the New Testament.  I have also heard that in 
Shakespears day it would not be unusual for someone in the audience to 
remember the entire play they had just seen.

Point is that even without elaborate formal systems of mnemomics, human 
memory was and is often considered superior to the written record.  I am 
sure the Professor (and some of you others) is familiar with the 
scholarly technique of tracing the geneology of a manuscript by noting 
the errors on the texts.  In the Middle Ages a peasant boy would often 
be dragged in to witness a treaty or contract and then be given a good 
beating to make sure he remembered it for the rest of his life.

In short, the possibility of error in the semaphore system being 
proposed, while real, is not as great as many would think.

scheme would reduce the errors in semaphore transmission.

Not only that, you can also do "traffic analysis" even if you don't know the

up.  Combine it with the fact that two Legions just headed Northwest...

Possibly, but I don't think so. As I recall, the practice of building
new cities atop old ones is not singular to the Central or South
American civilizations; several such sites have been found throughout
the Middle East and Asia Minor. The most famous example of such a
city is probably that of Troy, a series of nine cities (at least)
built one atop the next.

In my opinion, there is no reason why building repeatedly on the
same site should be a function of a particular culture. There are 
usually good reasons to stay in the same place, often involving 
advantageous location (ease of defense/transportation, proximity to 
water sources, ease of agriculture, and the like) or simple inertia 
(why pick up and move somewhere else when you can stay where you are 
and build again).

>In light of these two questions, I wondered just how much this culture

Possibly a great deal. As I recall, many of the survivors of the
messes in 2012-3 were from Central and South America. While it
is true that a considerable period of time will have elapsed
between that age and that of Tekumel, I don't find it totally
inconceivable that certain cultural ideas would have remained
intact.

Simply, the horizon. You'd have to build either a small station every
few miles or a large (tall) station every few more miles. There's a
rough formula for determining the distance to the horizon, produced
below (courtesy of Steve Jackson Games' _GURPS Vehicles_):

Horizon = square root of [(D*1760*H) + (H*H)]

where D is the planet's diameter in miles (7915 for Earth) and H
is the sum of the observer's and the observed's height in yards
above the local base ground level. Thus, between towers 20 yards
tall, the value of H would be 40. Incidentally, using such towers
on earth would give a maximum range of just under 13.5 miles between
towers.

Don't forget the couriers, though. And don't run down the speed with
which the courier system operates; Incan emperors often had fresh fish

...which is where the couriers come in. You can intercept their
messages (mainly by ambushing the courier), but it's more difficult to
get the message out of them than it would be to simply read it from a
nearby tower.

This is actually not much of a problem.  If the enemy are not in a 
position to see the code, they will never know the code.  By placing a 
light source in a building/structure with thick walls and the light 
will be rather directional.  There are signal towers in Europe built 
with double walls (one inside of the other) with aligning holes to permit
light from a light source placed at the center of the tower to escape.
Since light does not bend, this focuses the signal light to an arc of a 
few degrees at most.  The towers themselves would have to be precisely 
placed, but I don't think that is a problem for the Tsolyani.

ancient civilization?

Tekumelani mostly have tremendous memories. They memorise all of the
thousands of verses to the various recensions of "The Lament to the Wheel
of Black," plus popular poetic works, plus other forms of literature --
etc. I recall when I was living in India that almost every literate person
I met could quote verses from several poets (ancient and modern) without
any difficulty, while I had endless trouble trying to memorise "To be or
not to be..." in highschool. I met little kids who could recite the entire
Qur'an (!) and quote you any verse you asked for. I also met kids who could
recite-sing the entire Ramayana of Tulsi Das in mediaeval Hindi. It's just
amazing.

People enjoy reciting poetry and singing the classical epics; hence there
is a very high degree of "memory ability" in the Five Empires.

The Tsolyani do wave banners and light fires (or send up an explosive
magical spell) to signal during battle. Semaphores, per se, have not
developed because of the Tekumelani attachment to their scripts: vowels are
written as diacritics over and under other letters; there are several forms
of the same letter, depending on its position in a word; etc. The Tsolyani
in particular cannot conceive of an alphabet where vowels are equal to
consonants and each has an on-the-line "letter" of its own. They say that
this would spoil the calligraphy and "anger the gods."

>Mm.  Historically, how bad a problem was this?  My guess is not terribly so --
>that people who use this system take the bandwidth hit and transmit relatively
>simple messages with a lot of effort rather than risking misinterpretation.

Sending simple messages with a banner or bright-coloured cloth is possible:
"Attack!" "Retreat!" "Return to camp!" The Five Empires do use trumpets and
drums to signal, too. The drum is not used to send something like Morse
code, however; different cadences indicate different messages. A sharp
tattoo of rata-rata-rata means "Advance!" to the Tsolyani; a shrill
continuous beat denotes "retreat," and other cadences have other meanings.

This may not help, of course, since many of us are sophisticated by
lifelong exposure to Western (American, British, European) tradition. We
*expect* such inventions, and if they are not present, we at once ask, "Why
not?" Our first impulse is to "invent" the missing item ("Now, General,
take this bundle of flags and raise them up high one at a time -- the red
equals 'attack,' the yellow means 'retreat," etc.) In point of fact, most
ancient and medaeval battle music was just to inspire the troops and make
loud and threatening noises to frighten the foe. A few signals were indeed
used. But there were quite complex societies that had musical instruments
but did not use them to send signals of any kind (e.g. the Aztecs, I
believe). Did the Romans invent/use semaphores? I know that they lit
bonfires atop hills and signal towers...

These questions are the most aggravating of trying to live within the
parameters of another culture.

Here we run into difficulties, alluded to in a previous post: the Tsolyani
do not conceive of vowels as "letters"; therefore, like Arabic, they tend
to write just consonants and sketch in a vowel or two to help the reading.
How do you then send a vowel letter? For example, you can send "s-k", but
this may be read as "saka," "suko," "Iska," etc. etc. This may still be
helpful, of course, if you use only a small number of known lexemes and
allow no others to be sent. It is not surprising, however, to find that
many, many other cultures of our world never invented anything similar,
even though it now seems so obvious to us!

Tekumelani heliographs? Another device that somehow got lost in
transmission out to Tekumel. Where is Archimedes when you need him?
Actually, the heliograph has been thought of, but the conservative military
doesn't approve -- "what," they ask, "Happens on a cloudy day -- or during
the rains, when so many battles occur?" They do use fires and lights to
signal simple messages, butcomplex material is beyond them.

You may be interested in an old story from one of the guides at the Red
Fort in Agra, India: he showed me a subterranean chamber where 7 doorways
had been bricked up. "Each of these," he said, "leads to a passage that
goes all the way underground from Agra to Delhi, to Benaras, to Lucknow, to
Gwalior, etc. A man standing here can bear a gong, and the noise will
reverberate down the tunnel for a long distance, where another relay
gong-beater can hear it, pick it up, and send it on to its destination."
Like all guides' stories, this may require a large ingestion of sodium
chloride -- but it's fun...

What are you going to do about the vowels and the various shapes of
individual letters? The Tsolyani will certainly not accept that "initial
/m/" is "the same letter" as "medial or final /m/," for example. In
reality, these are allographs of the same grapheme, determined by position
within the written word. But get any Tsolyani scholar to agree to this?

>>        You'd be surprised at how much information can be transmitted
>>between dawn and sunset, by those trained in its communication.

All true -- except that the Tsolyani, the Muugalavyani, the Yan Koryani,
and possibly the Livyani make somewhat hit-and-miss use of relays of
telepaths to send short, unambiguous (so far as possible) messages across
distances.

Quite right. But telepathy works at night, too. The problem is in finding
enough telepaths to communicate with everybody you need to talk to. Only a
very, very few people have that kind of talent.

An enemy can also interfere with the message: cast a few bright light
spells up in the air and add meaningless or *wrong* letters and words. If
your heliograph is located on a hill or a tower, you need only position
your magic-user out in front, between the source and the intended
recipients.

As noted in another posting, the Tsolyani (and others) tend not to see
their alphabets in terms of individual letters. Vowels are diacritics above
or below the consonant they follow. The various positional variants of the
consonants, too, are seen as "letters" and would take considerable
ingenuity to transmit.

Quite true. The Imperial messenger service regularly carries digets of new
laws, new facts, etc. across long distances.  Like the Inca with their
quipu (knotted coloured cords that stood for messages), the Tsolyani can
transmit new materials across the Empire by relay runner quite efficiently.
Nobody tends to think much farther than this -- it it ain't broken, don't
fix it.

Yes, quite right, assuming the culture did not have other priorities. The

and lobby in Avanthar.
