These messages are the accumulation of the messages that were sent out on 
the Blue Room email list between May 1995 and June 2000.  A large portion 
of the information is directly from Professor M.A.R Barker. When the list 
members joined during the time the list was active, they agreed to refrain 
from sharing this data with non list members.  When the list ended, it was 
urged that the data be made available to non-list Tekumel fans, and it 
seemed like a good idea all around.

I only ask that if you download these digests, or have received them in 
some other way, please respect the agreements the list members made, and 
refrain from passing them around and instead point people to the Tekumel 
web site, www.tekumel.com so that they can download them for themselves, 
and see all the other material available on the Tekumel.com web site.

Many Thanks.

Well, I think my point is hereby proved:  Alexander is talking about 
something *I* did, a coversation that he and I have already had, and I 
have no idea what he's talking about.  If it's possible for two such 
similar creatures as Alexander and I to be unable to communicate a 
shared experience in a mutually understandable fashion, it does not 
seem unlikely that two inimical and alien species would be simply 
unable to communicate at all.

Well, uh, inasmuch as Prof. Barker IS the 'source material', and 
inasmuch as he has said that the Ssu and Humans can't communicate, 
then what are we arguing about?

Announcements:  

I have finished my upgrade to Win NT and the ftp site should be working.  

Please check it out and let me know if you have any troubles.  I have checked
it out as well as I can on my end, and some have had minor troubles with it.

I have some good news!  Now that I am on NT, I will leave the ftp site running
during the day...  Ain't pre-emptive Multitasking wonderful!  I should be 
upgrading the server software to be NT native soon, too.

I have a new article to put in the articles directory.  It is the Temple of
Sarku, and listmember Floyd Brigdon provided it.  Thanks Floyd!  I am doing
the final checking of spelling, etc against the original tonight, so the 
article should be on the site tomorrow.

I have also received a new article by David Lemire on Hu'on, one of the 
Martial Arts of Tsolyanu.  The professor has seen it and has approved it
to go on the ftp site in the approved direcotry.  I will also send it out 
on the Blue Room, too, since it is fairly short, just shy of 3 pages.  I'll
send out a text only version on the list, if you want the fancy version, 
you can get it from the ftp site.

If any of you don't have ftp access, please let me know and I'll see what
I can do about providing alternate access.  I can probably even just mail
stuff out.  

About writing/transcribing articles.
David's article came complete with accent markings.  While this is nice, it 
does have some drawbacks.  I really need to have text, for numerous reasons,
I have a writing guide to create text documents with accent markers, so
that I can create the Word docs and .ps files that have the fully accented
characters.  Sadly, some of us don't have a way to read these, and I do send
text files out occasionally.  So, I do need documents without actual accented
characters.  I would most like them with the accent markers in text accord-
ing to the afforementioned (sp) guidelines.  Maybe I should put them on the
ftp site?  Probably a good idea.  They'll be under GUIDLINE.TXT in the 
articles directory.  (Dave, I'll send you a copy)

Right. I myself don't KNOW all that the Hluss and Ssu are capable of doing. 
Their societies are a closed book, even to me -- and please don't start 
writing a short history of the Ssu or a "Decline and Fall of the Ssu Empire!" 
I think that players ENJOY having mysteries and unexplainables, when it 
comes to otherworldly races and locales. I would have felt rather let down 
if H. P. Lovecraft had devoted a treatise to the reproductive habits of Yog 
Sothoth!  My feeling is that some horrors are fun NOT to see, to know, to 
understand... 

>>A Ssu doesn't need  
>>group pleasure any more than does a rattlesnake, a sea elephant, or  
>>a spider wasp.

Perhaps they do, within their own societies for the right cultural 
reasons...??

>>And all those species get together in bands at times  
>>for quite different reasons.

The inimical races do indeed have gatherings -- groupings, festivals, 
conventions -- I don't know what they do or why. I would be more than a 
little nervous to try to find out.

>Well, I haven't read the Orange adventure book in a long time.  But in 
>message 118 from Bob Dushay, he refers to a part of an adventure where

>until there is absolute proof one way or the other.

On p. 11 of the orange adventure book, the Hluss-mother uses a human 
captive (kept for food) to speak to the humans around her. She has him say,
"You -- have -- slain my brood, human. You have slain my children. Now you 
are come to slay me too!" What I was attempting to describe was total neural 
control over her captive: Note that SHE did not utter a word but rather 
used her captive's knowledge and organs to make him produce her message. Ssu 
and Hluss are thus definitely able to communicate, if you have a human or 
two to act as speakers -- and are willing to accept damage done to the 
specimen! Notice, however, that the Hluss-mother's message was simple and 
expressed haltingly. Communication is thus not easy -- nobody can sit  
down and negotiate with these creatures or read them the comics page! They 
are clearly intelligent, above the level of bees or ants by a long way, but 
they are NOT able to -- or interested in -- communicating with their hated 
enemy (humanity) except in the direst of circumstances, and then only in 
short, simple words that can be wrung out of a helpless captive, expressing
concepts the Ssu or Hluss clearly comprehend and which fit into their own
cultural matrices. I would be a lot more comfortable if these species did 
NOT try to communicate with me in this unpleasant fashion...

[Moderator's Note:  As I read it today, I saw two possibilities.  The human]
[                   used to communicate was in extremely bad shape.  No    ]
[                   skin on the skull, etc.  Gruesome...  As I said 2 pos- ]
[                   sibilities, 1) that the Hluss Mother had some type of  ]
[                   telepathic control, or 2) that it was being controlled ]
[                   physically, such as a ventriloquist's dummy.           ]
[                   It sounds from the description above, that it was more ]
[                   like  #2.                                              ]

All in all, this discussion has been most interesting, with everybody 
making some good points. There is much here to think about, far more 
than the usual science-fiction "aliens" that are either mindless, 
murderous monsters or else  humanoid enough to pass for humans with pointy 
ears! (Or, as in the case of some various recent TV series, humans with 
rubber noses or foreheads glued on to make them "alien").

Even given the rare and unusual example of the Hluss-mother in the orange 
book, I don't consider communication between humans nad the inimical races 
to be very likely, or even very possible -- not in any depth or with much 
sophisticated transfer of information. Given the best intentions and a clean 
slate on both sides, perhaps the Ssu and Hluss could have communicated with 
the first-contact humans who landed on their world, but it's a little late 
now for peace, love, and $24.00 worth of beads ...

Let me think on this matter, and I may be able to come up with other examples 
of communication between the inimical species and our own. Sometimes I think 
Yog Sothoth would be easier to natter with.

Hu'on in Action 
 
by David Lemire  
 
Cheku'unish Arodle, merchant of the Clan of the Bronze Oblong in Kheiris, 
was making his usual caravan rounds from Kheiris to Fasiltum when, while 
passing the Kurt Hills on his way to Bey Su, he witnessed the harrowing 
encounter below. The narration which follows is intended to serve as a 
springboard from which to discuss Hu'on, the system of unarmed combat 
taught in the clandestine monasteries of the Temples of Ksarul and his 
Cohort Gruganu. 
 
It was late in the month of Lasdara and I was despairing of making Bey Su 
by Dhahla tenth for the Tsolyani Feast of the Accession when I had a most 
unsettling experience. My caravan had stopped for the night at a Sakbe 
road tower near the Kurt Hills, their thickly forested heights had been 
tumbling toward our grey-brown ribbon of road all day. Now they stood just 
over the wall. The guard tower was larger than usual, almost a castle, 
thanks to the quarries they provided. In any case, I remember having left 
my caravan to my clan-brothers and gone on a rare search for diversion in 
hopes of curing the headache I had, worrying all day over the Arjashtra 
River crossing. I found a game of Kevuk being played by eight Kurtani 
tribesmen and a mild individual with bright, intelligent eyes, a quick 
wit, and an indefatiguable smile. Playing Kevuk with Kurtani cutthroats! 
Something compelled me to stop and watch. The Kurtani, with their leather
jerkins and braided hair and beards, were quaffing ale by the khu'uma. 
They laughed, cracked weak jokes and shoved or clouted one another while 
the other man, who wore a faded black robe and odd ankle-length pleated 
skirt of thick Firya-cloth, smiled amiably or spoke as though he were 
amongst his closest clan-relations instead of a pack of up-country 
ruffians. Everyone called him Njumutokh, which means in Tsolyani simply 
"gambler". His initial resources lost, the nearly shaven-headed gambler 
then produced five Suor, the large golden coins of great Engsvanyalu. 
Betting reached a fever pitch and then suddenly the luck of the Kurtaniyal 
broke. The gambler threw "Ksarul - Black" three times in a row. With a 
wide grin, he reached out to scoop the Kumesukan toward himself. What 
followed took no more than a couple Si'ila [one Si'ila equals 4.5 seconds] 
to unfold. 
A Kurtani to the wanderer's foreward left, whom others called Tikkun, 
seized the Njumutokh's outstretched right arm just above the wrist. 
Instantly the gambler was on his feet, his left hand locking Tikkun's 
hand in place like an iron vise, his right hand rotating inside, up, 
across, and down in a savage open-hand slash that audibly, and horribly, 
broke Tikkun's wrist. He then executed three or four left backfist 
attacks to Tikkun's eyes, temple, and throat while holding the hapless 
Kurtani off-balance by pulling his still outstretched right arm (now 
broken at the wrist). His final backfist grabbed Tikkun's wicker bowlcap, 
his right hand flashed foreward to grab the Kurt-ani's beard, then, 
tilting the bully's head slightly back as he came, Njumutokh drove a 
thudding knee smash into his opponent's nose. Using a dead man's head 
for balance, he immediately unleashed a high side kick to his right 
rear (so hard it made his long skirt pop like a sail!). The kick struck 
the next nearest Kurtani just beneath the jaw; he dropped on his face like 
a stone. By now a third Kurtani had lunged wildly foreward with his dagger 
aimed at the gambler's stomach. But Njumutokh was ready. Still on one 
foot, he grabbed the attacker's knife hand in both his own. Arms stiffly 
foreward, he turned the Kurtani's attack momentum downward and then circled 
his knife hand out and up, pivoting inside on his left foot (having by now 
reset his right, which provided the step-through for the inside pivot). 
The low inside pivot torqued the Kurtani's wrist such that his thumb now 
pointed downward, his knife now pointed at his own belly. And there it 
plunged. The grab, pivot and plunge were absolutely seamless in their 
execution.  The knife plunge's power had lifted the unfortunate Kurtani 
off his feet. As he fell on his blade yet another attacker lunged over 
his falling comrade with a wicked short sword thrust. The gambler merely 
continued his left circle. Allowing the sword to graze his ribs, he 
grabbed this Kurtani's wrist with his left hand, locked his right elbow 
under his opponent's elbow, and then drove further through his continuing 
left pivot, using his hips and shoulders to throw the poor tribesman while 
at the same time breaking his elbow and taking his short sword. The landing 
chipped his tailbone, but this was accidental. I had been able to take but 
one step backward, frozen as I was by the sheer intensity of the combat. 
There stood Njumutokh, a Kurtani short sword reverse gripped in his left 
hand, a relaxed, almost playful, expression of readiness apparent in his 
every form and feature. Across from him stood four surviving Kurtani, now 
wielding knives, swords, and staves. Two came on with a shout, one swinging 
a sword from the wanderer's foreward left, the other darting quickly around 
to the right rear while bringing a stout quarterstaff into play. The 
gambler melded suddenly and instantly with their converging momentums. 
He spun on the ball of his left foot toward the foreward Kurtani, 
intercepting his high arcing sword hand with his own uprising right -- 
there the iron grip. His reverse gripped Kurtani sword drove backwards 
while his grappled victim dove foreward across his back and over his 
shoulder. The backward drive of the gambler's Kurtani sword ripped into 
the belly of his assailant, whose foreward flip, and the gambler's savage 
return, tore out the Kurtani's spleen. Before the return, however, 
Njumutokh swung the grappled sword hand of his assailant down across the 
path of the other Kurtani attacker's quarterstaff swing, which had missed 
its target because of the gambler's evasive left spin. The sword bit 
savagely into the quarterstaff wielding Kurtani's foreward left arm just 
as his staff hit the hard-packed dirt of the market yard. Exploding in 
the opposite circular direction, Njumutokh ripped his reverse gripped 
Kurtani sword up diagonally across the staff wielder's throat while 
chopping down the other assailant with his own sword. He now faced the 
two remaining tribesmen, a captured sword in each hand. The two Kurtani 
turned on their heels and ran. No more than two Si'ila [just over 8 
seconds] had passed during the entire combat. 
 
From this description it is clear that Hu'on is not simply a martial art 
style using kicking and footwork. Of the fourteen separate techniques 
employed by the Hu'on master in the above account, only two were kicks. 
Three or four were punches. Four were sword attacks. Five were 
grapple/throw/joint techniques. Hu'on is known as a kicking style because 
it does teach spectacular spinning, leaping, and double kicks, the 
hardest techniques in fighting to master and maintain, but in actual 
combat it is a very balanced style well suited to dealing with any 
life-or-death situation. Hu'on teaches ground fighting and grappling, open 
hand strikes, punches, and kicks, and even certain weapons, as an integral 
part of its training program. The short sword, quarterstaff, and assassins'
weapons are its specialty. Beginners develop their coordination, balance, 
and flexibility through a variety of exercises; intermediate students work 
on increasing their agility, power, accuracy, and endurance through 
further exercises and sparring; advanced students command such things as 
timing, perception, speed, and mental strength/ endurance through numerous
"secret" challenges. It takes about five years of dedicated training to 
master the basics of Hu'on, but even twenty and thirty year Huathudaliyal 
insist that the learning never ever ends. For short term espionage 
missions, for the Ndalu Clan or the other secret societies within the 
temples of Ksarul and Gruganu, there is a pared down, lean and mean, 
version of Hu'on which stresses only the most straight-foreward, easily 
mastered, and instinctively recalled techniques. Chokes, strikes, kicks, 
and locks that can be used successfully even when exhausted, wounded, or 
when the mission has gone really wrong: it is this version that is taught 
to the Omnipotent Azure Legion's political arm. The OAL, it must be said, 
adds further elements from Dedaratl, Charage, and just plain filthy 
brawling. The basic system, however, upon which OAL unarmed fighting builds,
is Hu'on, and the OAL's many Stability worshippers care not one shred 
about this because they know Hu'on is much more realistic than Dedaratl 
or Charage when it comes to actual combat in some dark, cramped, space 
far from friends and the protection of the Imperium.  Perhaps a return 
to the opening narration will further clarify the philosophy of Hu'on: 
 
There again stood the gambler -- two Kurtani lay behind and four more lay 
in front or to either side. His unassuming smile became for the first time 
dark with concern as he arranged the bodies of the dead and examined the 
condition of the wounded. He asked me for help as he attended the latter. 
Soon Imperial guardsmen from the castle arrived. They questioned the 
mysterious traveler briefly and then led him away to their commanders. 
He acquiesced with that same winning smile. To my utter amazement, he 
was back within a Thanmra [180 minutes] trying to scrounge up another 
game of Kevuk. He even wheedled my caravan guards! I approached, asked 
his lineage and clan, and complimented his warrior skills, saying that 
I doubted the great hero Pendarte could have done so much with so little 
in so short a space of time. He laughed, said people really called him 
Njumutokh, but failed to identify his clan or any other affiliation. He 
was so personable I hardly noticed. I agreed to play Kevuk with him, 
and in the course of our hours together -- the game lasted until dawn -- 
I learned a little about the philosophy behind his martial art. Njumutokh 
said, for instance, that combat is life and death, and that life and 
death are both "becoming" -- both "Change in its suchness." He said the 
great mistake of many styles of martial art, whether armed or unarmed, 
is the establishment of rigid forms students are required to practice 
constantly; this completely chokes off their ability to respond in a 
real, constantly shifting and changing, situation such as mortal combat.  
 
So Hu'on stresses the "change" in combat and most training consists of 
sparring with partners instead of learning forms by rote. More later, 
including Dedaratl and the martial arts of other nations, such as Livyanu.

[Moderator's Note:  Sandy Petersen talks about LARPs, and specifically notes]
[                   the existence of a Tekumel LARP.                        ]

In a private conversation with Chris, I asked him if he was going  
to come to Dave Cheng's Tekumel LARP. Chris's response was the  
logical, but unexpected, "What is a LARP?" This posting is, frankly,  
only relevant to Tekumel inasmuch as the Tekumel LARP ought to be  
tons o' fun, so anyone who wants to discuss Engsvanyali grammar or  
something else can delete me now.

[Moderator's Note:  What Sandy doesn't say, is that I did eventually figger']
[                   out what LARP meant.  :)  He did, however, confirm its  ]
[                   meaning for me.                                         ]

What is a LARP?
	The major form in the USA consist of a sort of cross  
between interactive theatre, a roleplaying game, and a game of  
Diplomacy with about fifty players. When you show up at the game  
(which may last from several hours to a whole weekend), you are  
handed your character, described in more or less loving detail. Your  
character has goals, special powers (usually), etc., all laid out  
for you to utilize or ignore, as best fits your personality.
	Combat is normally _not_ acted out, but is symbolized in  
some manner (in the Cafe Casablanca game I ran, we used Rock Paper  
Scissors, and in the King's Musketeers, we used a variation on  
Simon). There are gamemasters, who answer player questions,  
instigate major plot changes, and so forth, but they do not dominate  
the play as in a tabletop game -- really, they're more like  
referees than "real" GMs.
	These games are exceedingly fun -- the most fun I've ever  
had fully clothed. Typically a large number of the players come in  
costume, though perhaps an authentic Tekumel costume is a bit much  
to expect :(. Still, a lot of mileage can be gotten with a simple  
cloak and plastic sword. Emotions run high, and treachery, deceit,  
as well as loyalty and honor are all plentiful. And you don't have  
to worry about being killed, since you're only playing for one  
weekend. The most fun I ever saw a player have in a LARP was a guy  
who was arrested, had a show trial, and was then publicly executed.  
He was the focus of attention of the whole game for a couple hours.

I think a Tekumel LARP would indeed be tons of fun. I hope it comes to pass. 
I'll be happy to be on hand, if it occurs somewhere I can travel to easily -- 
like within a radius of 5 miles of my house!

The person you saw, Chris, was Curtis Scott, who ran the New Orleans Tekumel 
convention. Alas, Curtis died in an automobile action while travelling to (or 
from?) GenCon a few years ago. He was a wonderful gamer and a good friend. May 
Lord Ksarul accept him directly into the Blue Room...

[Moderator's Note:  I had no idea that was Curtis inside all that black      ]
[                   velvet and silver mask...  Amazing!                      ]

David Cheng wants to hold a Tekumel get-together in Minneapolis or St. Paul -- 
perhaps next year. I wish him well and promise to be there, if my health 
permits.

[Moderator's Note:  Professor Barker answered these questions from someone  ]
[                   who opted not to join the list.  He still wanted to     ]
[                   share the answers.                                      ]

I will happily reply to this person's questions. I'm sorry he didn't join.

>I understand most of the listed clans are all of at least high
>standing, and that within clans there are families, and lineage
>is then passed to the children.

The listed clans in the old Zocchi "Sourcebook" include a selection of high. 
medium, low, etc. They were all Tsolyani clans, and only a mention has been 
given here and there, of Livyani, etc. clans. The lineages cross over from 
one clan to another, although "high" lineages tend to be found only in 
"high" clans, etc. In vol. 1 of "Adventures on Tekumel," I included only 
high clans because most players want the independence and financial freedom 
to adventure -- and don't want to e ordered around, spat upon, or otherwise 
treated like scum. (As one of my friends always puts it: "I am a scuzz-bag 
in this world; I do not wish to be a scuzz-bag in somebody elses...") 

>Here comes the question. Is lineage within Tsolyanu passed via
>matriarchal or patriarchal lines? Is this something that is negotiated
>within marriage contracts? (The Clan member named in line 3c, will
>join the Family of X Y and Z with the following conditions. The lineage
>of X will be passed to the children born of union with 3c, economic
>duties will entail blah blah blah, etc.) Or are marriages more standardized?

Marriages tend to remain within the same or closely related clans, although 
LOTS of exceptions exist, particularly with second, third, etc. marriages 
that include one wealthy or higher class mate who marries "down" into a 
lower clan/lineage in order to get a beautiful wife or a handsome husband. 
The clan and lineage of the child is usually that of the father, but is he 
is the "lesser" member of the union, he may get his wife to negotiate 
membership in her (=higher) clan for the children. If the union is about 
equal, the couple may agree that a first child belongs to the husband's 
clan, a second to the wife's, etc. -- or ask an omen from the gods, roll 
a pair of dice, etc. Sometimes economic, familial, and other consider-
ations come into play, too.
 
>It is difficult for members of different social classes to mix, since
>there is such cultural seperation. However, once you are of at least a
>high clan, what is more important, clan or lineage? Who would give deference
>in a social meeting, a member of White Stone clan of a very very old
>lineage, and a good family, or a member of Golden Bough clan of a rich
>family group, but which doesn't have as vaunted a lineage?

The clan is what counts for "seating" at banquets, ceremonies, etc. Within 
the clan, deference goes to higher versus lower lineages, then to age. 
Gender does not play much of a part.

>To get a specific. I probably am the highest Clan within our group being

Blue eyes opens a whole new can of worms (no Sarku pun intended!). Blue 
eyes are considered a curse and an abomination (read "Man of Gold"), and 
you may be shunned in spite of being Sea Blue. I dimly remember from my 
history lessons a prince who had blue eyes and was not allowed to compete 
in the Kolumejalim because he was likely to prove to be a misfortune for 
the Empire!

My suggestion: since dark glasses don't exist on Tekumel, go to one of the 
better temples of Lady Dlamelish and see if they can fix the colour of your 
eyes with either spells or some kind of dye. (The latter may affect your 
eyesight, so use it sparingly!)

>Other questions if you have the time, might be how strict are temples with
>acolytes, do acolytes normally stay at the temple if they have the money to
>do otherwise? Do they keep slaves at the temple? Are the acolytes themselves
>expected to do chores? Is this something understood socially? Or are these
>considered 'beneath' someone of high clan?

Answers: the temples are usually quite strict with acolytes. Acolytes 
usually live in the temple dormitories while in training, although wealthy 
kids do get to go home a lot, if their families live in the same city. 
Money may be wonderful, but where would you go to live? "Apartments" 
("flats") are not common, particularly for young people who have clans 
and families. People WITHOUT clans/families may have to live somewhere 
in the city, but the quarters they may have to rent would not be very 
nice and might bring about a good deal of social eyebrow-raising. The 
temples have large contingents of slaves, many living in temple quarters. 
The priests can order these about, although acolytes can only give orders 
within permitted limits. Slaves do most of the "chores": dishes in the 
refectory, laundry, room-cleaning, etc. But don't command a slave girl 
to sleep with you -- unless your temple preceptor gives permission or 
orders you to do so first. (He/she may feel it is "healthy" for a young 
person to have such a bedmate -- especially in the temples of Avanthe & 
Dlamelish.)

>Have I bombarded you with enough queries yet? If not, how blase would someone
>of a high upbringing be about magic. Is there such a thing as 'common' 
>magics?

No common magic. People know that magic exists, but not everybody has 
seen it.

Thanks and regards, M. A. R. Barker

[Moderator's Note:  Sorry David.  I didn't mean to open the bag, as it were. ]

The cat is out of the bag, so I might as well make it official.

I am in the very preliminary stages of organizing a Tekumel-Con,
in Minneapolis, for Summer/Autumn 1996.

I've corresponded with Professor Barker and he has given his blessing.

I see this event as 98% Tekumel.  What that other 2% would be, I don't
know.  I saw people playing _Magic: the Heroin_ at RuneQuest-Cons past, so
I guess I should keep an open mind.

I expect to get about 100 attendees.  We'll have many various RPG sessions
(EPT, S&G, Gardasiyal, Tirikelu, or whatever you want to bring).  I've
already heard from a few folks who promise to bring minis, including John
Medway & Rob Smith, who as you know are sculpting (and selling!) their own
line of 15mm figures.  They're also developing a custom set of minis rules
(I've played, and they're maximum fun).

We'll have several Tekumel-related seminars, to be chaired by Prof Barker,
Bob Alberti, and other luminaries.  I'll almost certainly steal an idea
from RQ-Con, renamed as "The Tekumel Lore Auction."

The biggest (and most suicidally ambitious) event will be the planned
Tekumel LARP.  I see this as a 100-player undertaking, with no other events
scheduled concurrently, to take place all day Sunday.  We'll see how things
develop.  

Of course, we need volunteers.  Please think about if you'll be able to
attend, and if so, what you can do.  We'll need a bunch of people to run
RPG, Board & Minis events.  We'll need some to work registration, etc.
We'll need a few to help with the LARP, whether to write characters or
just to be GMs/NPCs.

This may seem like a strange request, but we need women.  For the
LARP, that is.  It just won't be the same if we don't get enough
females into the game.  I don't know about you, but the thought of 
playing a seduction card on some guy wearing green silk veils just
doesn't do it for me...  If you have women in your gaming group, start
getting them psyched up for the con now.

At past RQ-Cons we had folks travel from around the world to attend.  
I can only hope Tekumel is capable of engendering a similar level of
fanaticism.  The very-preliminary contact I've had with the _Eye of
All-Seeing Wonder_ group indicates that they'll be sending a
delegation.  Start saving up now.

What I need IMMEDIATELY is someone in the Minneapolis/St Paul area, or
someone a reasonable drive away, who can help me scout hotels.  I've
made some calls already, but flying from New York City just to 
look at prospective venues seems painfully expensive.  If this sounds
like something you might be able to help me with, please email me your
phone number ASAP.

You may think that travelling all the way to Minneapolis just for a
gaming con is dumb.  That's what I thought too, but then I went to
England for _Convulsion of a Trillion Tentacles_, a
mainly-RuneQuest/Glorantha convention.  I came back psyched enough to
organize RuneQuest-Con in January 94.  

I've been helping or leading cons for about fifteen years now, so 
I know what I'm doing.  If you attend, I'm pretty sure you'll feel 
it was worth it.  It could very well be a once-in-a-lifetime kind
of event.

If you're interested in helping out, please email me directly.

[                   you need.  Of course they'll be lots of Free Pub on the ]

[Moderator's Note:  Floyd Brigdon asks about the worship of Dra.             ]

Dear Floyd,

>      1)  What is the nature of the worship of Dra? With the other deities,
>it is pretty easy to see what the scope of their "influence" is and what
>sorts of activities might be associated with them. With Dra, though, this is
>puzzling. Aside from singing the Hymns of Hnalla's Praise, what activities do
>priests of Dra engage in? What about the average (non-schooled) worshiper?

Dra is indeed somewhat of a problem. His basic function is to focus upon 
the worship of the Divine Light of Lord Hnalla. He thus cares nothing for 
any of the Planes he is on, devoting himself so utterly to his Master that 
he is almost unconscious of what is around him -- or happening to him. His 
role in our lives is as an example: a paragon of divine concentration and 
singleminded devotion.

Priests of Dra engage in rigorous denial of their surroundings. This is why 
others joke about them -- on Tekumel as people do here. These ascetics are 
in some ways akin to the Hindu Sadhus and Sanyasi who sit motionless so 
long that it is said that moss grows upon them! -- Or hold their arms up 
in the air until the arm atrophies and cannot be lowered again. This is NOT 
an easy life, nor is it one of porcine laziness, as understood by some 
players over the years.  Rituals consist of Sufi-like chanting of verses 
from Lord Hnalla's traditional hymns. This is often done in solitude, but 
one also finds small groups of these priests (and a few priestesses) 
performing these rituals together. Temples to Dra are built not by his 
worshippers but by followers of Lord Hnalla, as a sort of charitable act: 
a gift to people who are considered holy and who cannot or will not build
shrines themselves.

The "average" non-ascetic Dra worshipper comes from a clan and lineage that 
historically worships Dra. There are very few converts, of course, and most 
of these are ascetics and zealots who wish to devote their entire spiritual 
and physical being to the worship of the Divine Light. Those who are not so 
spiritual-minded go on with their humdrum, mundane lives. They also serve as 
caretakers for their more ascetic brethren, arranging for food, cleanliness, 
lodging, etc. as their contribution to the worship of their strange, aloof god.

>     2) What sort of temples does the Temple of Dra have? I seem to remember
>someone (it was probably on the usenet) joking about a priest of Dra living
>out of the Tekumel equivalent of a cardboard box. Is this impression correct
>or do the Temples of Dra share the same lavishness as those of the other
>Gods?

As said above, temples to Dra exist in almost every large city. They are 
usually built and maintained by the temple of Hnalla (often adjoining or 
next door), and food, candles, sleeping mats, etc. are supplied by less-
ascetic worshippers and well-wishers. After all, Dra is the Devoted One, 
the Lord of Hymns, He Who is Blinded by the Eternal Light. It is considered
"noble" for others -- members of such temples as Avanthe, Dilinala, 
Belkhanu, Qon, and even Chegarra -- to sanction and support Dra's role, 
making small offerings of food, money, clothing, etc. to Dra worshippers 
who need these things.

A temple to Dra is usually just a square room, sometimes with small 
storerooms attached, where supplies are kept. Sleeping mats are scattered 
here and there, and the most ascetic (and hence physically helpless) 
worshippers and "clergy" sit wherever they wish, facing towards the temple 
of Hnalla. Caretakers from the Dra-worshipping clans move among these people,
feeding, washing, gently moving and massaging limbs, and caring for their 
charges.

>     3) Does Dra figure in any of the epics in any function other than in his
>praise of Hnalla? Did he, at some point, have a different "personality"?
>(Perhaps he is an example of what happens to gods when they "burn-out"? :) )

Yes, he figures in several of the epics: he is mentioned as "with" Lord Hnalla 
at the Battle of Dormoron Plain; he praises Lord Hnalla  in a rather beautiful 
Engsvanyali hymn during the hero Hrugga's battle against the Demon Qu'u. He is 
seen in a more active role in one of the Jakallan song-cycles about the Heroes 
of the Age -- but this seems to be apocryphal and not part of the canon.

>     4) Does he have Aspects like the other deities or is he a
>"what-you-see-is-what-you-get" kind of god?

He has only one Aspect: himself. He never needs to appear in other forms, it 
is said, because he must always concentrate upon the Divine Light. This makes 
him quite insensible of his physical appearance.

"Playing" a devotee of Dra has its drawbacks. One can play one of his less-
ascetic devotees, of course, and go about one's human affairs normally. But 
to play one of the Devoted is like wanting to play a Hindu Sadhu: how long 
do you sit on top of the mountain peak before you get bored and decide to 
play something else? Dra is very important in the scheme of Tsolyani 
religion, but he is not a deity who lends himself easily to action-
adventure-role-playing!

[Moderator's Note:  It sounds from the above information that those who ]
[                   are less ascetic, spend what would have been their  ]
[                   time learning etc, in the temples of Thumis, and    ]
[                   Hnalla...  Especially the Sorcerers and their temple]

[                   learning within the temple of Hnalla???             ]  

I hope this helps. Phil.

[Moderator's Note:  Bob Alberti and Professor Barker answered some questions  ]
[                   about Tekumel and the Weaver of Skeins for someone reading]
[                   alt.games.frp.tekumel on Usenet.                          ]

NET: So Tekumel's surface area is roughly 67% bigger than Earth's.

BOB:And has been pointed out, Tekumel's land/water ratio is much higher than 
BOB:Earth's, so there's a LOT more land.
 
NET: So, there are maps of the
NET: land area of Tekumel?   *slobber slobber*  When do we Unwashed get to
NET: see 'em?  I'm dying to know what the long-fabled Southern Continent
NET: looks like, what tane looks like, where the Nom come from, where the
NET: Chima sail, etc.  I'd also like to see cultural information for the above
NET: places, names, maps, spells, laws, societies, etc.  Of course, I know
NET: I'm probably dreaming, but it would be great to see this stuff come out.

BOB:The globe in question exists, but it by no means presents the entire
BOB:surface area all nicely mapped out for inspection.  The TOME maps
BOB:represent about one-
BOB:third of the northern hemisphere.  The Southern Continent takes up (I think)
BOB:about half the southern hemisphere.  The "back side" of the planet is an
BOB:array of island chains with a couple of larger islands but no major
BOB:continents (if
BOB:I'm recalling correctly).
 
BOB:The southern continent is shaped roughly like a long oval or rounded
BOB:rectangle and covers half the southern hemisphere.  I've seen the map
BOB:of it once or twice, but having not travelled it extensively it was pretty
BOB:hard memorize it.

MARB:Your memory is fairly accurate. It is a BIG planet, however, and 
MARB:- frankly - I myself have never completely exxplored the other side. 
MARB:A lot of that region is owned by the Hokun or the Chima -- and perhaps 
MARB:other races. There may also be some human enclaves over there. I know 
MARB:there's one just over the north pole on the other side of Yan Kor. 
MARB:Occasional ships make the passage. (I suspect a lot more do NOT make it.)

MARB:I had originally planned to draw up maps, etc., but the complexities 
MARB:of THIS side of Tekumel were so many and demanded so much attention 
MARB:that I never got around to formalising the rest of the planet. Soon, 
MARB:I hope ...

MARB:Re:the "Weaver of Skeins." He is a common figure in most of the Five 
MARB:Empires (I think the Salarvyani may not have him..?). No myths or 
MARB:legends are told of him, and in this regard he is rather like the 
MARB:"Sandman" or the "Tooth Fairy," although Fate or Luck might better 
MARB:represent his role. He is indeed a metaphorical construct, rather 
MARB:than a person.

NET: The Tsolyani
NET: seem to have a Death figure (Missum) who seems at once a metaphorical
NET: figure (the Reaper of Souls who makes all things die) and an actual
NET: Demon Lord who can be summoned, placated, etc.  However, it does not
NET: seem to be that Missum is actually responsible for all Death, just that
NET: it seems to be an area of... well, let's say "interest" for that 
NET: particular worthy.

MARB:This is correct. "Death" is a metaphorical construct quite apart from 
MARB:the demon Missum, who brings "missum" (death). 
 
NET: Is there an actual "Weaver" demon who can be summoned
NET: to produce similar results?  Perhaps a demon of Stability with an essence
NET: or nature of Belkhanu (since an orderly death would seem to be his area
NET: of specialty)?  Anyone able to ask Prof. Barker himself?

MARB:That's "Phil" to anybody on the Blue Room. But, I must reply that I 
MARB:have not heard of a Stability _demon_ called the Weaver. He is just 
MARB:called "Elitokoi" ("the (noble) Weaver").

BOB:A "Weaver" demon would have to deal out destiny:  it would have to control 
BOB:the
BOB:fates of all persons in a much more sophisticated manner than does Missum.
BOB:People would have to be able to find mates, achieve glory, fall to financial 
BOB:ruin, make history or be forgotten by it, all due to the efforts of the 
BOB:Weaver.
BOB:This is not as easy to arrange as simple death-and-eternal-servitude.  So it
BOB:is not the case that a convenient demon has come along to fill that function
BOB:and hence "become" the Weaver.

MARB:Oh, I suppose it's easy enough if the legends grant you all the powers 
MARB:you require to do these tasks: cf. the concept of an "Omnipotent" god. 
MARB:Your explanation is thus not really a "reason"; but the idea is essen-
MARB:tially correct.  Having one being in charge of all fate, destiny, etc. 
MARB:would infringe upon the powers of the (thoroughly jealous!) gods and 
MARB:would cause religious upheavals throughout the Five Empires!

MARB:I think the Five Empires enjoys the visual, personalised concept of a 
MARB:(faceless) human who weaves a great tapestry, patterning the skeins and 
MARB:putting meaning and design into the universe. The Tsolyani in particular 
MARB:are great visualisers -- not abstract thinkers very much -- and the Weaver 
MARB:appeals to them greatly.

I have the strong feeling that this is one of the reasons that one of my 
gaming friends has chosen to play a priest of Ksarul.  That mask sure comes 
in handy as a reason to hide ones eyes.  Maybe he really does have a rare 
skin complaint, or maybe he has hit on a replacement for ray-bans.

As a general rule, having one really awful problem does tend to help 
players find a reason to act in the game, and the Professor's idea of going 
to the temple and asking for a favour is splendid indeed.  "As it happens, 
there is a shortage of that particular dye, sir.  If you could just run 
over to M'morcha and pick a few kaitar weight of the pretty red anthers

                   Dedaratl: Temple of Thumis martial art

                               by David Lemire
                              Dedaratl Inaction

Dedaratl, the martial art developed by and taught in the temples and
monasteries of Thumis and Ketengku, seems almost the opposite of Hu'on, the
other martial art now practiced in Tsolyanu (which was described in my last
dispatch to the Blue Room). Whereas Hu'on stresses external actions, such
as striking with initiative, strong combinations and counterattacks, and
advantageous evasions, Dedaratl concentrates on the esoteric spiritual
condition of having all parts of the self in complete and utter
coordination. The Hlakme, "the conscious mind", acts as perceiver. The
Baletl, the spirit-soul, acts as the center of 'Stability'. The Pedhetl,
the "reservoir of raw emotion", acts as the power source. The Chusetl, "the
shadow-self or unconscious mind", acts as the mind-body coordinator. And
finally the Bakte, "the physical body," acts as the instrument of response.
Dedaratl seeks to fuse these elements together through "a stringent,
continuous program of mental as well as physical application," quoted from
"Dedaratl lel Qadarkoi Prazhurin" (Dedaratl and the Eternal Struggle). Once
fused, any aggressive solicitation causes an immediate, and more
importantly "unimpaired", circle of response which includes perception,
evaluation-decision, and reaction. According to Dedaratl's theory of attack
and defense, the problem with most martial arts is that emotional,
intellectual, and environmental interferences disrupt even trained
combatants in high stress situations so that their reactions are either
weak or excessive. These disruptions take a variety of forms: some fail to
perceive an attack until it is too late; some are paralyzed by the very
fact of the attack or are too focused upon just one of its elements; others
poorly assess its speed, direction, or developmental momentum; finally,
some lack the physical conditioning to effectively respond. Dedaratl seeks
to remedy these shortfalls through the fusion of the five selves mentioned
above.
     "It is meaningless and self-defeating to concentrate on the outer
factors of a martial art", says Horu hiVrazhimu, who studied Charage as an
adolescent under his famous grandfather's direction but has since become
one of the greatest devotees of Dedaratl in recent centuries. He goes on to
stress:

"The body has its all too obvious limitations, but who can describe with
any certitude the mind's limits or its developmental possibilities. Combat,
in reality, begins in the mind! And the domain of the mind is limitless and
ever-expanding. To develop the imaginative and controlling powers of one's
mind, to fuse all the powers of the five selves -- only one of which being
the functional capacities of the Bakte, the physical body -- means the
possibilities of that self-same body will be enhanced and its general
functioning improved, while the character and personality is developed and
matured. Without inner growth, the rest is nyelmekh -- illusion!"

     Dedaratl thus pursues what in the literature is called a "noble"
defense strategy -- one in which the combatant instinctively selects the
proper techniques for neutralizing a particular attack, reacts so swiftly
that these techniques are applied while an attack is still developing or,
at higher levels of practice, before an attack has even been fully
launched, responds so consistantly that Dedaratl has become a part of the
combatant's overall self, and acts so powerfully that the entire combat is
controlled from beginning to end. Four principles have evolved over time to
achieve the above: the "Belkhanu"-principle (centralization), the
"Avanthe"-principle (extension), the "Karakan"-principle (leading control),
and the "Hnalla"-principle (sphericity). The first refers to a condition of
centeredness or "Stability", both inside and out, whether in combat or not.
The second refers to channeling the Pedhetl's vital force into one's
techniques to produce an immovable stance or irresistible action of
defense. The third refers to "leading" the potentially dangerous and
concentrated force of an attack into harmless channels (i.e., toward the
outer edges of its intended line of development, or beyond its intended
point of impact). And the fourth refers to the innumerable horizontal,
vertical, and diagonal circles into which the Dedaratl master leads his
opponent's attack(s).
     The principles of leading control and sphericity make it very clear
that Dedaratl is a combat art in which the bilateral strategy dominates. In
other words, Dedaratl is about responding, defending, reacting and
counterattacking rather than attacking. In fact, in its most traditional
form -- that taught in the famous Hauninggakte Monastery -- there are no
strikes at all! According to Dedaratl theory, direct attacks, especially
committed ones where the attacker is oblivious to anything other than
striking his target, render the attacker vulnerable at every stage of their
unleashing. Attacks cause an inevitable widening of the attacker's
defensive perimeter as hands, elbows, knees and feet move to bring the
weapon to its target. This "widening" creates numerous opportunities for
countermeasures: strikes, sweeps, grapples, throws, locks, bars, etc. The
Dedaratl stylist thus waits for his opponent to attack, and then slides in
toward, out beyond, or along side the line of his attack, and once there he
uses his opponent's own momentum to defeat him circularly. Some traditions
of Dedaratl refer to this as "gathamikh naikh" (lit., taking the spear).
There are other traditions of the art, however, which eschew all such talk
of strategy. Dedaratl, according to its grandmasters within the monasteries
of Ka'alur and Hauninggakte, becomes a part of one's nature. Once the
fusion of the five selves has been achieved, it flowers without strategy,
without thought. One reacts with no conscious intent when attacked.
Dedaratl happens spontaneously. It harmonizes opposing forces, thus
preserving "Stability". Attacks flow naturally around the "fused"
individual. The attacker, never knowing exactly how, finds himself flying
head over heels, or facedown in the dust with his arm and wrist locked
'just so.'
     This fusion of the five selves, it must be said, is achieved through
exercises similar to those taught in sorcerous acadamies for sharpening
Psychic Ability, so there is some question as to whether non-psychic
persons can ever truely master Dedaratl. Horu hiVrazhimu reports that he
can "see" an attack before it even begins. This level of pre-cognition
cannot be expected of general practitioners.
     Dedaratl, it must also be said, is not a unified art. There are
numerous branches of Dedaratl, ranging from what is thought to be the most
traditional and least aggressive (that style taught in Hauninggakte,
Ka'alur, and the temples of the far northeast) to the least traditional and
most aggressive (that style currently popular in Bey Su and other major
cities). As was said before, Hauninggakte Dedaratl has no strikes. Modern
versions of the art (those developed after A.S. 1000 roughly) simplify the
complicated techniques of traditional Dedaratl and include so-called
"finishing" or streetfighting moves: defenses designed to counter the most
common grabs, punches, chokes, kicks, and strikes of all kinds. These
include kicks, punches, strikes, and breakings that were never part of
Dedaratl before the religious wars of the ninth century. This spectrum
merely gives one an idea of the range of Dedaratl practice. Individual
masters further specialize. The priest Kerrune hiChuyon, for example,
emphasizes in his acadamy at Urmish the use of pressure points and other
physiological softspots within human and, where known, non-human anatomy.
The use of nerve secrets, knockout pressure point attacks, and potential
death blows clearly departs from the ease and spontaneity of traditional
Dedaratl, but many of his students argue that these innovations, along with
other more straightforward techniques to finish an aggressor, make Dedaratl
much more useful than it was previously. They also state that, in many
acadamies, time once spent on "the fusion of the five selves" is now spent
on strenuous athletic preparation and training in "every possible principle
of strategic application" because opponents are increasing in their skill
and power. This seems to be a tacit recognition that the bilateral strategy
is not applicable in every circumstance. For instance, when the opponent
feints, draws a Dedaratl counter, and then himself counters that counter!

[Moderator's Note:  Adam Levine looks for comment on the following...       ]

One of my players and I recently had a discussion about the Pariah gods 
and what they might represent.  The thrust of this conversation was that 
while Dlamelish is in some ways opposite to Avanthe, from an animistic 
point of view, a god that embraced the concept of total destruction by 
disease, defilement and decay would in fact be more representative.  I 
could easily see the worship of these concepts associated with one of 
the Pariah gods.  I would appreciate hearing from anyone with thoughts 
on this matter.

As I have said somewhere or other, the masks of the Ksarul priesthood are 
worn only for ceremonial reasons: certain rituals demand them. One doesn't 
wear heavy robes and masks in everyday life -- there would quickly be a lot 
of deaths from heat exhaustion! Ksarul priests (and priestesses) wear their 
fancy (hot and airless!) masks during various temple ceremonies and then 
strip them off (panting) and go about their usual businesss attired in no 
more than a kilt, tunic, and sandals!

Same reason why full plate armour is NOT worn when out for a walk, or when 
marching along a Sakbe road. More player characters have dropped along the 
wayside because of this than I can count.

Good adventure idea! The dye is found in Jannu, however, and is made from 
the crushed root of a vine that has deep violet leaves. I don't know the 
Jannuyani name, but  the locals will probably know what you want. A 
tincture of this stuff is used like eyedrops. As I said, it is not 
particularly good for one's sight.

Dear Adam,

>One of my players and I recently had a discussion about the Pariah gods 
>and what they might represent.  The thrust of this conversation was that

Pavar's pantheon does not necessarily include only "opposites" (in human 
terms).  The principle of stability/fertility/fecundity/cycles seems to 
the Tsolyani to be quite opposite to change/personal-pleasure/ephemerality/.
The Pariah Gods, if they can be understood at all, seem to seek total 
NULLITY, rather than just the opposite of some human emotion/concept. They 
are not interested in any single aspect of Being but rather in Non-being. 
They thus seek "Non-existence" as opposed to "Existence" (at least in our 
human terms). They are hard to fit into human concepts at all, and their 
only appeal is to greed (for wealth, power, etc. etc.), which they are 
willing to help their followers achieve for a time, until they finally 
decide to make their move and end all matter on the Planes they invade. 
This is not a happy fate, but their human adherents are willing to risk 
the chance that this horrible denouement will come later, rather than 
sooner. Millions of their followers, it is said, live out their lives, 
achieve wealth and power, and die perfectly natural deaths without ever 
having to face the invasion of their monstrous deity and the erasure of 
all being on their Planes.

The Pariah Gods are an interesting bunch. They are not, strictly speaking, 
"opposites" of any of Pavar's deities, however.

Professor Barker writes:

  I would argue that the pariah gods ARE opposite to ALL of Pavar's deities.
All of Pavar's pantheon deals with existance.  Even Sarku deals with continued
existance after death.  

  I have always looked at the pariah gods (as a player anyway) as the ultimate
in badness.  The "normal" pantheon seems to have it's own checks and balances
between themselves.  The Pariah gods seem more likely to just come in and do
what they want without these restraints.

  You also have to realize we are talking about gods, not just your friend 
down the street.  I don't think that the Professor will disagree when I say
that even he is not privy to all the machinations of the gods.

[Moderator's Note:  Sandy Petersen adds to the Pavar/Pariah topic.           ]

I think I understand the Pariah Gods now.

	You want the gold. The Ksarul priest wants the gold. You're  
willing to kill each other over it. Both of you might be considered  
"bad" by an Earthly onlooker. Along comes the Pariah God and he  
wants to _destroy_ the gold, so you and the Ksarul priest, and even  
non-humans, will unite against such a threat.

[Moderator's Note:  The Pariah Deity also wants to destroy you and the Ksarul]

	Presumably even the inimical races, if they understand the  
concept of a Pariah God, are more or less hostile to them. Though  
that doesn't mean they'll ally with humans vs. the threat, of  
course.

Professor Barker, I had the good fortune to know the late Curtis Scott 
and some of his associates from New Orleans.  They were the ones who 
first introduced me to Tekumel in the early 80's.

Based on various conversations and events that occurred during the game 
many years ago it is my understanding that: 

1.  The College of Ever-Living Wizards (Ever-Whizzing Lizards) is located 
in a bubble plane/dimension artificially created by it members and with 
primary nexus in Avanthar.

2.  Similarly, it is my understanding that a plane of the Mihalli exists 
and that it was created by these beings a half-step removed from our plane.

Professor, can you confirm or deny the above and provide any additional
details?

On to another topic ...

Given the five bodies described in the teaching of Pavar as well as stories 
and observations, I have a few thoughts on multi-planarness that I would 
like to submit for feedback.  

Two stories by way of background ...

I was once called upon to travel back in time through nexus points located 
in the tubeway to deliver a message to the High Priest of Vimuhla in 
Fasiltum (his name escapes me now).  This priest was also a very powerful 
sorcerer.  In order to prove to me that he was authentic, he split/duplicated 
himself before my eyes.

Thomar the Ever Living was once seen at the foot of a wall which surrounded 
a besieged city.  At the top of the wall stood a large contingent of combat
sorcerers.  Individual sorcery is generally thought to be impossible in the
vicinity of combat sorcery.  However, Thomar was not only able to magically
defend himself against the contingent, he was also able to fire back spells 
that killed may of them and eventually led to the fall of that city.

It is my thought that beings that exist on more than one plane are somehow 
able to duplicate at least the Bakte, Hlakme and Pedhetl.  I have no 
opinions at this point on whether the Chusetl and Baletl can also be 
duplicated; it's possible that these bodies are shared by all of the 
multi-planar bodies.  

For Thomar to perform magic in the above situation, I can see five likely
possibilities:

1.   He had a device that acted as a magical battery
2.   He had previously cast a spell that acted as a magical battery
3.   He had found a way to magically insulate his Pedhetl (in this plane) 
     from being drained
4.   He somehow tapped into the extra-planar energy used by the combat 
     sorcerers
5.   His Pedhetl was located on another plane making it immune to the 
     effects of combat sorcery but still accessible to him

It is this fifth option that I find the most intriguing.  Is it possible 
for one or more of the bodies to exist on other planes and still be able 
act effectively with the others as a whole entity?

If each entity (combination of bodies) can perform independently and have 
its own personality, this might explain the existence of the different
aspects/manifestations of the Gods.  To a being that can replicate itself, 
death of one duplicate body would seem to become meaningless.  If the 
knowledge of all of Hlakmes is somehow shared, this might explain the 
ability to know about events occurring simultaneously in other places 
and planes.

Und tzo Professor, am I completely whacked in the noodle or am I more or 
less on target?  Any clarification on how multi-planar entities exist 
would be appreciated.

Cheers ... Adam :)

[Moderator's Note:  Sandy Petersen continues on the Pavar/Pariah thread.  ]

>One would think that the inimical nature of the Ssu/Hluss/Hokun  
>might be exploited by the servitors/agents of the Pariah Deities to  
>gain entry/passage into Tekumel's plane.

	This blade cuts both ways. I have had a small insight as to  
just how the inimicals may view the Pariah gods. Consider: the  
influx of the alien humans, shen, etc. has destroyed much of Old  
Tekumel. The majority of the Pariah worshipers are almost certainly  
human. Whether or not you accept my hypothesis that the inimicals  
are social-insect cognates, there is strong evidence that they do  
rate collective survival above personal power (i.e., they are less  
"selfish" than humans), which indicates to me that they would be  
highly unlikely to accept the selfish, short-term Pariah worship on  
a regular basis. This is not so for the notoriously solipsistic  
humans.

[Moderator's Note:  Note that the professor said that greed was only one   ]
[                   motivator of Pariah worship.  He did not say that ALL  ]
[                   worshippers were thus motivated.  There are indeed many]
[                   other motivations for Pariah worship, including the    ]
[                   ancestral influence, just plain nuttiness :), etc.     ]

	Obviously, the humans are the major wedge the Pariah gods  
have stuck into Tekumel's world-system, and they must be wholly  
expunged, not only for the more obvious reasons, but because they  
present a dire threat to the entire cosmos so long as the Pariah  
Gods exist. Sure some humans fight against the Pariahs, too, but  
will their kids? How about their grandkids? You just can't trust the  
future generations. Imagine the disaster if the Emperor of a major  
state was a Pariah-worshiper, and managed to instigate his cult  
throughout his nation!

[Moderator's Note:  I don't think the humans are the only tools the Pariah ]
[                   deities use.  I think they would be around if the      ]
[                   humans weren't.  It might even make their job easier.  ]

Anyway, I rather like the idea of the inimicals knowing all about  
the Pariahs and being actively hostile to them in a way that  
_encourages_ them being even more hostile to humans at the same  
time.

>the professor said that greed was only one motivator of Pariah

>There are indeed many other motivations for Pariah worship,  
>including the ancestral influence, just plain nuttiness :), etc.

	Of course there are other influences. As a man steeped in  
the Cthulhu Mythos, it's obvious that greed is only one motive --  
maybe not even the most important (fear springs to mind -- "Oh  
Goddess of the Pale Bone, please kill us last!")  [That's true...mod]
	Regardless of motivation, it is clearly counter-productive  
to species survival to worship these dudes in the long term. Whether  
humans worship the Pariahs through greed, kookiness, stupidity, or  
fear, I was just implying that less self-centered races may have few  
Pariah God worshipers. I suspect, for instance, (with absolutely no  
evidence on hand to back it up) that the Pe Choi harbor  
comparatively few Pariah worshipers per capita.

[Moderator's Note:  Well, I wouldn't have expected the Pe Choi to have a   ]
[                   large portion of their population devoted to Sarku,    ]
[                   until I read the Prof's article on the Pe Choi, and    ]
[                   learned about the Wild Pe Choi in the Chakas, and their]
[                   favored deity appears to be Sarku.  So, can we say that]
[                   the Pe Choi don't worship the Pariahs? even per capita?]
[                   When I say large above, I guess I mean sizable.  I     ]
[                   don't know how big the Wild Pe Choi population is.     ]

>I don't think the humans are the only tools the Pariah deities  
use.  >I think they would be around if the humans weren't.  It might  
even >make their job easier.

	But think how much fun it is to have humans be the bad guys  
in this regard! The joy the GM can have as he extolls the heroism  
and selflessless of the Shunned Ones as they do their bit to save  
the entire cosmos by mopping up on this particular fragment of the  
human cancer (i.e., the PC party).  [This is an interesting idea...  mod]
	And then think of the drama if our PCs have managed to hunt  
down a band of Pariah worshipers. Just before we spring our trap, 	 
a horde of screaming Hluss pour out of the woods and attack the  
Pariahs, trying to kill them all. Hmm. Whose side do we join, if  
any?  
[Moderator's Note:  I think the Hluss would not find any difference between  ]
[                   the two combatants.  They would probably wait until one  ]
[                   side wiped the other, and then wipe the survivors.  Good ]
[                   sound tactics.                                           ]

Page through, look up the Blue Light Society
Blue Light Society: Mostly Harmless.
--
Now I find that as much can be guessed by an intrigue world such as Tekumel
by what is not said, as by what is said. In reading up more on the factions
within the various temples, the temple of Ksarul in general and the Inner
Societies, I was struck by something odd.
 
In many stories and games it is the very most skilled intelligence group of
which little is said. As I read through the postscript file on the Temple
of Ksarul, the Ndalu clan, the Refulgent Blue Curtain society and the Blue
Lights something just didn't feel right in the dynamics. The Ndalu clan is
rather influential, people are scared of them, there is a lot known, because
they take an active role in things. The RBC society is more secrative, but
again there is a good amount known about them. They are respected, and feared
for their influence behind the scenes. The Blue Light society has about one
paragraph of information, no members are listed, it seems better able to
cooperate with other temples (being seen as more open in the sharing of
knowledge) and is considered 'harmless'.
 
Is there no suspicion here? Of all the societies of the Lord of the Blue
Room, the Blue Light society has the capability of working with members of
other temples (outside the more 'sinister' Trinity.) They thus have access
to information that the other groups don't. Despite the fact they probably
work with other temples more often, still either very little is known about
them or they are considered minor enough not to have people wonder about
their actions. 
 
I have been thinking of writing things up more completely regarding the
Blue Light Society and how the dynamics may show that they (or a group
within their membership) are the true secret society within the secret
societies of the Temple of the Lord of Secrets.
 
Anyone interested? Anyone thought the same? Or are they mostly harmless.
 
Btw, if you hear of me getting into an accident or my accounts all closed
before I manage to get the next posting up, you'll know where to look for
answers. :)

[Moderator's Note:   David Bailey responds on the Pariah/Pavar subject.     ]

So, the pariah gods are interesting because they are not the opposite of 
the  twenty, eh?  I wouldn't normal mention his name, as this jumped up 
techno-deity already gets more than his fair share of bandwidth, but Ksarul 
isn't the opposite of his counterpart in the twenty either.  Many more 
worthy people have speculated that he is quite different in essence to the 
other gods, some have gone so far as to suggest that he is linked with the 
pariah gods by language, worship, history and the stories of his binding 
into the blue room.

In the last few years the GMs in our local game have started rumours that 
Ksarul is:

- a man who became a god
- a computer based artificial intelligence
- a pariah god
- a rather dangerous demon
- the intrusion into the pocket plane currently occupied by Tekumel of 
'real   universe' rescue efforts
- one of the original EPT characters gamed by MARB's Thursday group, who   
became a god 'because its so easy using AD&D rules :-)
[Moderator's Note:  That wouldn't have been ADnD rules, but the original   ]
[                   White Box DnD rules.  FYI.  The original EPT was re-   ]
[                   leased way ahead of ADnD.                              ]

So, is there a definitive answer to the nature of Ksarul?  

[Moderator's Note:  Let's hope not....  I'd miss all the fun speculation. ;) ]

[Moderator's Note:  David Bailey has offered up some color, in the form of  ]
[                   persons in the area of Pala Jakalla from the campaign   ]
[                   he is a part of (it may be his campaign, I wasn't sure).]
[                   This material is not part of Professor Barker's "Real"  ]
[                   Tekumel.  Thanks for sharing this, David!               ]

There have been a few mentions of Pala Jakalla in the past, and I thought 
that you might like the latest list of notables in the local temples.  It 
is meant as a quick aid, not as a complete directory, and is complemented 
by similar list for the clans, palaces and foreigners, (some of which have 
previously been published by Richard 'Jack' Bramah)


THE LEADING LIGHTS OF THE TEMPLES OF PALA JAKALLA

Hru'u

55 known members

The Chief priest is Taithokle hiVriddi, born in Chene Ho from an Aridani 
mother.  This man is practically ostracised by his original clan, but makes 
up for this with immense charm and cunning.  His personal wealth is 
rumoured to be substantially greater than the temple.  He takes a monthly 
trip into the local swamps, and always returns with fewer female slaves 
than he went in with.

The leading sorcerer is Gepetkal hiSsanussanu (19th level sorcerer, artist, 
poet and painter.) a specialist in crafting dreams for clients.  He knows a 
high level of Nightmare of Terror which he has modified to be non-lethal, 
some consider this to be the most intense experience one can have without 
visiting the Garden of Weeping Snows.  The client is left believing that he 
has truly experienced the events of the dream, which has lead to a few, 
accidental, misunderstandings between local nobles.  His standard charge is 
500k a night.

Other spells of the temple are not spoken of, but include at least T5 
versions of Vindication of Instability, Congelation and Transfusion.

The temple is moderately wealthy, about K60,000 in liquid assets, and has 
recently come into possession of several rare books dedicated to change.

Strong local societies include Cusp of Night, the allies of the N'dallu 
Society, they have 15 members; obviously none are 'open' about it.  They 
have the ear of the chief priest, and have grown more active recently.  
They have donated, through an intermediary, a hoard of weapons to the 
Legion of Deep Purple Dark.

There is representation of the Elect of Purple, a group of Theocrats, 
numbering 28 including the Chief Priest. Secretive but not fanatical.

Wuru

19 known members.

Ramissum hiDlelequ, Cloak of Azure Gems is the current chief priest.  A 
fanatic and declared homosexual, he maintains his position by posting all 
likely successors to far flung places.  He is at present serving out a 
period of notice before moving to a position in a monastery near Do Chaka.  
Considering the current situation in the Chakas, he is trying anything he 
can to delay this posting.

Jaimuli Ito (17th sorcerer. and 15th demonologist), a recent appointment 
forced on Ramissum by the Ito clan has taken the role of Chief Sorceror.  
Jaimuli is patient and personable, but has a reputation for being overly 
familiar with his superiors.  He is struggling financially, as he has 
several dozen relatives staying with him after they fled their homes in the 
West.  He often says that  only a fool would want a spell from a Wuru 
priest, but  T7 Liquefaction is openly advertised, for engineers one 
assumes.

The second most potent sorcerer is Midori Ito, a wild and unpredictable 
character.  (Even his renu has a reputation for insanity)  He has, on one 
occasion, demonstrated his ability to cast Eater of Souls, and rumours 
abound that he once used the awful Grey Hand, on a rival for a lover.  As 
he is immensely wealthy it is unlikely that he could be bribed into casting 
such spells for others.

It is a relatively poor temple, only about K25,000.  They attribute this to 
the expense of the joint ceremonies with Hrihiyal every year.

The societies are the same as Hru'u, with 3 members known in each.  The 
only unusual one is Masters of the Sixth Indigo Eye, activists and 
adventurers, the most infamous of whom is Midori Ito

Ksarul
48 members, so it appears.

Surimalal hiMarunusani, Cloak of Azure Gems.  A profound scholar and 
respected warrior, has the role of Chief Priest.  He earned his position 
through military service, having previously served in a Lightening Bringer 
unit.  At 48 he is enjoying this sinecure.

Changasa hiNazusa of the Dark Fear clan (21st level) is a technocrat and 
well known author of fictional tales. he carries the scars of an appalling 
accident which has resisted healing by any means.  He denies persistent 
rumours that he travelled to the unstraightened city, yet spent several 
years missing prior to becoming Sorceror here.

T10 spells to understand and recharge devices are offered. T5 Replication 
and most G spells can be found.

The temple has expanded its fiefs and holdings of town houses recently, 
thanks to the extreme generosity of Kurshetl hiSsanmirin, a noted 
demonologist and researcher.  (Noted because he is never seen without a 
mask of one sort or another).  There is currently building work on the east 
corner, where a small windowless round room is being built with very think 
walls.  The temple has a superb collection of ancient books, believed to 
include pre-Time of Darkness works.  The temple is rather insular, and has 
hoarded artefacts over millennia.  Over 50 eyes are held.

The Society of the Blue Light, secretists, hold sway in the temple at 
present. Their 28 members include the Chief Priest.  They also hold the 
majority of library rights, a constant source of irritation to others.

Refulgent Blue Curtain certainly has members in the hierarchy.  The key 
searchers are highly secretive, but have recently come into dispute with 
the temple of Thumis over the discovery by one of their sponsored 
expeditions of an ancient Miyalun and a Flute.

N'dallu Society of political activists have declared 28 respondents at the 
temple, and others outside it.  The true elite within this group are 
obscured.

ritualist. his Aridani wife is one of the Governors advisers.

powerful local politician is about to launch a claim for shamtla against 
the temple after he found a cohort of undead walking across his fief in the 
north of the province.

MAJOR SOCIETIES ARE:
Copper Tomb Society continues to rise in wealth, if not in public prestige. 
 It has links with the tomb robbers and the N'dallu.

Victory of the Worm are catacomb searchers and historians.  They are open 
about their affiliation, and include Masune.  They control the most recent 
find, and refuse to divulge its location.  (Servant say that Masune is 
expecting Dritchansa to visit, and wants all the Glory for himself)

MAJOR SOCIETIES ARE:

recruited their eighth member. they sponsor many minor expeditions and have 
a good reputation for ridding areas of unwanted inhabitants.  They lost 
several members to 'food poisoning' whilst on a hunting trip recently.

astute politician and administrator.  He has successfully divorced himself 
from his predecessors attempts to corner the grain supply in the area by 
way of granting monopolies to his cronies.

CHIEF SORCERER IS :
Tludimlal hiMarunal, a 25th level practitioner of the Red Mountain Clan.  
He too came from Fasiltum recently.

They have T8 Demonolgy, T8 Revivify and T5 Perfected Gems of Obliteration 
available commonly.

The Order of the Devouring Conflagration, supporters of the main ritual 
sacrifices. Zantlan hiEvegaz ( Red Sword ) a 23rd level mage, and the 
Aridani Mitoloni hiSerekal (Red Sword) frequently adventure to raise funds 
for the huge rites.

The Faithful of the Purifying flame are a local sect headed by the ex-Chief 
Sorcerer, Kutung hiKutang. They strive to create new rituals with which to 
bring greater glory to their lord, and to encourage the day of Final 
Cleansing. As yet they have had limited success, despite several sealed 
caskets sent by Mirusiya himself.

Chiteng

MEMBERS:
38 at present

calm down the locals.  41 years old he has bought his family with him,

There is no comparative for Devouring Conflagration, Chiteng priests tend 
to join the Company of the Orange Band. They are devoted to personal

shrines. They are lead by Aridani Aranandu hiMashkolar of Rising Sun.

Dlamelish

MEMBERS:
65

CHIEF PRIESTESS IS :
Dhupal hiKorunumissa of White Crystal is nominally in charge.  She is of 
immense physical beauty, but short tempered.  She served 10 years in the 
temple Legion serving groups fighting in the Deserts.

CHIEF SORCERESS IS :
Tlathiyala hi Korunumissa, lover of Dhupal and equally stunning on the rare 
occasions that she leaves her rooms, is head of rituals.  She could be 19th 
level.

Tlathiyala has recently taken on an assistant of 18th level who fled from 
Liviyanu and required a new body after surviving assassination by burning. 
Rumours are the girl is a historian and has phenomenal aptitude for magic.

Healings, and Empowering are available up to T8 (higher sometimes)  
Rejuvenation is not advertised but has been given up to T10 in the past.

WEALTH:
K95,000 or so

with the Chiteng and Wuru activists.  Through their grip on temple 
treasury, via Arikoyani hiNimosa they effectively run the day to day 
affairs of the temple.  They also run the various retirement homes and 
brothels in the town.

Hrihiyal

MEMBERS:
55

CHIEF PRIESTESS IS :
Among the somewhat anarchic temple rankings Paipagel hiMeshu of Green 
Kirtle and Hiperdal Se'eqel ( a convert from Tsatssayaga ) are usually put 
forward to speak for the temple.  They are frequently outspoken and 
outrageous, for instance in the ornate burial mound that they commissioned 
for Pathiqeng hiSsayunanu a notorious libertine.

CHIEF SORCERER IS :
Both Paipagel and Hiperdal are equally competent at magic, being 20the 
level.

Many spells can be found from the temples practitioners, but they prefer to 
cast them themselves

WEALTH:
Never discussed, but probably K75,000

MAJOR SOCIETIES ARE:
All of the Dlamelish societies have at least observer members from Hrihiyal.

The Maidens of Hidden Knifes are activists and adventurers with links into

members are concubines to wealthy nobles and military officers.  Abasudaste 
hiMeshi, an albino courtesan of national fame, sets up groups of Maidens in 
every city she visits, Pala Jakalla is the second oldest such group.

Belkanu

MEMBERS:
42

CHIEF PRIEST IS :
Tiervazha hiHrugginash, 63, of the Amber Cloak clan.  A compromise 
candidate 22 years ago, he has been surprisingly successful, attracting 
considerable gifts from the Might of Ganga clan.  One of his clan-sons 
married a nice Gangasa clan-girl.  Cautious and well mannered.

CHIEF SORCERER IS :
Yaliemra hiGangassa, 37 who shocked the town when he revealed that he had 
been in disguise as Kirrikmoi hiSsughano for four years, is registered as 
23rd level ( but has petitioned for the awesome 25th recently ) and the 
Chief Sorcerer.  A relative newcomer to Pala Jakalla he is rich and fat, 
and he is a little indiscrete on occasion, especially after too much of his 
favourite brandy.

Spells available: U/G Inscription, T9 Re-embodiment, T9 Viaticum of the 
Yellow Robe and various G/T others.

WEALTH:
About K90,000 in liquid assets. A square tsan of land has recently been 
added in the Mssuma valley. A substantial number of TMD's are apparently in 
their possession. That the wealth is a recent thing is evidenced by the 
repairs instigated to the temple fabric this year.

MAJOR SOCIETIES ARE:
Society of the Yellow Robe, performers of traditional funeral rites, of the 
dead. 19 members, all of whom tend to be middle aged or older. The chief 
income generators for the temple.

Light Above the Tomb are undead slayers and make forays into the underworld 
and tombs. Led by Kirrikmoi they have a high turnover of members. Only 5 or 
6 are active today.

Cloak of Feathers, who's 12 members are stability supporters, forming 
closer links with other temples. Their most surprising success has been in 
making links with a few priestesses of Hrihiyal and Dlamelish.

Qon

MEMBERS:
30

CHIEF PRIEST IS :
Elrenu hiGangasuru, 33, of Might of Ganga. he is known to be the figurehead 
of the Assistant Temple Commandant, Hareske hiDarmatek, 42, of Joyous of 
Vra. Hareske is an ex-adventurer and a potent sorcerer (20th), he is not 
only wealthy but eligable. His donations to the temple have earned him 
rapid promotion.

CHIEF SORCERER IS :
Fazhu hiDzhertikoi, apparently transfered from the main temple on Ganga at 
the personal request of Hareske.  ( Not to be outdone by Belkanu ) Fazhu is 
36, reserved and ascetic, but courteous and able to inspire respect.  He 
came registered to 22nd level but has lodged simultaneous petitions for 
23rd and 24th levels.  Fazhu is about to shock the Chief priest, and indeed 
the whole town, in much the same way as his twin brother Yaliemra 
hiGangassa, because he is really Emra hiGangassa, his twin.  Yaliemra and 
Emra have been in hidding for four years after being accused of attempting 
to kill Arsemqoi Jadthek hiVriddi General Tlangten, but have recently been 
pardoned by Avanthar.

Hareske and Fazhu are alone capable of the majority of T spells, besides 
calling on the other 20 sorcerers in the temple.  This makes the temple of 
Qon in Pala Jakalla a popular centre for sorcerers.

WEALTH:
K45,000 plus 'interesting devices'

MAJOR SOCIETIES ARE:
Golden Refulgence, devotees and theological activists, have 13 members. 
Simialar, but not identical, to Cloak of Feathers

Society of Release from Eternity. Linked to Light Above the Tomb, possibly 
including Fazhu and sponsored by Hareske.
Avanthe

MEMBERS:
61

CHIEF PRIESTESS IS :
Berushme hiBedlenta, an Aridani of Golden Bough.  She is 58 and a 
traditionalist who supports the Imperial party.  She recently won a case 
against Chaihellu hiSsanmirin, who suggested she was bisexual. ( she is a 
declared lesbian ).

CHIEF SORCERER IS :
Arkin hiSengele, 44, of Blue Sun.  He is 16th level.  His taste in women is 
expensive beyond his ability to manage his forest estates.  He is rumoured 
to be heavily into debt and to be seeking buyers for certain hunting areas.

There are few good sorcerers, most people travel to Jakalla to obtain 
anything above T5 Healing..

WEALTH:
K150,000 plus considerable estates of farms on the flood-plain.

MAJOR SOCIETIES ARE:
Sapphire Bough, blessers of crops. 27 members of this popular group, mostly 
low level sorcerers.

Wellspring of Life are traditionalists who hold that priests should not 
interfere in politics except to uphold the status quo. Berushme is a member.

Harmony in Blue are back to nature extremists. They seek to restore Tekumel 
to the 'primordial balance' before man interfered. (Their knowledge of the 
true history of the world is obviously poor !) The group are naturists and 
have retreats in the nearby lowland forests.

Dilinala

MEMBERS:
20

CHIEF PRIESTESS IS :
Suronqui hiDelonuash, 29, of Topaz Girdle clan. She is competent, ruthless 
and rich, as well as being exceptionally beautiful. Political leanings are 
not known, and she has taken no partners.

CHIEF SORCERER IS :
Suronqui again. There are few ( good ) magic users in this temple. 

WEALTH:
Despite persistant tales of potent technomagical items none have been seen. 
 The temple has evidence for K90,000 of liquid assets.

MAJOR SOCIETIES ARE:
Girdle of Purity, certainly zealots, possibly demonologists.  They include 
Suronqui who has personal links with the temple of Hrihiyal, although none 
can be traced to the group. 

Karakan

MEMBERS:
68

CHIEF PRIEST IS :
Kurrishmoi hiPejikhel, 58, Aridani of Blade Raised High. She rose to her 
current lofty position by a successful diplomatic carreer in the Palace of 
War. She is regarded as diplomatic and able.

CHIEF SORCERER IS :
Hirjan hiFashulara the 46 year old chief of Fist of Iron is 17th level.  He 
teaches children of noble clans but is rumoured to be a little greedy.  He 
is also a very capable warrior and was a champion athlete before he 
'settled down to a bit of mind bending'.  He strongly encourages magic and 
the temple can find a good range of T spells.

WEALTH:
K180,000 in ready assets, more in armour and arms.

MAJOR SOCIETIES ARE:
Rent Curtain.  These anti-Ksarul fanatics are frequently in trouble for 
their activities elsewhere in the Empire.  There could be one or two of 
them in the city.

Glorious in Scarlet, Imperialists and politickers.  Kurrishmoi and 39 
others are avowed members

Crimson Brothers have few members, they seek to propagate the (nearly 
heretical ) view that Karakan and Vimuhla have a closer relationship than 
current theology admits. This is a violent belief, which leads its 
followers into wild excursions in search of any scrap of proof that they 
are right.  Ancient tombs and old texts are a favourite target.

Chegarra

MEMBERS:
35 

CHIEF PRIEST IS :
Chaihellu hiSsanmirin, 49, of Sea Blue.  An active supporter of the Userper 
Eselne, he narrowly avoided impalement after the Rectification of the 
Emperors.  A 'bluff, honest soldier', his own description, he is famed for 
the number of shamtla cases he has had raised against him.  Since the 
Rectification of the Emperors he has conceived of a hatred of sorcery, and 
of Kashu hVorodu.

CHIEF SORCERER IS :
Vacant, and has been for two years.  Applicants should be prepared for 
disappointment.  The previous incumbent took his skills to Jaikalor, along 
with almost every talented mage over 11th level, following an ill-fated 
trip into the small underworld beneath the town.

WEALTH:
Only K25,000 declared on the last tax round. the temple is believed to owe 
large sums to the temple of Karakan.

MAJOR SOCIETIES ARE:
Glorious in Scarlet, 21 members

Ruby Hawk, a group of orators and publicists, have 4 people active in the 
area, they recount tales of glorious battles and assist in recruitment for 
Legions, thereby squeeking past the laws on proselitising.

a powerful socerer as well as a capable scholar.

CHIEF SORCERER IS :
Surprisingly the local temple lacks any declared ability to perform T level 
healing or allieviation, only G level known. They can repair Eyes and have 
a text on the subject. They buy any damaged items.

WEALTH:
They have recently spent large sums on new inner temples and repairs to 
their estates. Despite donations from influential foreigners they have only 
K15,000 in cash now.

[Moderator's Note:  The Professor responds to Adam's question about         ]
[                   Multi-planar-ness.                                      ]
 
>1.  The College of Ever-Living Wizards (Ever-Whizzing Lizards) is located

This is not certain. It is located at the end of time" on a plane that seems 
to be at the very apex of the Tree of Reality. This is the way it is phrased, 
but I have no idea whether this represents "reality" or is just a metaphor 
for the interplanar location of the College. This is not something I myself 
know -- I just deal with the College whenever it comes up in our games. I 
can't "explain" it.
 
>2.  Similarly, it is my understanding that a plane of the Mihalli exists 
>and that it was created by these beings a half-step removed from our plane.

The Mihalli do have a plane of their own (or many planes?). I don't think 
they "created" it necessarily, however. It may be that these are natural 
(?) planes along the Tree of Time and the Mihalli just happen to have 
adapted to living on it (them).

It's very hard to discuss all this -- this is not something I have ever 
worked out in detail.

>I was once called upon to travel back in time through nexus points located

Could happen. I have seen odder things. Did you get his name?

This is possible only for sorcerers of Thomar's level. Even then, he can't 
always be certain of success.

This is a possibility. The dynamics of other-planar space are extremely 
difficult, and it may not be possible to put them into neat rules that 
humans can comprehend. 
 
>For Thomar to perform magic in the above situation, I can see five likely

>1.   He had a device that acted as a magical battery

I doubt this one.

Possible...

>3.   He had found a way to magically insulate his Pedhetl (in this plane)

Doubtful. More likely he just had developed his talents over the centuries.

Possible. Hmm...

>5.   His Pedhetl was located on another plane making it immune to the

This is also possible. These solutions are all possible, of course, but I don't 
have a clue which one is correct -- if any. 

>It is this fifth option that I find the most intriguing.  Is it possible 
>for one or more of the bodies to exist on other planes and still be able

The Mihalli claim to do this. It is impossible for limited creatures such 
as we humans.

Again, possible but who knows? These are matters beyond the ken of humans 
who lack Thomar's experience and skills.

I wish I could be of more help, but I honestly do not know the answers to 
these and similar questions. My own interests on Tekumel have always tended 
towards the social, historical, anthropological stuff and not so much towards 
the underlying workings of the Planes Beyond.

Your theories are good ones. They are logical and fit well into the matrix. 
I have never thought out the ramifications of many of these ideas or tried 
to codify them. I am rather like a tourist who watches a snake-charmer: it 
sure is exciting to watch, but damnedifino how they do it!

As you may have noticed, Chris is collecting names for the Blueroom 
visitor book.
     
I have been corresponding with Chris and offered to prepare a survey of the 
player characters that we have.  ( I was dumb enough to suggest it in a 
message last month)

[Moderator's Note:  Great way to get volunteers!  :)                        ]
     
I would like to collect a little portfolio of the key characters that 
you have played over the years, and from this compile a sort of 
'Avanthar Debretts Nobility' or something similar to 'Who's Who In 
Tekumel'.

The product would be put on the ftp (or best WWW - if anyone prepared to 
take it?)in order that people could:

    i)   refer specific 'in game' questions to the appropriate character
    ii)  use us as 'archetypes' when in need of npc's
    iii) realise what a great place Tekumel is.
     
I promise to compile it, index it, and to spend an half an hour a week 
keeping it up to date for births, deaths and marriages.
     
Questions
     
1-Would you support an initiative along these lines?
     
2-Should I limit the characters to, say, three per person?
[Moderator's Note:  Keep in mind that there are ~70 people on the list.  Any ]
[                   more than say 1 per person for authentication would be   ]
[                   too much for the Professor to handle (That is my opinion ]

[                   many)  In any case, it will take time.                   ]
     
3-What other details would you like to see?

You all appear keen players, and have been pretty ready to offer advice and 
criticism, so I would value your help.

[Moderator's Note:  Wow!  Another of David Lemire's awesome articles on the  ]
[                   different martial arts of Tekumel.  Thanks a ton, David! ]

                        Yanaz Mittlamu

This third in the series of Blue Room articles on Tekumelani martial arts
explores the highly secret unarmed combat system taught in Livyanu,
mysterious land of the dread Shadow Gods. Yanaz Mittlamu is taught in five
principle styles, each similar to but also somewhat distinct from one
another, by the temples of Qame'el, Kirrineb, Guodai, Ru'ungkano, and
Kikumarsha. Only members of the Vru'uneb, that Livyani religious society
charged with enforcing the policies of the theocracy, today receive
instruction in the core techniques of Yanaz Mittlamu. Others, however, have
through the years picked up certain basics of the system through diffusion
down the security structure of Livyani society.
     Yanaz Mittlamu means, literally, "hand of destiny"; and, as its
meaning suggests, it is primarily a siezing and controlling art whose
techniques cause agony, numbness, sudden loss of consciousness, and even
death. At the hands of one Yanaz Mittlamu's masters, one is brought to his/
her final destiny -- be it arrest for later interrogation, torment, and
sacrifice; or simply death. The emphasis in Livyani unarmed combat arts on
close quarters striking, grappling, and take-downs, however, has developed
only recently (at least by Livyani standards!). Two thousand years ago,
before the region's many warring principalities were subsumed by the rise
of Livyanu's monolithic and theocractic state, unarmed combat arts closely
resembled a combination of Tsolyanu's two systems. Styles divided by
geographic region rather than by religion, however. In the south and west,
roughly below and beyond the Kanash, Li'uz, and Kapraz rivers, long range
kick-oriented styles dominated. In the north and east, through the heart of
Livyanu and across the Tlashte Heights, closer range strike-enter-grapple
styles held sway. Once Livyanu as we now know it arose (under the
semi-mythological Dumuz Melunez Chi'una), however, it was ordered that all
unarmed combat arts be brought under the perview of the dire Vru'uneb. This
had a profound effect. The styles were consolidated and those techniques
least useful to the Vru'uneb were abandoned, while those techniques most
helpful to the Vru'uneb and its multifarious missions were advanced and
systematically improved. Many kicks were abandoned (only low-line,
rapidfire, nerve destruction kicks remain). Several throws were dropped
(especially those designed to send the opponent sailing away from the
thrower). But almost all grappling skills designed to control or lock an
opponent's joints, muscles, and tendons were retained, reviewed, and
developed. Thus, two millenia later, Yanaz Mittlamu looks quite a bit
different than its distant ancesters.
     The purpose of Yanaz Mittlamu is to control and/or kill quickly. Its
grappling skills are designed to lock an opponent's joints or to tear his
muscles and tendons, destroy-ing his movement and his will to resist. Its
kicks, strikes, and jabs are used to numb an opponent's limbs, make him
lose consciousness, or even to kill him. All techniques cause extreme pain,
attack nerves and arteries, and exploit human physiology with the precision
of a high-circle surgeon. There are rumored to be over one-thousand Yanaz
Mittlamu techniques. They fall into five categories: 1) dividing the
muscle/tendon; 2) misplacing the bone; 3) sealing the breath; 4) sealing
the blood; 5) attacking the nexus (i.e., nerve center). Each of the temples
responsible for instruction in Yanaz Mittlamu specializes in one of these
categories of techniques, but by no means exclusively. They all know a
certain number of techniques in each category, enough to base and broaden
their distinctive styles, but have advanced knowledge in only one or two.
Dividing muscles, misplacing bones, and stopping an opponent's breathing
are relatively easy, external techniques which rely upon muscular strength,
physical agility, and practice for success. The Temples of Guodai and
Ru'ungkano specialize in these techniques. Techniques designed to collapse
an opponent's lungs, explode internal arteries, destroy important nerve
centers, or shock vital organs require a detailed knowledge of human
anatomy, the theory and timing of internal and other-planar energies, and
other esoteric sciences whose mastery takes years of patient application
under qualified tutors. The Temples of Kirrineb, Kikumarsha, and Qame'el
specialize in these rare, frightening techniques. Vru'uneb members chosen
for instruction in Yanaz Mittlamu begin with the easier, external
techniques usually, and advance to the more esoteric "internal" techniques
only if they demonstrate physical talent, psychic ability, and honor, which
in Livyanu means a total committment to the state and to the temples of the
Shadow Gods. If everything goes well, a student of Yanaz Mittlamu moves
from city to city, temple to temple, tutor to tutor as his/her mastery
grows. Some continue learning throughout their whole lives; others reach a
plateau and are then posted as espionage agents, interrogators, bodyguards,
ritual tormentors etc., depending upon their particular skills.
     Like both Hu'on and Dedaratl, Tsolyanu's unarmed combat arts, Yanaz
Mittlamu tends to be executed with a circular motion. This conserves energy
and enhances the element of surprise. Surprise is important. Only surprise
guarantees accurate joint, bone, artery, and nexus attacks. Witnesses
report that opponents often find themselves controlled before they even
realize they've been set up or angled for a technique. Also like martial
arts in Tsolyanu, training with and against weapons (i.e., weapon control/
disarming) is central to the teachings of Yanaz Mittlamu. The secret
masters of Yanaz Mittlamu stress, in their teaching texts (which resemble
ritual scriptures more than anything else), that versatility is essential
to victory in combat. How one acts depends upon how one's opponent reacts.
Criminals against the laws of the Shadow Gods are desperate! They refuse to
be controlled, so Vru'uneb officers and/or agents must adapt their Yanaz
Mittlamu to fit the situation. Often they feint or strike their victims
before applying a core Yanaz Mittlamu controlling technique. For example, a
technique called "Arm Engulfs the Dragon's Neck" involves striking at an
opponent's center. When this strike is blocked, the blocking wrist is
grabbed and pulled so that both its shoulder and elbow strain against the
puller's chest as the striking arm continues up, across, and around behind
the opponent's neck. This seals his breath, tears his shoulder, and breaks
his elbow. Another technique, called "Chi'inneb Extends Her Neck for Water"
involves striking at an opponent's abdomen. When this punch is blocked, the
right hand grabs the blocking wrist while the other arm snakes down under
the elbow and then quickly reverses up and foreward, over the upper arm,
locking the arm behind the opponent's back. The locked elbow is leveraged
higher to increase pain or prevent counters. The left hand is then free to
attack the near shoulder nexus, lift the victim's chin upward, tear his
neck tendon, or grab his hair to knee smash his face. Sometimes angling a
powerful or skilled opponent to apply a Yanaz Mittlamu control technique is
impossible, in which case kicks and strikes, aimed at causing
unconsciousness or even death, are used. These precision techniques are the
most demanding and feared in all Livyanu.
     Death blows which shock or destroy internal arteries and organs are
only taught to those persons in whom the Temples of the Shadow Gods place
incredible trust. A man can easily kill with one finger once he has
mastered the skills of sealing the breath, sealing the blood, and attacking
the nexus. These "advanced techniques" of Yanaz Mittlamu are taught in
highly ceremonial fashion, with the student getting the feel of the nexus
strikes or presses slowly, as though he were acting out some deeply
religious drama (often elaborate costumes and jeweled masks are worn, so as
to improve visual learning and remove mental blocks). Students recite
ritual verses which contain key concepts written with Kenemuz, whose
meanings provide insights into the deeper secrets of Yanaz Mittlamu. It is
up to the student to interpret them correctly, however. Concepts such as
"'ail", ascend, "shanz", break, and "'opu", seize, are examples. The
Temples of Kirrineb, Kikumarsha, and Qame'el routinely dedicate several
years when teaching these techniques; those of Guodai and Ru'ungkano spend
relatively less time because their advanced techniques are "external" and
therefore simpler. Students in all five temple-styles learn that there are
four general methods for controlling a person: to numb a part of his body,
to cause him to faint, to take away his breath, and to kill him. Numbing
part of a person's body involves striking nerve centers, utilizing either
external or internal power, causing paralysis and loss of function. Making
a person faint from pain also involves striking nerve centers, but usually
more vital ones closer to the spine, important organs, or the brain
(sometimes fainting can be produced while tearing tendons and breaking
bones, but only in cases of weak-willed individuals). Taking away a
person's breath is done in either of two ways: externally by damaging his
esophagus or carotid arteries (i.e., with a punch); internally by
collapsing his lungs with a deep nexus attack. Infinite are the ways in
which someone may kill a person: weapons, Onumish-poison placed beneath the
fingernails, or the secret death strikes of Yanaz Mittlamu. These involve
destroying internal organs through primary (the liver explodes), secondary
(the brain dies after strikes to the temple burst blood vessels), and
tertiary (the heart stops when a certain nexus lying along its meridian
gets hit hard) modes of attack. All advanced techniques target four general
areas of man's anatomy: the head, the spine, the nexus points, and the
internal organs. These attacks may be either direct or indirect, and their
effects immediate or delayed, depending on their target and the circulation
of bioelectrical energy through the body.
     Training methods for Yanaz Mittlamu's advanced techniques demand much
from those who would master them; they must develop highly detailed
esoteric knowledge and extremely powerful hands. Mind and body. The
original theory for these methods derive from "Li'ob Mikkul Shirudanaz"
(The Book of Becoming Shadow), which the Livyani claim was written 40,000
years ago. The practitioner must develop external penetration ability and
internal power. The first step, however, is to strengthen the hands and
fingers for striking with various weapons in a variety of forms (such as
the Secret Sword Hand). There are five stages in strengthening the hands:
finger push-ups, striking into kettles of raw beans, volcanic sand, and
then iron filings, and developing concentration, accuracy, impulse power,
and penetration. After extensive training a Yanaz Mittlamu master's fingers
resemble thin steel rods moving at great speed; no wonder such persons
cause extreme damage when hitting their target. Fantastic stories of
Livyani assassins killing their victims with a touch become more realistic
and less fantastic when one considers it often takes ten years to reach
this level of proficiency.
     The methods of developing internal power are too complex to be gone
into here, but they are similar to those used in sorcerous acadamies for
building psychic ability. They involve relaxed visualization leading to
high mental focus, physical movements initiating the generation and
concentration of energies, and then methods of channel-ling these energies
into various techniques, not all of which are strikes necessarily. A
different sort of energy is used to strike, to take down, and to grapple;
another sort is used to sense or perceive an opponent's momentum. Highly
skilled Yanaz Mittlamu practitioners can enter close combat in total
darkness, sense their opponents' moves while masking their own, and deliver
a death blow that destroys a nexus (the nerve center at the base of the
throat?) with precision and ease. Directing energies along the line of an
attack is a sure way to achieve deep bodily penetration; this is how
internal organs are destroyed. The spell "Missile of Metallja", which
launches a bolt of psychic force toward a target, is a phenomena related to
the applications of internal power described above, but it requires a
spell, is more powerful, and draws its energies partially from the Planes
Beyond. In Yanaz Mittlamu, internal power extends at the same time external
physical force is applied; it becomes instinctive and immediate and no
spell or other-planar energies are required. Nor do metals adversely affect
internal energies: one can wield steel weapons and still accomplish feats
of martial ardor. The non-psychic can achieve nearly the same results with
the right nexus attack, so Yanaz Mittlamu is an unarmed combat system
available to nearly everyone. Athletes tend to concentrate on those
techniques taught by the Temples of Guodai and Ru'ungkano. Esthetes tend
toward those techniques taught by the Temples of Kirrineb, Kikumarsha, and
Qame'el. Whichever one or combination of several styles a chosen agent of
the Vru'uneb pursues, the greatest glory of the dread Gods of Shadow is
served.


//150


Well, it seems fitting that this announcement falls on a milestone message
number.  This message, number 150, is an announcement of the first available
Internet released printings of Deeds of the Ever-Glorious.  It is available
on the Blue Room FTP site.  Deeds is a copyrighted work, and it is being 
released as shareware.  Please register by sending $5.00 (US) to the 
Professor via me,
Chris Davis
711 Pebbleshire Lane
St. Louis, MO  63122-5015

I will do the legwork of cashing checks and getting them to the Professor.

This work was brought to you by the Professor, of course, John Bailey 
(setnaffa@ix.netcom.com), who did the scanning, and yours truly, who did 
the editing.  Thanks a ton John, for all your work!  Deeds has been under 
construction since August, so this has been a major effort for us.  We will 
NOT be taking any of the registration fee, since we feel that any money 
should go to the creator of Tekumel.

The Mac 5.1 version is currently messing up on me, so I will release some-
thing as soon as possible on that front.
