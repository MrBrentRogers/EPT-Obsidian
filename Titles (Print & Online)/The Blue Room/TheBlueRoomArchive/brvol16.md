These messages are the accumulation of the messages that were sent out on 
the Blue Room email list between May 1995 and June 2000.  A large portion 
of the information is directly from Professor M.A.R Barker. When the list 
members joined during the time the list was active, they agreed to refrain 
from sharing this data with non list members.  When the list ended, it was 
urged that the data be made available to non-list Tekumel fans, and it 
seemed like a good idea all around.

I only ask that if you download these digests, or have received them in 
some other way, please respect the agreements the list members made, and 
refrain from passing them around and instead point people to the Tekumel 
web site, www.tekumel.com so that they can download them for themselves, 
and see all the other material available on the Tekumel.com web site.

Many Thanks.

The sections about cannibalism and also about sexuality (some of which
overlap) (is that a pun?) have already been written into Mitlanyal.

As an update, all _content_ has now been incorporated into Mitlanyal.  The
book consists of twenty-four chapters:  four introductory chapters (three
of which are rather small, one-page or so), and one chapter for each deity.
Of these, the four introductory chapters have been finished, as have
Hnalla, Dra, and Avanthe.  By finished I mean finished-finished -- no
further reformatting or changes will be made prior to publication, save for
typographical errors.

Yes, this is true. It is aberrant, however, and not a regular part of 
Pijjenani society.

This is absolutely true. Tsa'avtulgu is a very nasty piece of work. Only 
one player party has ever visited there, and they got out at the first 
opportunity.  I don't recall if any of my current players were in that 
adventure or not, but if so, they may want to comment.

This was the captives' fear, not necessarily the reality. The siege of 
Pu'er was *very* aberrant, even for Sarku devotees.  Dhich'une and the 
High Command had the general impaled who brought out the Undead there. 
The Undead were swiftly boxed up and shipped off to the City of Sarku, 
and now everybody denies everything.  In fact, Dhich'une has been rather 
obedient to Tsolyani laws and customs, although the invasion force that 
broke into the cellars of Avanthar last year were repelled by chaps who 
did not seem to enjoy the light of day...

There are penty of "barbaric" cultures that never employed cannibalism, 
however: the Norse, for example.  There are "pacifistic" cultures and 
"warlike" cultures where cannibalism was used from time to time, almost 
always for ritualistic purposes and not for gustatory enjoyment!

Yes, see above.

Not that any Livyani will admit.

Bob Alberti has had rather a hard time ferreting out the inner workings 
of the Livyani sects.  They are not forthcoming about their beliefs and 
practices, and he may have to describe only what he can see "over the 
top of the wall," as the Livyani put it.  His first volume (over 300 pages) 
is almost done now, and it covers only the Tsolyani deities, practices, etc.

This is probable. In spite of some very chaste language, "Mitlanyal" may 
not be acceptable to the Puritans out there. Tome will have to decide 
whether it wants to print the book or let Bob find other funding.

[Moderator's Note:  Peter Bismire asks about the history of Ghaton.         ]

>While we've seen the language, social mores and clothing of Ghaton covered 
>I'm intrigued to know a little more about its history.

Ghaton appears to have been a splinter state, breaking off quite early 
from the Empire of the Dragon Warriors (the Flame-worshipping tribesmen 
from the far northwest). During Bednalljan times there is little 
information, except that the region was "pacified" by one of the later 
Emperors.  The Engsvanyali conquered Ghaton and strove to turn it into a 
province where the deities of Pavar would be worshipped -- and where the 
social mores would be more in line with those of the Engsvanyali. The 
Ghatoni did not agree, apparently, and their society became even more 
insular and hostile to the distant Priestkings. The place was conquered 
and reduced almost to abject slavery and poverty by one of the Empresses 
(I think it was Tratikante, but I'd better check). The Ghatoni then 
retreated into their mountain fastnesses and refused to pay taxes, send 
recruits to the legions, or acknowledge any other obligation to the 
Engsvanyali. The latter garrisoned Ghaton City, built a poor-quality 
version of a Sakbe road that went along the coast, north and around to 
Mu'ugalayva and to N'luss. This has since fallen into complete ruin.

The Ghatoni attitude towards women does not seem to stem directly from 
their revolt against the Engsvanyali (whose employment of women in high 
posts is proverbial). They seem to have had this same mind-set since 
Bednalljan times, at least, and their tribal laws reinforce it. They are 
now cut off by their odd mores, quite aberrant, and thoroughly insular.

>I presume that it was a fairly standard province during Engsvan hla Ganga 
>(thin ice I know :)) and developed in isolation during the Time of No Kings 
>similarly to Lorun matriarchy. Is this right?

During the Time of No Kings, the Ghatoni did very little that is now 
known. They maintained their hostility to the matriarchal Yan Koryani 
throughout the early centuries of the Second Imperium but softened enough 
to send a small contingent of troops (and their specially trained 
Serudla!) to aid the Baron during the recent conflict with Tsolyanu -- 
either that or join the Mu'ugalavyani, whom they also despise, or the 
Tsolyani, whom they see as just another Engsvanyali offshoot. They are 
indeed a strange society.

>Am I also correct that the Ghatoni are themselves incredibly insular 
>allowing foreign (male) merchants in but not venturing out themselves lest 
>their sensibilities be offended?

Here you are correct, except that occasional delegations and mercantile 
emissaries do come out, staying aloof and dealing strictly with business, 
then returing. Very few Ghatoni ever seem to switch over to Tsolyani 
attitudes, although they do seem occasionally to study their neighbours.

[                   on his campaign idea.                                   ]

>Do you know any information about The Ruins of N'gala, (near  Jakalla)?

The place used to be on dry land before Ganga sank and left the ruins a 
swamp. It is said that Queen Nayari of the Bednalljan Dynasty used to 
disport herself there, and that there were pleasures and palaces and 
beautiful things aplenty. Now all of this is gone, and the swamps have 
taken over. There is a little dry land upon which some of the taller 
buildings still stand, but most of the old city is now under 10 feet or 
so of very dangerous water (many critters, diseases, molds, blights, and 
icky things). It is hard to reach, even though Jakalla is not far away: 
the water is too shallow for most ships, and small boats have a way of 
disappearing in the shadowy, foggy jungles. Still we have had parties 
across there, exploring. Not all of them returned.

>Do you know anything about "He Who Has No Tail"?
>I was thinking to have an adventure based on "He Who Has No Tail". 
>The original rule book said "the curious city of Hmakuyal (hex  
>3708)  where dwells He Who Has No Tail, the subject of many ancient
>and terrible legends;"

Hmakuyal is really much better known and populated than Ngala. The 
priesthood of Ksarul occupies Hmakuyal, and there are shrines, hostels 
for pilgrims, and all sorts of Ksarul-oriented businesses there 
(amulet-makers, sellers of religious documents, artists and sculptors, 
makers of sacrificial offering statues, and lots of others). The city 
is a semicircular volcanic crater, and most of the important shrines 
are buried in caverns beneath the crater walls, while the hostels, etc. 
occupy the centre of the crater floor. Inside one of the oldest and 
deepest shrines, it is said, the beast Without a Tail accepts sacrifices 
and offerings. See the "Book of Ebon Bindings."

>>Seems like he/she/it formed the Milumanayanan Desert and might've had 
>>something to do with Hrugga and the Egg of the World.

The legends don't say that the Beast had anything to do with the Desert
-- that came about when Ganga sank, and the low-lying central plains of 
what is now Yan Kor rose. The Beast is indeed found in the Legend of 
Hrugga, though not in direct connection with the Egg of the World.

>The way it would start is by one of the players eating a basketball

Hmm. Never saw one of those... You're welcome to introduce it as a 
"special," though.

I don't recall many canals or pools of any size in Hmakuyal. ??? The 
place is a little arid, though not really desert. Try just subterranean 
tunnels in the crater wall.

>At this main pool is "He Who Has No Tail".  At random times once

Try having the Beast chase a worshipper round and round in one of the 
labyrinthine tunnels that surround the central shrine.  This is going 
to surprise a lot of priests there, since their idea of a good ritual 
is pretty solemn and dark and rather awesome. They'll be really shocked 
and amused to see some poor sacrifice come larruping by, fleeing the 
Beast! But it's a sort of fun idea.

All sounds a bit elaborate, but if the referee sets the stage and plays 
it right, it ought to be fun.

>[Moderator's Note:  Once a month seems a bit excessive to me.                 

Not at all. *I* personally eat at least one egg a week.
[Moderator's Note:  Yes, so do I, but we don't eat basketball sized ones!  ]

That is correct.

Give it a try and see how your players enjoy it. Some players do not like 
being "locked" into an adventure, but I do this to my group(s) all the 
time. It's sometimes the only way to get people to play actively. As long 
as the pressures are not too excessive and too unpleasant, this sort of 
adventure can be very enjoyable.

Hello everyone, I'm back from the hinterlands of unemployment, having today
accepted a new position that pays a lot more than my last position.

For the convention I sent in two entries:  a serious game of Tsolyani
intrigue I called "Mitlanyal: The Game," and a comical romp through the
Jakallan underworld with co-GM Keith Dalluhn called "Jakalla the Wild."

Everyone on the list should consider signing up, and writing an encouraging
letter to David Cheng (cheng@io.com) along the way!

they will all be role-playing events, and I plan on at least one being a

I've also volunteered to moderate two seminars -- one on Tsolyani law, and one

This is one of those questions to which there is no fixed answer. The 
Sarku priests give a reply directly contrary to that of the Belkhanu 
theologians, etc.

>The source books hold that "the Engsvanyali theologians state that every
>living entity consists of five parts or "selves," each of which has a
>separate identity and a certain degree of independence from the rest."

>Later on they state that "Sarku focusses upon the Mind here in this Plane,

>The sources state further that, upon death, the Shadow-Self dies, the Mind
>hovers near the body, the Pedhetl returns to the sea of force, and the 
>Spirit-Soul journeys on to the Isles of the Excellent Dead.  

>My question is, perhaps, obvious.  If a Sarku worshipper, or, for that
>matter, anyone else, is revived as an Undead, what happens to the "unclaimed"
>Spirit-Soul?  Does it continue upon its journey?

Lord Sarku is said to send these spirit-souls directly on their journey 
to the Isles of Teretane. The spirit-soul no longer plays a part in the 
intellect's existence. These portions of the total being are thus 
separated forever. Some Sarku priests say that "disconnected" spirit-souls 
wander forever, others have it that they live on for awhile and then 
perish. If you revive an entity as Undead, the unneeded parts then 
apparently go their way. All of this is rather murky and fraught with 
controversy between the various sects and temples.
 
>More practically, could you converse with that Spirit-Soul while the
>"actual" person is walking around with its Mind in its Body?  Or is a 
>Sarku worshipper like a Gloranthan vampire, someone who has sacrificed his
>"immortal soul" in return for unlife in "this" existence?  

Theoretically you cannot contact a spirit-soul who has gone away on the 
Journey.  The spirit-soul is now unimportant to the person, who focusses 
upon the existence of the Intellect.

I have no idea what a "Gloranthan vampire" is. What part of Tekumel do 
they inhabit?

>A related question:  do demons that "eat your soul" eat all 4 parts of it

The Great Demons tend to consume the spirit-soul, as well as the body and 
the Intellect. The shadow-self is said to die on its own, when it is 
separated from the other parts. The Pedhetl is eaten to provide energy and 
substance to the Demon. The Unending Grey takes away the whole package: 
all of the parts!

[Moderator's Note:  Dermot Bolton asks about Psychic vs Ritual magic, and how]
[                   "wild" sorcerors are handled in the Five Empires.        ]

This is a difficult question since the basis for Tekumelani sorcery is rather 
different from Terran (particularly European) sorcery.

>Psychic powers

Both ritual maic and psychic magic have to do with establishing "gestalts" 
or images of the Planes Beyond, then setting up conduits through which 
power can flow from those Planes into Tekumel's, then moulding that power 
into substance and/or energy according to ancient models. Psychic magic 
works by using templates within the mind alone; ritual magic eases the 
way with objects, vocables, rituals, etc. Both really do the same thing, 
but ritual magic requires more equipment.

>Many of the spells available for psychic sorcerers equate to perceived

What is a "sorc?" Sort of an "orc?" :-)

>The first question is do psychic sorcs channel other planar energies like
>ritual sorcs or do they use their own power?

They channel Other Planar energy by setting up pictures of the Other Planar 
landscape in their minds, then setting up connectors and conduits. This is
done automatically by the spells of ritual magic.

Such individuals occur rarely. It is possible that in remote areas they 
may be overlooked, but magic causes "waves" on the psychic landscape, and 
they are usually detected at young ages when they accidentally contact 
their psychic power sources in an undisciplined way. The priests then 
arrive and confiscate the kid, usually paying the parents Shamtla for 
him/her. In truly dangerous cases, when the psychic talent is really 
undisciplined and awesome, the little rascal may be "offed" by sorcerers 
of considerable status. This is not common, since most such "wild talent" 
is low-level (at the stage of spoon-bending), and most parents are happy 
to see their young sprout enrolled in a prestigious temple school where 
the rigorous training soon turns him/her into a well-disciplined 
practitioner.

Phil

Both ritual maic and psychic magic have to do with establishing "gestalts" 
or images of the Planes Beyond, then setting up conduits through which 
power can flow from those Planes into Tekumel's, then moulding that power 
into substance and/or energy according to ancient models. Psychic magic 
works by using templates within the mind alone; ritual magic eases the 
way with objects, vocables, rituals, etc. Both really do the same thing, 
but ritual magic requires more equipment.

What is a "sorc?" Sort of an "orc?" :-)

They channel Other Planar energy by setting up pictures of the Other Planar 
landscape in their minds, then setting up connectors and conduits. This is
done automatically by the spells of ritual magic.

Such individuals occur rarely. It is possible that in remote areas they 
may be overlooked, but magic causes "waves" on the psychic landscape, and 
they are usually detected at young ages when they accidentally contact 
their psychic power sources in an undisciplined way. The priests then 
arrive and confiscate the kid, usually paying the parents Shamtla for 
him/her. In truly dangerous cases, when the psychic talent is really 
undisciplined and awesome, the little rascal may be "offed" by sorcerers 
of considerable status. This is not common, since most such "wild talent" 
is low-level (at the stage of spoon-bending), and most parents are happy 
to see their young sprout enrolled in a prestigious temple school where 
the rigorous training soon turns him/her into a well-disciplined 
practitioner.

[Moderator's Note:  Gordon Neff asks about the Shunned Ones.              ]

This question, like some of those previously put forward, demands more 
"knowledge" than I really have. It is one of those "tell us about the 
political parties in Ssuyal" questions, when I have always stated that 
I myself know nothing beyond what I can learn about Tekumel from 
Tekumelani informants. It's like the wargamer who becomes annoyed by 
the fact that I cannot tell where a certain legion is, who is its 
general, how many troops it has, or whom it is supporting currently. 
All of these sorts of questions demand a god-like overview (the 
"Wargamer's Inimitable Eye"). I see Tekumel as a very real place, with 
inconsistencies, deceptions, etc. that I myself cannot solve. It's 
more fun.

>I would ask similar questions about the Shunned Ones. They've always
>intrigued me, living as they do in sealed, domed cities. Why do they ever 
>leave
>those cities?

The Yan Koryani who have kept an eye on the Shunned Ones for generations 
say that, as far as can be known, the Shunned Ones need various metals 
and chemicals, plus fuel cells and small powered machines. They do not 
send out parties often, but they do make long and rather daring trips 
by the tubeway cars. They do not use the Patterns and the Nexus Points 
as often.

>For that matter, are those in fact the -same- cities, existing for
>millenia?

We think so. 

>Could they still build new ones, if they needed to? Have they ever 
>lost a city to structural failure of its dome?

Yes. There is a rather small, shattered dome in hex 5928 of the old 
Zocchi map. There is also the "walled ruin" in hex 6129, which is 
assumed -- and only assumed -- to be of Shunned Ones origin. Entering 
these places requires existing on your own in that barren, blasted 
landscape for longer than most people can stand. The Shunned Ones may 
have detection devices, too, because they almost always seem to appear 
to challenge any "visitors." Only one or two successful "visits" have 
ever made it back...

>I've never felt them to be 'hostile' in the same league as the Ssu and
>the Hluss-- they're just edgy, and understandably so. Prickly, bristling
>defensiveness is literally 'a matter of life and breath...'

Okay. Next time *YOU* go talk to them! They tend to attack first and 
converse later. They may not be innately, ethically, or whatever hostile, 
but those who attempt to chat with them end up just as dead. Racial 
paranoia? Maybe we smell bad to them?

I don't, actually, think I'm the first, nor certainly the only one, to
reply to that, if Phil were interested, but Mr Chapin was referring to 
the 'Runequest' gaming system and its associated world, Glorantha, which 
has its own particular 'take' on vampires.

I'd have to dig it out of its storage box to be more specific, but it's
pretty much what he said; they reflected the traditional 'damned' legends 
within their own cultural/religious framework fairly adroitly.

(Personally, I've always seen a certain merit to being a vampire on 
Tekumel; in a culture where nothing really COUNTS for much until it's 
reached it's first thousand years of age, 'three score and ten' is just 
may-fly league.  If'n you ain't got -serious- longevity, fergit it.)

I am very sorry to announce that Tekumel-Con is cancelled.

Professor Barker has recently told us that he is no longer able to
commit to attending, for personal reasons.  Given that he was our
single and most important Guest of Honor, we have to be realistic about how
many potential attendees we would lose given this turn of events.  Since
our expected attendance was never high to begin with, we have decided to
cut our losses and cancel the convention.

Please note, however, that this was not an all-or-nothing decision.
Progress toward the con never really achieved "good momentum": the response
to the postcard survey was disappointing; the number of GM volunteers was
low; the number of events submitted, even after an emergency appeal, was
too low.

This is not to say that certain individuals lacked enthusiasm.  We
appreciate the volunteers who came forward and offered to run events all
weekend.  Unfortunately, there were just too few of you to carry the con,
and not enough people offered to run just one or two.

It was our (stated) intention that Tekumel-Con would be an event worth
planning a whole vacation around.  Some of you have contacted me to say you
were doing just this.  Our most sincere apologies go out to you.  We hope
this cancellation will not cost you too much money or otherwise taint your
other vacation plans.

News of the cancellation will only be spread electronically.  Please help
us out by informing anyone not online that might have been planning to
attend.

Please do not email me to ask about specific con issues, especially as they
relate to Professor Barker.  Any such emails will not be answered.

If any of you would like to try to organize your own Tekumel-Con at some
time in the future, please be sure to contact me.  I will be happy to hand
over to you the work I've done so far.

Again, our apologies to those of you who were truly supportive.

Mental illness is usually kept within the household of the clan to which
the patient belongs. Irrational behaviour is clearly different from
culturally patterned behaviour: a man who takes a knife and goes up and
down a street stabbing passersby is obviously different from one who has a
hair-trigger temper and go about slitting gullets of those who offend him.
The former would be automatically imprisoned by the city guards (road
guards, OAL -- whoever), and if his clan did not intervene and pay Shamtla,
he would probably be offed in some simple and not very painful fashion. The
latter person might be sued for Shamtla by his victims' relations, who
might also ask for the death penalty.

Really raving mental illness gets the patient incarcerated in a room
somewhere in his clanhouse, usually dark and austere but not cruel. If he
has to be restrained, this is done with as much kindness as possible --
after all, the patient is a clan brother.

It is hard to mark the borderline between eccentricity and madness. It
partially depends on whether the patient has more political/social clout
than the victim!  A high-clan, high-status person could simply kill a
low-clan, low-status madman and pay a little Shamtla. Reversed, the
situation would be different.

The borderline between madness and eccentricity thus lies pretty much in
the eye of the beholder.

A harmless madman may be free to wander about, begging, haranguing,
performing antisocial acts, etc. followed by gangs of children who pelt him
with excrement, dead rodents, and other delights. I remember the case of
Elara hiVriddi's brother, whose nickname was Daju (nobody ever recalled his
real name). He wandered around Purdimal, stark naked, begging fruit peels
from the passersby. I have since lost track of him -- he may be dead now.

If you suspect that a person's motivations stem from mental illness, rather
than from reasonable anger, etc., you can approach that person's clan and
see if they are aware of him. They may then be willing to take action and
incarcerate him, rather than get into an inter-clan squabble.

Phil

There may be a smell component to the fear engendered by the Ssu and he
Shunned Ones. Quite possible. I have had human players react to a
sprinkling of cinnamon as though they had been stabbed -- just a carry-over
from the game. I don't doubt that the dreadful sulphur (plus other
unpleasant ingredients) smell of the Shunned Ones' cities would make
anybody cough, choke, and feel terror. Odour and possible emissions of
chemicals that transmit fear are thus a good possibility.

>PS. EPT says that the Shunned Ones are on old race even by Ssu 
>standards; can this be elaborated on? Are the Shunned Ones truly 
>Tekumel's oldest race, and are they indigenous or alien to the planet?

The appearance of the Shunned Ones is supposed to go back to pre-human
times. How this is known is problematic, but it is part of the corpus of
legends about these creatures: "many ages older than the Ssu" is an epithet
for them. In point of fact, they may very well have arrived and settled
remote regions of the planet while the Ssu and the Hluss inhabited other
locales. Neither the Ssu nor the Hluss would have particularly wanted the
areas preferred by the Shunned Ones, and neither race is especially given
to exploration or to the acquisition of geographic knowledge, The Shunned
Ones might thus have gone undetected -- or just ignored -- for millennia.

[Moderator's Note:  David Allan asks about the relationships between the   ]
[                   worshippers of Hrsh.                                   ]

>How did two groups as different as the rulers of Mu'uglavya and the half
>human Fungus Eaters become coreligionists in the seemigly very exclusive
>cult of Hrsh?

Hrsh is a state cult deity; his worship contains all sorts of elements and
strands.  The Mu'ugalavyani have built him into a semi-copy of Vimuhla, who
they can't fully and wholeheartedly accept because Vimuhla is part of a
*foreign* pantheon (Pavar -- who lived in Ganga, in what is now Tsolyanu).

Hrsh's sect includes simple doctrines for uneducated folk (the Fungus
Eaters) and exceedingly sophisticated theology for the scholars in
Ssa'atis. Rather like the tribal people of India, who pour milk over a
stone painted red: Siva, in a field to ensure crop fertility, versus the
pedantic and subtle Brahmans of Benares. These two extremes lie only a few
miles from one another. Philosophical Hindu scholars state that the
polytheism of the temples can be reduced to a trinity (Siva, Vishnu, and
Brahma) and thence to One. The priests of Hrsh might well say something
similar, although they have never had to rationalise or apologise for their
beliefs to a colonial power (as the people of India did for years to the
British and now to the combined influences of the West).

One might also compare the snake-handlers and other variant Christian sects
in this country to the educated preachers in college divinity schools.

On Tekumel, social differences exist that may not make sense at first
glance, but look at the history and other factors.

I am not up on orbits and astronomy, so my answers to Mr. Grandidge may be
off by a country mile!

He is correct about the two moons, big Gayel and smaller Kashi, about their
colours (green, red), about their orbits. There does seem to be some slight
difference between the perfect 30-day and 15-day orbits stated in
Tekumelani texts, however. I do not think that these moons lie exactly on
the plane of the ecliptic since Kashi appears to be several degrees higher
in the sky, right above Gayel, and one moon elipsing the other is something
I have never seen -- though it may occur. Kashi "rushes past" like the
bright Flame," to quote from the Engsvanyali poet Yetil, while Gayel
"glides with slow and slumberous grace, as befits Lady Dlamelish."

>Also, for each phase of Kashi, there will be a corresponding phase of Gayel,

The orbits were established by the first terraformers, but they have
drifted over the millennia,and now the two moons are no longer in sync.

Wish I could help more. All I do is report what I see, and Kashi and Gayel
are both frequent together in the night sky. Anybody who wants to play with
astronomy is welcome to give it a try.

[Moderator's Note:  Bob Alberti follows up on the Mental Illness topic.      ]

As a followup regarding mental illness, there are several Stability Temples
which take care of those of the mentally ill whose clan is unknown, or cannot
support them.  The Staff of Mercy Society of the Temple of Ketengku maintains
a facility near Thraya which is actually quite nice, and is dedicated to the
care of the mentally ill.  Which reminds me, I haven't been there to visit
Lord Sanjesh in OH so long...

Aside from Ketengku, the Temples of Avanthe and Dilinala operate hospitals,
and some of the larger of these, in Hauma and Bey Su, can care for the
mentally ill for brief periods, but are not set up for long-term care of 
that kind.  This care is for at most several months duration, while the clan
comes up with some means of caring for the individual.

If you'll recall from Man of Gold, Harsan found himself dispensed eventually
to the tender mercies of slavers, a common fate for the "functionally"
mentally ill.  The learning disabled, those with brain injuries who can
still work, etc, my find themselves scrubbing floors, toting bales and
cleaning stables.

If that seems cruel, just look at American policy towards the mentally ill,
the quality of our institutions, and the persons with Down's syndrome and 
learning disabilities one finds washing dishes in cafeterias and working
at McDonalds.  My brother is one such.  Granted the Tsolyani don't have
the Special Olympics, but maybe they don't feel the need to ameliorate
cultural guilt with public pageantry the way we do.

[Moderator's Note:  Jamie Norrish asks about other types of mental instabil-]
[                   ity and how they are handled on Tekumel.                ]

>While the posts on this matter have been interesting, I'd love to
>learn more about attitudes towards those with mental illnesses which
>don't result in homicidal rages and/or lack of mental functionality.
>Would someone who was known to be schizophrenic be allowed to take
>important roles?

It is hard to stop someone who comes from a rich and powerful clan or has 
a traditional role in society from taking his/her post, crazy or not.
Examples from our world include King Ludwig of Bavaria, Caligula, and other
"toons." Tekumel is much the same here: unless the patient is really
incapacitated and unable to function at all, chances are that the society
will let him/her fill the post and perform whatever functions are possible
-- while keepng him/her surrounded with servants, chamberlains (= guards),
and more levelheaded "counsellors." A good example is the Mad King of
Salarvya, who has to be protcted by an official "regent" from doing really
ugly things. The old king is permitted to play in his walled garden in
Tsatsayagga, riding around in his golden chariot, pulled by squads of naked
girl-children (whom he doesn't seem to harm otherwise). Sometimes he tells
people he is a god, at other times he hides beneath the throne and
whimpers. He is, however, able to function to the extent that Duke
Zhurrilugga, the Regent, can get a signature out of him.

>Would someone who had multiple personalities be
>shunned as freakish, just because of that fact?

Depends how disfunctional the person is. Chances are that he would be
unable to maintain much personal continuity, and his clansmen, priests,
etc. would declare him to be inhabited by demons. There is no "heresy,"
however, and he would thus not be tried as a witch or burnt at the stake.
If he can function at some level or other, he will be allowed to live out
his life as a "funny uncle" in his clanhouse -- preferably a back room in a
rural branch, of course. If his several personalities were consistent
enough, the priesthoods might declare him to be possessed by several
"spirit-souls" and thus someone with special knowledge. The Empire has
various soothsayers, oracles, and fortune-tellers who are quite probably
delusional, but as long as they don't speak or act against the established
doctrines of the priesthoods and the Imperium, they are allowed to fill
these roles. If they do go against society in some visible and dangerous
way, they may well be quietly "offed," unless they can be defused by
locking them up in a remote prison cell, or some such solution.

>Which leads me also to ask how people "hearing voices" may be
>interpreted by different folk, whatever the actual reason may be.

These exist, as mentioned above. Hearing voices may be interpreted as
multiple spirit-souls; if a patient hears one or more of the Gods, he may
be visited by a squad of priestly philosopher-physicians, who will try to
interpret his behaviour. In most cases, the "voices" are not consistent
enough and have no real secrets to reveal -- memories of divine actions at
the Battle of Dormoron Plain, for exmaple, and the patient's claims are
rejected. In almost all cases, he/she ends up in a back room in the
clanhouse; wealthy victims receive better treatment and are "retired" to a
mansion on a country estate; those who are very poor and not lucky enough
to be taken in by one of the hospices referred to in a previous post,
wander the streets, begging, declaiming, and picking through offal for
food. These unfortunates are often victimised by neighbours and passersby.
Sometimes they are ridiculed, driven away, or even stoned if they are
obnoxious. They are not sacrificed, of course, since the Gods require
healthy victims.

Occasional deliberate deception is often investigated. With various
truth-telling spells available, it is hard to pretend to be insane if one
is not. I am reminded of a Yan Koryani officer who was captured during the
recent war; he pretended to have been struck on the head with a weapon in
battle and reduced to babbling insanity. Somehow the usual spells did not
work on him, but the priesthoods were suspicious. Lord Ksarul's clergy
arranged for a child to be given the appearance of the man's son in Yan
Kor, pretending that the boy had been captured when the city of Grai fell.
They brought the child to a holding cell near the one occupied by the
"madman." The officer at once offered to be sacrificed instead of his son
-- an offer the Tsolyani immediately accepted, and so it was done.

The system is far from perfect (as on this world as well!), and mistakes
and mis-diagnoses are common. It's all in "the luck of the draw."

[Moderator's Note:  Peter Bismire offers up a treatise on Archery on Tekumel.]
[                   The Professor sprinkled in some comments on his work.    ]

  = Peter's article.

>Not much left for me to say. Peter has put the pieces together well. I 
>looked for mistakes and for things I can add but did not see many of 
>either.

Archery in Tsolyanu:

While in Jakalla recently I had the good fortune to meet Muresh hiPagartra
a former Molkar in the legion of Girikteshmu, 23rd Imperial Archers. Lord 
Muresh is best described as an enthusiastic archer and collector of archery
equipment from Tsolyanu and foreign lands. The following are notes I made 
while talking with him and can only apologise if I have incorrectly
recorded the details he supplied.

>Muresh tends to be a bit over-enthusiastic when talking about archery. If 
>you listen to him, most of the great victories in Tsolyani history are due 
>to some famous archer or other. Pikemen, swordsmen, etc. are just like the 
>extras in a DeMille movie: there for the colour.

"Archery is a noble accomplishment and has a long lineage going back to the
Gods. At the Battle of Dormoron Plain Karakan Himself chose to oppose the 
Wanderers Between the Worlds in his Aspect of Mrachinra armed with a bow
which had two tips of red ruby, limbs of green chrysolite, a grip of white
pearl and a string of red gold. Her arrows were of topaz, fletched with
emeralds and their heads were of sapphire. As the enemy approached She
nocked and fired in one smooth movement time after time never letting her 
eyes stray from their advance. With each arrow tens of the adversaries fell
until their mighty legion withered away to nothing."

>You should compare some of the other versions of this episode!

"The use of missile weapons in the armies of Tsolyanu is based on two
separate tactics. The specific missile legions are intended to harass and 
damage the enemy at a distance where they are unable to respond. Thus the 
archer legions use bows that are capable of throwing a lighter arrow a
great distance. By contrast those cohorts of line legions that are equipped
with missiles role is to disorganise the enemies line just before contact.
Consequently their bows are shorter but of heavier manufacture, capable of
giving their heavy arrows a greater force capable of piercing armour and
helmets."

>Correct.

"Some legions substitute throwing clubs (Legion of the Givers of Sorrow) or
bolas (Legion of Heketh of Purdimal). These are intended to entangle the
legs of the approaching enemy (bolas and clubs used underarm or be thrown 
over the fighting line into the enemies rear ranks (bolas). "

"In Tsolyanu crossbows and handbows are regarded equally. In Livyanu, Yan 
Kor, Salarvya, Saa Allaqi and the smaller nations of the north the handbow
has a greater appeal. In Mu'ugalavya the crossbow has a slight ascendancy."

>Economic and technological reasons, probably.

"One of the Mu'galavyani legions (Legion IX of the Fourth Palace, "Dune
Leapers") use a type of small repeating crossbow. This is designed to fire
two quarrels of reed at a time, which due to their lightness are poisoned.
It has a handle which when worked back and forth automatically draws back 
the string, loads two quarrels and shoots the weapon. I do not know where 
these are made."

>They used to have a factory in Gaschne, but I haven't ever seen it.

"Among the Kurtani each village has a master bowyer who is also responsible
for the training of young boys. From the age of about six no Kurtani
youngster seems to be without a bow in his hand. On the edge of the village
they erect two poles with a small ring between them. A child must be able 
to shoot an arrow through this ring before he can eat his evening meal. As
they get older the distance from which they are allowed to shoot increases.

>True. Lots of hard work and practice. Poor shots and kids with weak eyesight
>tend to become very skinny.

Only Kurtani are allowed to harvest Seresh wood for bows and each village 
jealously guards its groves from their neighbours. Any intruders into their
hills who damages a Seresh tree is likely to be used for archery practice 
and I can count on one hand the times I have seen a Kurtani not hit his
mark squarely.

The Seresh tree is slow growing and their ancestors planted the trees they
harvest several hundred years ago. Thus when they harvest a tree they will
plant seedlings to replace it and creatures of the forest that are liable 
to damage the young plants are hunted ruthlessly in the vicinity.

>The swamps around Purdimal also produce a related species of Seresh-wood. 
>It is not quite as good as the Kurtani variety. Ssar-wood is also a common 
>product of the swamps there.

The wood is harvested during the month of Langala and bow-staves are cut
from the trunk. These are straight, one and a half dhaiba in length and
four choptsekh thick. Great care is taken in ensuring that the proper
proportion is kept between the outerwood and the heartwood so that the 
bow will be of the best. Once cut the staves are bound in bundles of ten 
and allowed to season for several years in a special hut in the village. 
Unlike most Kurtani building this is not dug into the ground but raised 
on piles allowing air to circulate. The hut and piles are sprayed with 
various plant concoctions that repel wood-eating funguses and borer-Shqa. 
The only entrance is reached by a curious style of ladder which is a log 
with steps cut into it.

When seasoned the bowyer using a wide range of tools shapes the stave. 
The Kurtani seem to make a point not to use much metal in their common 
lives retaining what they have for decoration and ornament. The bowyer's 
tools thus are local in origin and normally made by the man himself. Some 
shaping knives and similar are made from Chlen hide but the teeth and 
bones from animals such as Zrne and Tsi'il are mainly used. This is one 
of the reasons that Kurtani seem so eager to help visiting hunters as 
Tsolyani not only pay but also don't appreciate useful articles such as 
these and the Kurtani can help themselves. 

When finally shaped a Kurtani bow is a thing of beauty the contrast 
between the two types of wood is usually enhanced by coating with a 
home-made varnish (not Ssun) and polishing using a piece of Vringalu-
leather. Of an evening you will find the Kurtani sitting around their 
fires polishing their bows."

"Arrow heads can be made of many things. I have heard that the nomads of
Milumanaya use the discarded (?) teeth of the Great Aya as heads for their
arrows. These are made from a length of reed, I do not know where they get
these, with nocks and forepart made from the wood of some hardy desert
shrub. Into the forepart they set one of these teeth. (Lord Muresh then
showed me one of these in his collection. It was about 30inches long with 
the back 18 inches some sort of dark red reed. The next 6 inches was a
heavy black type of wood and the front a lethal looking point of what could
have passed for a milky white glass. A very close look showed minute
serrations on this point and Muresh demonstrated its strength by sawing
through a chlen-hide vambrace. The fletching was difficult to identify it 
looked like it was a piece from an insect wing but seemed too be too tough
for this source.)

The Kurtani make some arrow heads out of bone including the blunts they 
use for fowling. A Kurtani's preferred target when hunting animals is the
muzzle or eye as this avoids damage to the creature's skin increasing the 
worth. Also a man who has to shoot the body of the animal to bring it down
is accounted a poor archer. This is why Kurtani seem so amused when some
lordling recounts his hunting prowess as very few Tsolyani archers would
take a risk of missing the charging Zrne by shooting it through the eye but
a Kurtani would."

"Around Fasiltum they play an archery game using basket targets of woven
leather. These are arranged in a pile and archers fire at about 60-dhaiba 
distance. The archer who scatters the baskets first is regarded warmly by 
the locals."

"The different legions of Tsolyanu paint their arrows in distinctive
colours and patterns, as examples: my old legion (Girikteshmu, 23rd
Imperial Archers) paint theirs in a spiral pattern of red and blue, the
Legion of the Clan of the Broken Bough uses stripes of red and orange and 
the Legion of the Peaks of Kraa paint theirs bone white. I believe that
some of the Yan Koryani do the same but I do not know their legion
patterns. The Mu'uglavyani use red and black on their arrows in different 
patterns ie stripes, spirals, the front and back being different even
checker patterns but again I do not know the significance if any."

>Well done. Nice piece. I have to give old Muresh credit for his knowledge.

[                   their worship Hrsh, and their plans for Livyanu.          ]

>One more question regarding the Temple of Hrsh: is it now or can it be

Missionaries are rather uncommon on Tekumel, where a variety of deities,
sects, and beliefs are not only tolerated but rather expected. The pressure
brought to bear upon non-believers is more economic and social than
outright religious. Join the right religion and be a member of the club!
Lower taxes, business concessions and commissions, less bureaucratic
hassle, the right to join various elite organisations in the army and
administration, etc. The Mu'ugalavyani indeed lack subtlety, but they
realise that stomping their way through Livyanu will get them precious few
converts. Their officers have been warned to keep the troops in check,
although there has been looting and many impromptu executions of
"resistors." The pressure is all through making it possible for cooperative
Livyani to maintain their lives, properties, etc. with some dignity, while
those who do not collaborate are ignored, subtly mistreated, and left
outside the circles of government/priesthood/business.

The Mu'ugalavyani have a rather proprietary attitude towards Lord Hrsh:
they prefer keeping him for themselves. All his rituals are in Classical
Mu'ugalavyani, with only smatterings in Engsvanyali. Converts are accepted
but not really made very welcome. His inner circles are closed to those who
are not descended from impeccable Mu'ugalavyani ethnic lines.

[Moderator's Note:  Paul Snow asks about Heroes of the Age, and puts forth ]
[                   an associate's hypothesis about how they are chosen.   ]
[                   What are your thoughts on this hypothesis, Professor?  ]

Greetings,

	Nikun hiSayodla here.  I've managed to snatch a rest in my
teaching duties here in the Temple Academy and I thought I would
communicate with my colleagues in the Blue Room on some current research
interests. 

	I recently read with interest the history of The Ever-Glorious
Empire: Engsvan hla Ganga by Bareka hiShanyal of the Clan of the High
Pinnacle.  While, of course, the knowledge contained within that document
has been common knowledge for Scholar Priests of our Ancient Lord of
Secrets for many years, I was pleased to see its open publication. 

	However, while I truly enjoyed the scholarly discourse of
Librarian Bareka I felt he failed to make a few points clear.  It was the
divine will of our Lord Ksarul, manifest in his aspect Lord Enome, that
granted Pavar his visions and thus brought about the Engsvan hla Ganga.
When Our Lord Ksarul choses to share knowledge, its revelation brings
change, power and greatness to Tekumel.  But enough of Temple dogma ... 

	On p23 of the cited work, when discussing the Heroes of The Age,
it is said that five (sometimes six) persons make up a composite "Hero"
whose duty it is to defend the Plane against the Pariah Deities.  Now, I
know that each of us have five souls the Baletl (the Spirit Soul), the
Bakte (the Body), the Chusetl (the Shadow self), the Hlakme (the conscious
mind)  and the Pedhetl (the Enemy).

	I postulate that _the_ Hero that defends the Plane is composed of
five souls donated by the five Heroes who donate the greatest available
Baletl, Bakte, Chusetl, Hlakme and Pedhetl.

We can test this theory by looking at the example given.  I will attribute
to each Hero the soul that he donated.

At the end of the Second Epoch the task fell to:-

Kaijuma Vurudhame, a soldier, archer and nobleman of Purdanim [Baletl]

the Wise Maiden Melende [Hlakme]

the Trickster Erjuon of Tha'mis [Pedhetl]

the Dealer in Magics Khorkhonu of Te'ero [Chusetl]

"Thick" Choggu - "He Who Crushes Sro" [Bakte]


I would be delighted to hear any comments that anyone has on this.


Best wishes,
Nikun hi Sayodla of the Blue Hood Clan.

[Moderator's Note:  Paul Snow asks about the Kaija Protectorate.             ]

>Nikun hiSayodla here with some questions.

>First, here is the background to my questions.

>I've been reading more history and found that Emperor Gyesmu "the Iron
>Fist" (2015-2065) added the Three Protectorates to Tsolyanu.  These
>protectorates are (were) Kaija, Kerunan and Chaigari.

>Looking at the maps which I have available, I found that the Kaija
>Protectorate is a large area of land that stretches (as far as I can tell)
>from Jaikalor and the Hlutgru invested swamps in the East over to Jakalla
>and the Mssuma River in the West.

>This astounds me as it means that Jakalla which I think of as a typical
>and defining Tsolyani city was for many years not part of the Empire.  Or
>possibly, if the border of the Kaija Protectorate is the Equnoyel River
>then Jakalla straddled the border between Tsolyanu and the Salarvyani
>controlled Kaija.

The Kaija Protectorate was indeed founded during the Time of the Usurpers.
It was simply left out when the final treaties were signed and sealed.
There were political reasons for this, which are too complex to go into
here. The area had always been "difficult" The eastern part was always a
favourite hunting ground for the Hlutrgu. The west was a backwater of
agricultural holdings that fed (and still feed) Jakalla and her sister port
cities. There were local governors who were either toadies of the Petal
Throne or else local separatists. Often these people seem to have been
personally greedy, without much ideology of any kind.

Kaija then remained semi-independent during part of the Second Imperium.
The Salarvyani claimed it, but the Tsolyani occupied it without any legal
basis for doing so. There was little danger that it ever would have fallen
completely under Salarvyani domination, not even when the Tsolyani Imperium
was at its weakest and most fragmented. Kaija is simply too important to
Jakalla to allow that to happen, and the Salarvyani have too much to do
elsewhere -- and supply lines that would be much too long for any important
war effort.

>It is not clear to me when these Protectorates were founded. I guess that
>they might date from The Time of the Usurpers (1699) when Vriggetsu Dnash
>"the Usurper of the South" presumable held power in this region but I can
>find no definite details on the Protectorates.

There are indeed a few histories and treatises on them, but these are in
Tsolyani. Kerunan and Chaigari were indeed fairly close to Salarvya and
under the domination of Khum and Koyluga respectively. The Tsolyani seized
these by force of arms -- he was trying to retake Mmillaka, after several
centuries of changing fortunes, but in this he finally was unsuccessful.

>So my questions are:-
>
>1. The establishment of the Protectorates.  When? How? Do these political
>boundaries just date back to the Priestkings?

The boundaries date from local traditions during the Second Imperium,
although the names and terrirotial identifications do appear to have been
used by the Engsvanyali.

>2. Does Kaija include Jakalla?

No. Kaija usually refers to the south bank of the Equnoyel river, over to
Jaikalor (which the Tsolyani always said was "their" city, and on down
south into the Swamps where the Hlutrgu hold sway. At times, however, when
it suited their political needs, the inhabitants of the region between the
Rananga River and the Equnoyel also spoke of themselves as "Kaijani." Even
the people of Thraya briefly declared themselves an "historical and
traditional part of Kaija" for a few years during bad times.

>3. When were the Three Protectorates lost such that Emperor Gyesmu had to
>retake them?

The tradition goes back into Engsvanyali times: these places (not then
carefully delineated by any boundaries) had all been part of the Empire of
Ganga. The Tsolyani now state that they are only trying to reconstitute the
Priestkings' Empire. But then, the Salarvyani can say this, too. They are
descendants of the Engsvanyali, after all! The whole issue is clouded by
perceived nationalisms and propaganda.

>4. How did the Gangan Archipelago fare when an independent protectorate
>was controllling one bank of the Mssuma river? Did this effect trade?

In the days of the Priestkings, the western  portions of Kaija were always
under control of Ganga, while the southeast was left to the Hlutrgu. The
little monsters were just too numerous and too tough to eradicate. A kind
of "assumed" treaty of non-aggression seems to have existed with this alien
species in those days, as it more or less does today. Neither party wants
to risk many casualties and a long and ugly campaign. The Hlutrgu used to
make their yearly migrations out into Msumtel Bay, floating ashore on Ganga
and Thayuri Isles in their little coracles. Now they no longer do this,
preferring instead to trek south through the swamps and launch their little
boats into the northwestern areas of Tamkade Bay, from whence they let the
currents carry them on south out to sea and eventual death. Why they follow
this practice is unknown -- perhaps instinctive behaviour from their own
original world?  Like the lemmings of old Terra?

The land of Kaija was somewhat higher in those days, before the sinking of
Ganga. The Priestkings' historians treat the Kaija region as a backwater
used for agriculture, with some pretty villas built in the western part for
country residences. This continues to this day, as everyone knows, with
Prince Rereshqala's fancy mansion in hex (Zocchi map) 2615.

The human inhabitants of northern and western Kaija have always been
docile, Tsolyani-speaking, suburbanites, with few pretenses to autonomy
(barring a few unwise proclamations by later governors who were only
beating their drums to establish their own importance and make money!).
These officials were no more and no less venal than the administrations of
other provinces of the empire. In Kerunan and Chaigari, however, the
population was mixed with Salarvyani elements, and the governments (such as
they were!) had to be restructured when Gyesmu's troops took over. Now
these people, too, are culturally Tsolyani for all intents and purposes.

Phil

I'll see what I can say about the heroes of the Age. Much of their lore is
simply legend, or is contained in sectarian histories that  probably
contain a good portion of propaganda.

Only the Ndalu Clan preaches that Pavar received his Pantheon and
revelations through Lord Ksarul (Enome in those days). Most of the other
sects either ignore  questions of this kind, or else go along with the
usual dogma that it was "the Gods" who revealed these matters to Pavar,
using Thumis as their "pipeline." A few texts do proclaim Hnalla as the
intermediary to Pavar. Needless to say, there are no contemporary texts or
"authentic" sources (that are beyond a good chance of having been doctored).

>	On p23 of the cited work, when discussing the Heroes of The Age,

Again, straight from the doctrines of the Ndalu Clan! Whether this is fact
or theory is up to the believer.

Your postulations do indeed make good sense. Really,though, you should read
some of the Stability treatises on this subject.

I would think that our esteemed colleague, Nikun hi Sayodla of the Blue Hood

the number of the Doomed Prince of the Blue Room.  (Five is that of Lord
Sarku.)  ;-)

(Then again, maybe Professor Barker's excellent "Tsolyani Numerology" article
 isn't in wide circulation.  We have a Ksarul numerologist in our campaign.)

[Moderator's Note:  Gordon Neff wonders if there are any Bram Stoker style ]
[                   vampires on Tekumel and the effect their longevity     ]
[                   would have on their perspective of events on Tekumel.  ]

There may be extant works that would tell me the answers to this query, but 
I haven't seen any such, and what -does- exist may not give real answer
anyway.

Some time back, I mentioned the peculiar advantage that a vampire might
enjoy on Tekumel, living in cultures of such hoary antiquity that 'future 
shock' is an utterly unknown and inconceivable problem, where only extreme 
longevity, in whatever form that may take, can provide any sense of dynamic 
change at all.

Given this, my question is obvious: ARE there vampires, by the modern Bram 
Stoker/Anne Rice definition of the term, on Tekumel? I give that qualifi-
cation for obvious reasons; I'm well aware of things such as the Mrur, and 
even the Shedra, but these appear more akin to liches--there's not much 
chance of either one -passing- in human society, what I mean...

I can see how there -might- be, if the spells by which the Mrur were 
created were 'fine-tuned' a bit, but if such a refinement existed the 
priesthood of Sarku would be using it already.

So, could one find 'Hehellukoi Vlad hiDraku' somewhere on Tekumel...?

Houston, we have a problem...

>Tekumel has 2 moons, Kashi (smaller as seen from Tekumel, and red) and 
>Gayel (light green). If Kashi has an orbit of 30 days, and Gayel of 15,

*are both frequent together in the night sky. Anybody who wants to play with
*astronomy is welcome to give it a try.
*
*Regards,
*
*Phil

So, I did-- or started to.

It was that business of "If Kashi has an orbit of 30 days, and Gayel of
15," that got me thinking.

"If the orbital periods are not perfectly 15 days and 30 days, of course
the corresponding phases of the moons will drift slightly from year to 
year," John Grandidge says. It's not likely that they -would- be, as Phil 
points out--but what are they, then?

My source for astronomical data was, of course, Volume I of 'Swords and
Glory,' where facts and figures are laid out nicely... -too- nicely.

For one thing, we are told that Tekumel has a diameter of 20,838 km.
Earth itself has a diameter of 12,746 km. Far from being 'slightly 
larger,' Tekumel is 1.6 times the size of Earth. (If we make the gentle 
assumption that 'diameter' and 'radius' became confused, as I first 
considered, that would make it -smaller-.)

There is only one Solar example that comes close: As Mars is to Earth, 
so Earth would be to Tekumel. It is on the threshold of being a 
'subjovian' gas giant!

Further, Kashi's orbit, at a mean distance of 568,350 km, has an orbital
period (assuming Terrestrial gravity, which is so implied by the 
'adjustments' mentioned) of 50 days, 18 hours, give or take a few 
minutes. (Gayel completes its own orbital revolution in 25 days, 16 hrs, 
and some odd minutes.)

You can see that your Sourcebook is going to need some... editing.
(Curiously, Gayel's orbital period is still 0.51 that of Kashi; 
wherever Phil got his figures, they obviously -felt- right...)

*		*		*

But if you fudge the numbers so they come out right, Mr Grandidge's
questions are easily answered. Yes, of course Kashi and Gayel are full 
together; if one satellite has twice the orbital period of the other, 
Gayel will also be full when Kashi is on the other side of the sky, and 
they will both be 'new' together as well.

What's more, every sixty days Gayel will indeed transit Kashi (not
eclipse; it's not large enough) as seen from -somewhere- on the Equator, 
as it enters opposition while both moons are crossing the equatorial 
plane. Of course, the necessary viewpoint will often be in the middle 
of the ocean...

If you want corrected figures for your Sourcebook-- and I mean, 'if'; if
anyone in twenty-two years has ever called this question, I'll be 
astounded--I'll cook 'em up for you.

If you want Tekumel to have anything like a breathable atmosphere, and
not a reducing witches-brew of helium and methane, boiling under the solar 
glare by day and lit by eerie, crackling aurorae at night ('lighter core 
elements' indeed; if Earth had no magnetic field, the 'Northern Lights' 
would dance over the whole planet with the deadly brilliance of unshielded 
radiation, and where d'ye suppose that field -comes- from? And Tekumel is 
even -closer- to its Sun...) then you'll want some tinkering with that 
diameter as well.

Yr most humble and obedient,
G J N

P.S. Sure, it would be on its -way- to a Terrestrial oxy-nitrogen mix; 
that's what a 'reducing' atmosphere is. It would no longer look like a 
half-pint Jupiter, especially after the gravitation was adjusted; it 
would look more like a feverishly sick Venus, with a surface temperature 
that would boil LEAD.


[Moderator's Note:  Gordon further wrote the following.                     ]

"What's more, every sixty days Gayel will indeed transit Kashi (not
eclipse; it's not large enough) as seen from -somewhere- on the Equator, 
as it enters opposition..."

My fault-- I confused the sizes of the two moons as seen from the
surface. Of course it will eclipse it utterly. Given time and incentive, 
I could work out how long each eclipse would last, if you were interested.

> >Nikun hi Sayodla of the Blue Hood Clan.

> And do give my regards to your Ndalu Clan masters...!

Whoops! I see that my comments gave away some of my new relgious insight. 

If you remember, a while ago I had a few interesting conversations with my
dear uncle Arksa hiVayka [Blue Room message 24].  After that some of his
friends came to see me and made me see some theological matters in a new
light.  If I have let a few things slip then I hope that the retribution
will not be too great.  If I am lucky perhaps only a new post teaching
grubby infants in the Swamps of Ksarul until I have learned the art of
silence. 

Meanwhile, what can you tell me of my masters in the Ndalu Clan?

I find it interesting that there is only one other secret society to
compare itself with that great building block of our life, the clan.  Was
Ndalu a person or is this clan a lost lineage of one of the ancient Ksarul
worshipping clans?

I even have some very wild speculations which I would like to share with
you.  I have heard it whispered that in the early days of the Empire that
the Tlakotoni struggled with the Priesthood of Ksarul for dominance of the
land that is now Tsolyanu.  I believe that the Ndalu Clan was formed out
of the Ksarul worshipping faction that lost that struggle.  They are after
all still dedicated to the pursuit of political power; trying to grasp
that which slipped through their hands before.

There *are* such things as Jajgi, and they are capable of "passing."  They
don't drink blood (as far as I know), but they are undead... and as long as
they remember to breathe when around the warm, they can be very hard to spot.

Ask my players.

If you mean undead creatures who suck blood to survive, fizzle and smoke in
the sunlight, turn into bats and fly around the room, get all upset when
faced with garlic, and go bonkers when confronted by a cross (and what
*does* a Jewish vampire do-- or a Ksarul, etc. vampire?)--- the answer is
no.

Tekumel's undead do include the Jajgi, however, which is a similar sort of
entity. The Jajgi is a much more intelligent Shedra. It can have a
normal-appearing body, clever mind, and many talents. But it's dead and has
to be activated by Other Planar power. (Sounds like some people I know...
eh?)

Exactly. The Jajgi takes a lot of fine-tuning, and it is not common. It
cannot "convert" living victims by biting them, of course, nor does it have
anything to do with religion. It is simply a corpse that has been
"repowered" by energy from the Planes Beyond, with certain features (a
normal-appearing body, for example) and talents (often psychic, sometimes
armed with sorcerous spells) and with a free will of its own. It is not a
"slave" of some higher master -- unless given a mindbar and "dominated" by
that mage. It's a pretty scary item because it is so normal. It can even
breathe to fool others, though bleeding is pretty difficult for it to
simulate.

>So, could one find 'Hehellukoi Vlad hiDraku' somewhere on Tekumel...?

Not as such. But a nice Jajgi? Absolutely.

[Moderator's Note:  Alan Musielewicz writes about an adventure in the Prof's ]
[                   campaign where they were involved with a Hero of the Age.]
[                   Find those notes, Al!  I'm very interested in hearing of ]
[                   the adventure.                                           ]

I believe there were five of us when we formed the hero of the age. It took
several years (of real time) to get the materials, items, devices, demon
allies, interplaner connections,  and the like together in order to form the
hero of the age.  The battle was incredible and I will have to look for my
notes. Of the five, two of us after defeating the Pariah deities decided to
cross to the other side.  Illoa Tlashte out of a sense of wonder,
revelation, duty to his father and after becoming privy to some of the
deeper secrets of Tekumel (which we are sworn never to reveal) and I Achan
Tlashte (formerly hi' Sayanu of the Red Mountain Clan in Jakalla) did so out
of loyalty to my Lord Illoa, thus making my one ultimate act of loyalty to 
my lord also my ultimate act of betrayal to my people.
