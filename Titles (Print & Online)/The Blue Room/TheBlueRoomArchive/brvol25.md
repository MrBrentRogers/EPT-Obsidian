These messages are the accumulation of the messages that were sent out on 
the Blue Room email list between May 1995 and June 2000.  A large portion 
of the information is directly from Professor M.A.R Barker. When the list 
members joined during the time the list was active, they agreed to refrain 
from sharing this data with non list members.  When the list ended, it was 
urged that the data be made available to non-list Tekumel fans, and it 
seemed like a good idea all around.

I only ask that if you download these digests, or have received them in 
some other way, please respect the agreements the list members made, and 
refrain from passing them around and instead point people to the Tekumel 
web site, www.tekumel.com so that they can download them for themselves, 
and see all the other material available on the Tekumel.com web site.

Many Thanks.

Sounds more to me like he was 'ragging the greenhorn,' telling tall
tales to the credulous tourist. The giveaway is the supposed presence of
bookbindings and paper, however 'ruined,' after thousands of years in the
ocean (!!). Perhaps he also found a banquet hall, with food still on the
plates? Do tell.

[Moderator's Note:  Charles Blakely asks about the Mad God of Hlikku.      ]

I would like to know more about the Mad God of Hlikku.  What exactly are the
ceremonies of the worshippers and what IS the god?  Why is it limited to the
city of Hlikku itself?  Does the God communicate directly with all of the
inhabitants of the city?  In an adventure run by Curtis Scott we tried to
infiltrate the city dressed as the natives, but were instantly recognized, so
we suspected a kind of telepathy emanating from "brain" of the god or focus or
temple located in the confines of the city.  I would like to know more about
the culture of the inhabitants themselves.

Sincerely,

Charles F. Blakely

[Moderator's Note:  Peter Bismire supplied a Province/Capital list with a few]
[                   missing capital cities.  Professor Barker has supplied   ]
[                   the missing details.  Thanks Peter, and thanks Phil.     ]

Most of the provinces that have no capitals (cities or large towns) are run
from headquarters in smaller towns that do not appear on the maps. Remember
that the Empire has a network (a maze, according to many) of secondary
roads that frequently have villages and sizeable towns at their crossroads.
Most of these little places are unimportant; some are actually "ruled" from
next-door in a larger and more prosperous city.

You want all of these little places? I'll add them to your list below. Also
fix a couple of spelling errors (e.g. "Khirgari" for "Khirgar").

                        Urudai next door.

[Moderator's Note:  Dwight Grosso asks about Tsolyani poetry.                ]

>like. I know from the reference works that it is rather complicated and grand
>in its composition, but what kind of poetry from Earth would it be like? I
>imagine them to be more like Hindu works for some reason

You are pretty close. THe Vedas or the Ramayana are quite similar, although
the Tsolyani metres and rhyme schemes tend to be more complicated. I can't
go into this in more depth because I know too little about Western poetry
myself. I did a "reader of classical Urdu poetry" once which ran to three
thick volumes and had a lengthy dissertation on Arabic-Persian-Urdu metre
and rhyme in it. Now there is a real toughie! The Tsolyani have love odes
(Engsvanyali has the best: e.g. Yetil of Ganga), religious poetry (rather
like Akhnaton's "Hymn to the Aten"), and lots of narrative epic poetry
(like Homer, the Hindu epics, the Kalevala, etc.).

>While we are on this
>subject, what do the other nations consider to be great literature and poetry?
>I have a hard time imagining the Mu'ugalavyani enjoying Tsolyani poetry.

The Mu'ugalavyani like Yetil's delicately phrased romantic poetry, but they
have their own more martial epics and hymns to the Lord Hrsh. There are
also a few popular singer-poets (bards), who specialise in military
exploits and descriptions of heroism.

>I can
>easily see a Nluss babrbarian enjoying a bawdy Irish ballad.

He might. He would certainly be puzzled at some of the content, however.

>I'd like to know
>more about the structure of the poetry, because  it's a nice way to introduce
>some adventures, and what higher honor is there than to have an epic composed
>in your honor after all? Thanks for the help.

I can't help you with detailed rules for scansion and rhyme. Wish I knew
more about this subject! There are various competing systems: Engsvanyali
rhyme schemes are seen as the simplest and most beautiful. The
Mu'ugalavyani have a system of word-stress and rhythmic "beats" that make
their poetry sound like marching feet, even when it is intended to convey
the tenderest sentiments. The Salarvyani have poetry that plays upon the
complexities of their language. The Tsolyani use word-stress (plus closed
syllables) as the basis for their metrics, and their rhyme scheme is
usually intelligible to a modern American-European.

The Ahoggya use bodily sounds as part of their poetry: vocal plus slapping
of hands, snorting, loud reports from various orifices, whistling and
wheezing from other orifices, etc. etc. No one has ever successfully
described (much less imitated) an Ahoggya sonnet!

There is a fundamental difference between Tsolyani religion and real world 
religion (or maybe not...), namely that the pantheons were dictated to the 
priest Pavar.  Before him, there were only the gods of Change, and I do 
not believe that they were clumped together in a common faction.  The 
appearance of Hnalla and others caused the division.  So I doubt that the 
division arrose from a cultural condition.  However, that does not mean to 
say that it has not developped since Pavar "discovered" the gods of Stability.

>Do Tsolyani look for a Stability/Change balance or imbalance in their

>From reading the timelines, it appears to me that Engsvan hla Ganga was 
originally a Stability worshipping nation and that the gods of Change were 
pushed asside forcefully, until it was determined that that was not going 
to occur and the Concordant (in one form or another was formed).  I can see 
a superstition arising from this where the followers of Change could blame 
all of their misfortune on the forces of Stability and visa versa.  I kind 
of see the division as a "devil made me do it" type of a philosophy rather 
than any practical, or quanitative division.

I'd say this was the case if the herdsman was a follower of Stability, but 
probably not from a follower of Change (unless he used the Dark Trinity of 
Hru'u, Sarku, and Ksarul as boogymen).

[Moderator's Note:  George Hammond asks about the climate of Tekumel.      ]

Hi all,

As a first step in thinking about the "natural history" of Tekumel, I've
been considering the climate.  The Swords & Glory Sourcebook gives some
useful information on temperatures, but it would be helpful to know a
little more about seasons. I don't need to know specific dates or rainfall
amounts (though of course that would be welcome). I'm just asking when do
the rains come, and for how long?  

For instance, the Sourcebook mentions a monsoon in Southern Tsolyanu and
coastal Salarvya.  What time of year does it occur?  The first of the
Adventures on Tekumel books has a calendar with some seasonal information
(rains start, harvest month, etc.) but it's not clear what region the
calendar applies to, especially since some crops (e.g.  Dna-grain) are
harvested 2 or 3 times a year.  Any information from your Tekumel
correspondents would be much appreciated.

(Professor Barker, I understand your reluctance to get involved with
technical details beyond your expertise.  I have the same reaction to many
of the linguistic issues <g>.  I'm happy to work from observations and
impressions, and try to elaborate/explain from there.) 

In exchange, I offer these brief thoughts on the heat of the moment:

One of the factors that got me thinking about climate is the heat,
especially in the south.  Temperatures in Jakalla and Tsamra regularly
range into the 100's/40's (F/C), with extremes higher than any measured on
Earth.  This kind of heat can easily be lethal to humans, even to those
who are fully acclimated from birth. Humans can keep a normal body
temperature at up to 130/54.4 if the air is dry and they have adequate
water (see below), but if the humidity is high, sweating is much less
effective (body temp can rise to deadly levels in 94/34.4 degree air if
humidity is 100%).  Of course all of this assumes no heavy physical labor. 
Doing real work lowers the lethal temperatures even more. 

This suggests to me that many Tekumelyani, not just the Livyani, become
practically nocturnal during the hot months, or at least take *very* long
siestas.  It would be simply impossible to work the Jaffa-rice paddies
outside Jakalla on summer days, and the military campaigning season in the
southern regions would probably be centered on winter months. Sea travel
in the hot months could be hazardous, and ships would all have sun shades
rigged over as much of their decks as possible.  If military actions were
taken in the summer, units of heat-tolerant Shen could be of tremendous
value on land or sea.

Of course to live at all in such heat, one needs lots of water.  Just
sitting in the shade at 104/40, an adult human loses c. .25 kg of water
per hour.  Marching in the sun at the same temp increases that to 1 kg per
hour.  Dehydration is lethal at about 12% of body weight, so at that rate
70 kg person could die of thirst in one long day.  As a rule of thumb,
even assuming most activity is in the cool of the night and early morning,
troops in the desert or slaves on a desert sakbe road might easily need
2-3 kg water per day.  Vigorous activity in day would quickly double or
triple that.  Anybody travelling in the summer would have to carry lots of
water, and without enormous quantities of bearers, an army might not be
able to move much faster than its Chlen-carts of precious water.  Worse
yet, loss of said carts could be a death sentence for otherwise intact
legions.  Ignoble action to be sure, but such lofty sentiments mean
nothing to the Milumanayani nomads (or the hated Ssu, or the Pygmy Folk,
or...)

Some other interesting implications to think about:

--Ownership of the water concession (or the Imperial revenues from water
tax) on a sakbe road through drylands could be truly lucrative... 

--Salt is probably a commodity of considerable strategic value, especially
given how inhospitable and humid most of the Tsolyani coast is.  If the 
Tsolyani extract salt from the ocean, then the works are liable to be a
hell-hole among hell-holes.  Salt mines (if they exist) would be very
valuable.

--Depending on how the rains and seasons intertwine, large-scale
migrations of animals could occur. Herds of wild Chlen or Tsi'il making
their inexorable way to water would be an awesome, and awesomely
destructive, phenomenon.  How regrettable if one's clan had started a new
plantation in their path...

--To be blown south by an ocean storm is to face grave peril, even if you
don't get all the way to the 60C degree band at the equator.

--Only widely-traveled Tsolyani who have had the misfortune to be in the
north or among high mountains in winter will have ever seen frost, much
less ice or snow.  

--"Warm-blooded" animals spend the vast majority of their energy
maintaining their body temperature. "Cold-blooded" creatures don't have
that metabolic cost, so you get much more new crocodile per kg of croc
food than you get new wolf per kg of wolf food.  In the warm climes of
Tekumel, densities of insects and other "cold-blooded" creatures will be
high (compared to what most of us temperate-zone types are used to).  They
might displace "warm-blooded" types that occupy similar niches further
north.  These "cold-blooded" types might be especially vulnerable to
cold-based magic. 

--Particularly in the south, cities are likely to have a tremendous amount
of shade built-in.  Porticos, awnings, arbors, extended eaves, colonnades,
and pavilions are likely to be major parts of the architecture. I would
bet many cities are similar to Sokatis, where you can walk the length of
the city without stepping into the sun.  Are parasols used in the 5
Empires? 

--Of course, humans alive in the distant future might not have
the same temperature sensitivities that we do.  Perhaps their ancestors
all had heat tolerant proteins and super-efficent sweating systems
engineered into their genes.  But where's the sport in that? <g>

Telekinesis spells are too short-range to make good artillery propellants.
They also tend to be too weak. It is more economical to use magic if the
structure has not been "proofed." If it has, the usual role for mages is
against personnel.

This sounds too "modern-scientific." I doubt whether any Tekumelani would
think of it. The use of fire-demons is limited, rare, and risky, and
submerging one in a cauldron (how did he get in -- and let you seal the
caulgron in the first place?) is a sure way of suicide.

>You'd certainly have the makings of a great steam cannon, too--
>after a few disastrous experiments.

Too disastrous. There would also have to be a *theory* about the efficacy
of a steam cannon in the first place. The Tekumelani don't have steam
engines and would be quite amazed at all this. Remember, there is little
interest in "hard science" on magic-rich and metal-poor Tekumel.

All true, as I see it.

Some folk do not think far enough ahead to be able to perceive the
consequences of an "instant martyr." Try explaining this to some plump
bureaucrat in the Palace of the Realm in Jakalla -- or to the Sanjedrin and
Pontius Pilate...

In the 20th Century on this planet we have achieved a certain tolerance for
other faiths and "new religions" (as if anything really can be new!). In
earlier times you would get a swift trip to the Inquisition or to a witch's
gallows. The Tekumelani worship many deities, some with very different
(almost opposing at times) theologies, goals, and precepts; there is room
for differences of all kinds, *unless* the perpetrator rocks the social
boat and upsets the folks in power. There are plenty of "crazies" but very
few *successful* crazies.

Good thing, too. People can get killed or injured in the resulting chaos
from a successful "crazy attack."

>But if they'd had a SPELL to do the same thing, from a distance, now...

Not as easy as it looks. Get in close enough for a spell to function, hit
the leader or speaker with it, make it effective -- and get out. Ritual
spells require movements, vocables, and gestures that make the caster very
visible to others, and there is also a sort of aura around major
spellcasting that makes other nearby mages aware that a spell is being cast.

Given Tekumelani society, Hitler would have had his own spellcasters and
would swiftly have dissipated the spell -- and erected a few of his own. He
could have set up a repeating message for Winston Churchill saying, "Cigars
are dangerous to your health..."

Neither the government for the temples can make a person Nakome without
concurrence of that erson's clan. He *has* to be expelled first. There are
plenty of Nakomeyal anyway: lowest of the low people who perhaps never had
a clan, or whose parents lost theirs (it's usually hereditary). Criminals,
debtors, and ne'er-do-wells may also be Nakome, Making your religious
leader Nakome might work, but it would be far easier to ignore him, at
least until he showed signs of becoming too powerful -- then a quick
mindbar ot a trip to an ecclesiastical dungeon would fix him!

It's not an absolutely sure thing, of course, An occasional religious
change does become important -- as Pavar's pantheon itself testifies. THe
status quo is a ponderous weight, however.

stamens, much less of growing seasons, soils, etc. Here on Terra, I watch
my wife growing things in her back yard; her activities are as mysterious
to me as a Hru'u ceremony held in a dark room at midnight!

There are a few four-legged critters from other worlds, just as we have
four-, six- and eight-legged thingies.

You just described the Kayi quite well. It is mostly nocturnal and inhabits
tombs and caves, however. Never grows much bigger than 4-5 feet in
diametre, but its tentacles are dangerous. See the Bestiary.

Now you're spoiling the guide's pitch! He pays good bribes to the local
administrators to provide occasional "proofs" of his tourist legends. A
soggy bookbinding with the Priestkings' sigil upon it is worth a lot to
these fellows. There are dozens of little boys industriously manufacturing
stone, clay, and metal statues and religious icons "dug up from the ocean
floor where once Great Pavar walked." Some local entrepreneur once put
together a bundle of plastic tubes and bottles and called it a "magic
breather" for use in exploring underwater Ganga. Three people died before
they gave up on trying to make it work -- some player characters are just
as gullible as a many Tsolyani tourists...

The city is sealed to outsiders, rather like Dlash in Livyanu but with an
added feature of raw violence directed towards interlopers. No one knows
who the Mad God is, but there are theories that he is a manifestation of
one of the three Pariah Deities, possibly She Who Cannot Be Named herself
since the other two are not as hostile and virulent. The God is *said* to
communicate with those worshippers who are most dedicated (= fanatic),
although this has not been proved. The Yan Koryani use regular contingents
sent out from the city in their military forces because they are such
berserkers. They don't accept guidance and orders very well, however, and a
commander has to be skillful to get them to do what is wanted.

I don't know much more than this. I'm rather glad that none of my parties
have ever chosen to venture into Hlikku. I don't recall ever having had a
party visit the "outsider" markets and "foreigners' suburb outside its
walls either. Leather, bone implements, various kinds of semi-precious
stones, etc. are traded out of the city by intermediary merchants who live
there most of the year -- but who leave and go elsewhere for 30 days or
more when the people of Hlikku hold their great annual celebration for
their strange deity. Then it gets ugly.

[Moderator's Note:  David Aitken asks for Web-based Tekumel players.  Get in ]
[                   touch with him via the address and URL below.            ]

Gentlemen & Ladies,

I have been running a Web-based Tekumel campaign for almost a year now,
and am looking to expand my user base.  Time commitment is variable, but
to be the most interesting, expect to spend perhaps ten minutes every
day or two.

I am loosely following the Swords & Glory rules, but since I have entered
most of these to the web-site, it is not necessary for you to have a copy
of this (admittedly hard to find) volume to play effectively.  I do not
focus on "rules" anyways, using them mostly for character generation and
the occasional detailed melee session; the emphasis is on role-playing
and on story-telling.  In the future I may further simplify the rules and
character generation systems, to make it easier and faster to get a new
player up to speed.

The system is predominently based on the interaction of player(s) and
the referee through an append-only "Journal" mechanism.  After generating
a character through a series of web-forms, the referee will set the
stage for your character by creating an initial journal entry.  We then
take turns (separated by minutes or days), appending to this living "novel".
After every turn an eMail notification is generated to inform the other
party.

I work hard to incorporate as much Tekumelani detail and flavor as I can,
and encourage my players to do the same.  Within the journal reply system
it is easy to include a non-narrative comment or question; this allows for
cooperation between player and referee in clearly and effectively describing
situations, and still allows for these sections to be easily hidden from
the journal for future reading.

Amongst the small group of players I currently have, we have composed in
excess of 150 pages of high quality novels; not unlike the wonderful
efforts of Professor Barker in his "Man of Gold" and "Flamesong".  Since
everything is kept in a database, these can be reviewed at any time over
the web - or printed out for your reading pleasure.  I have posted some
samples on the web with the permission of my players; they make a great
read.

If you are interested in joining an active and mature campaign set on the
wonderfull world of Tekumel, please come on over and take a look, then
send me an eMail to get a login and password for full access.

[Moderator's Note:  Steve Pisani writes on the topic of new religions.  He ]
[                   titles it, Fragile Religions but Persitant Ideas.      ]

This post concerns the dialogue about new religions unacceptable to the 
status quo on Tekumel.

It seems that the ages of man on Tekumel include millennia of relative
consistency in their oligarchs and beliefs.  It also appears that these  
ages can collapse into chaos via religious misadventure.  Apparently, 
some theological threats don't show themselves at once.

The magic of Llyan's time reached beyond the planes - and to that which we 
call Vimuhla. ["The number you have reached...demands sacrifice."]   The 
Dragon Warriors incinerated all before them by following Vimuhla - and then 
immolated themselves.  [Anyone seen the directions for the cluster bombs ?]  
Nayari and company founded a huge, centralized police-state which could 
counter anything.  This apparently did not include Pavar, channeling the 
new Vedic Vehicle Code for the pocket-dimension like Shirley Mclaine.

Don't worry, the corrupt, thought-stagnant and disunited empires of this 
age have everything under control.  All is well.  If the Romans could keep 
those silly Christians underground, publicly humiliated or serving as lion 
chow, then the Five Empires can keep a lid on anything.

Ack!!  Hi Chris

I was both amused and somewhat concerned at the previous posts concerning
these beings.  Though I would very much like to think that they are
"official," they are only fabrications on my part (for the most part).
After the first edition of the timeline went out and it was decided that it
wouldn't be recognized as "official," I just added these three to the second
edition of the chronology (everything else is consistent with canonized
documents).

I worked on the assumption that there are probably other alien civilizations
out there (I thought were was something mentioned to that fact in Sourcebook
Vol. 1, but I could not find anything either).  Thus were these three highly
exotic species formed from the comsic dust.

In my little slice of the Tekumel Multiverse, a few pieces of information
originating from the Golden Age of Tekumel (pre-Cataclysm) have been
recovered.  Most of the hints have come from pictoral material and other
artifacts bearing likenesses of the first two species (though no modern
scholar would probably classify them as being intelligent), and the third is
the closest thing that a Tsolyani scholar could translate from metal plates
with Llyani inscriptions (as well as a few hints that this third species
somehow became involved with the Goddess of the Pale Bone...)  No picture
was available for this alien race.

I apologize if this has caused any consternation for the Professor or any
other fellow readers.  Course, if anyone would like a little more
information on these alien races (since they still thrive, in a way, on my
Tekumel), I'd be happy to give it.

[Moderator's Note:  Michael Schwartz asks for information on the city of  ]
[                   Fenul.                                                ]

I am midway through the development of my campaign storylines and had 
some questions to pose about the eastern Tsolyanu protectorates. I am 
familiar with Mr. Andrew Lorince's efforts to flesh out Fenul, but 
wonder if others had visited the northeast corner of the Empire and had 
travelers' stories they might wish to share. Anecdotes about the tribes 
of the Kilalammu and Chayengar Ranges (such as the mysterious Horo 
Kanghai), the Dry Bay of Ssu'um, visits to the Hlaka Ruins, etc. are all 
welcome.

Any information on the local climate, natural resources, or native flora 
and fauna found in the Chaigari and Kerunan regions would be very much 
appreciated. Are Tlani Hidallu and Kakri Midallu Peaks wetter and more 
heavily forested on their southern slopes, as might be deduced from the 
"fertile crescent" formed by Gilraya Forest to the southwest and the 
Pechani forest to the southeast? Or is it all "windy wasteland" as 
mentioned in "Adventures on Tekumel"? I suspect the former, if only 
because the Tsolyani have more than once attempted to "liberate" 
northwestern Salarvya from the Salarvyani. The region surely must be 
fertile farming country, and the political agenda ("reunification" of 
former Engsvanyali territories) merely serves as a convenient rationale 
for its seizure. Productive lands generate more taxes for the Imperial 
coffers, after all.

In the main, I wish to know some details about the city of Fenul: population, 
recent history, economy, clan presence, temple presence, legion presence, 
notable personages, fortifications, underworlds, geographic environs and 
layout. Detail comparable to that given for the town of Setnakh or the city 
of Ru would be ideal, so I can begin assembling information packets for my 
players. I am especially interested in Fenul's relationship and history with 
its nearby foreign and nonhuman neighbors: Salarvya, Pechano, Kilalammu, 
Milumanaya, the Hlaka enclaves, and of course Ssuyal. Similar details on the 
city of Hekellu would also be appreciated, if anyone has such.

Fenul is in a rather unenviable position, located as it is on the border 
with Salarvya and Ssuyal, and being at the distant end of a Sakbe road 
which only leads through foreign-held territory. A march of 200 Tsan 
through rough terrain along a hostile southern border to the Sakbe road 
leading south from Sirsum appears to be the only escape route the 
townsfolk have in the event of invasion. I would appreciate any 
observations or theories the community might provide on how these 
circumstances might shape the populace of Fenul. I'd imagine the locals 
have developed a frontier mentality not too far afield from that of the 
fortified towns of Old Mexico, Texas and the American West, circa the 
mid-to-late 1800s.

The provincial map insert found in the Different Worlds edition of the 
Tekumel Sourcebook indicates Fenul as the capital of Chaigari, Hekellu as 
the capital of Kerunan, and Ru as the capital of Ru'anu. The larger maps 
found in Gardasiyal and the Sourcebook contradict this somewhat, placing 
both Ru and Hekellu in Kerunan and Fenul in Chaigari. Am I mistaken about 
this, or do the Tsolyani consider the internal *administrative* boundaries 
and the overall protectorate boundaries to be two different things? Or is 
one map just patently incorrect?

My choice to set my campaign in the distant northeast of Tsolyanu was 
largely based on the fact that I have several Tekumel novices in my 
campaign and the relative calm (relative to the rest of Tsolyanu, at least) 
that region experiences during the civil war will enable me to properly 
initiate them into Tekumelani culture while keeping them busy with the 
realities of invasion by Salarvya and worried about the omnipresent threat 
of Ssuyal. A small pond, to be certain, but the characters can be 
relatively big fish within it and have room to grow.

NOTE: Several of my players are on the list so, if anyone has *seriously* 
juicy revelations to impart, please consider doing so *privately* via 
email... :)

I don't know if people are aware of it, but players in Professor Barker's
Thursday Night Game are a particularly cultured lot.  The recent discussion
of Tekumelani Poetry, for example, comes on the heels of recent poetic 
advances developed just last Thursday.  

The party's resident poet, Arjai hiVaisoner, composed this, his latest sonnet 
in the style of Havlar Beruda of third-cycle Engsvanyali Recidivistists:

   I warned the sweet lass from Sokatis
   "Flee home, and close up your bodice!
   Lest your eager ambition
   For the Fifteenth Position
   Leave you with a sore epiglottis!"

That's how it comes through in transation, of course.  Mere English cannot
convey the rich subtleties of the Tsolyani idioms...

[Moderator's Note:  Stan Rydzewski comments on the Climate of Tekumel.      ]

The climate of Tekumel post sparked a couple of questions in my mind:

>...cities are likely to have a tremendous amount of shade built-in. 
>Porticos, awnings, arbors, extended eaves, colonnades, and pavilions
>are likely to be major parts of the architecture. I would bet many
>cities are similar to Sokatis, where you can walk the length of

>Empires? 

It would seem that shade would be even more desirable on the Sakbe 
roads, unless everyone travels at night.  Do the roads have any 
such provisions, or do travellers have to provide portable shade?  
It would seem that (for part of the day) travelling beside the road, 
on its outer side, would be cooler, albeit less noble, than travelling
on the road.  Given the extreme nature of the heat, it would seem
likely that some people of neglible status would be willing to do
this--if not for comfort's sake, then to save money on water.  Is 
such a thing:

a) unthinkable for social reasons.
b) impractical because of terrain. (I'm sure it is in certain locales.)
c) prevented by the "Sakbe-wardens".
d) feasible

There may be something extremely obvious I'm overlooking here...

If you will put in a good piece of work on the physiognomy, societies,
languages, beliefs, mores, etc. of your nonhumans, I'm tempted to agree
that they may well exist within the Tekumel mythos on one of the planets
that never made it into Tekumel's bubble plane. What you do with them then
is up to you. Do they interact with the inhabitants of Humanspace, or do
they somehow enter into Tekumel's space? What do they know about
technology, and what are their goals and plans? Some of this may affect
Tekumel directly, but a race way over on the opposite side of the galazy
may never even know about the existence of humans. You are welcome, of
course, to devise as many races as you wish, as long as they are not
involved with Tekumel. Since I myself know little about the *present*
inhabitants of Humanspace outside of Tekumel, you can even have your
creatures interact with humans on worlds far from Tekumel. I have no
problems with this. My only wish is that these creatures be rather
thoroughly developed and described before they become "Tekumel-authentic"
material. Nothing worse than the sketchy, pitiful little descriptions one
used to read in science fiction books: "a giant reptile, fangs dripping,
great ophidian eyes seeking its next prey," etc. You have to have some
sophistication before you can build a society and develop space travel. I
am thus bored by such films as the one in which some polar explorers did an
ancient nonhuman out of the ice and reanimate it -- and it then roars,
slavers, kills, mangles, and generally wreaks mindless havoc on all comers.
(I am equally bored by mindless evil demons, Satan, ghosts, etc. -- to be a
successful minion of Satan you'd certainly have to be smart, smooth, and
sexy. Just roaring and munching is simply not enough!)

You are correct. There *are* other species in or adjacent to Humanspace. At
this time they are irrelevant to Tekumel because they cannot interact.
Developing these species might be fun. Then, if they are interesting, they
can be brought in and allowed to have established a small "base" on
Tekumel, as the Shunned Ones have done.

Unlikely that the Engsvanyali would have had pictures or descriptions of
these beings -- the Age of Darkness was so long ago. But they may have
found a medallion or even pages of a magically preserved book (or plate of
gold, which does not decay). My question is then: what would the Tekumelani
think of such a find? Probably attribute it to the iconography of one or
another god or demon. "Nice picture of Morgoblastophor, who inhabits the
XXVIIth Plane of Grumbling Gloom, eh?"

I second Chris. Please do continue your efforts. Send them to Chris. I'll
certainly read them and see how they fit. In all cases, people are welcome
to create additions and modifications of "my" Tekumel; I just cannot accept
them and drop them right in without a lot of thought.

Phil

Hey! I think it's cool. It's one thing to play with "modern" Tekumel
itself.

Too often this is done badly, or just as frustratingly perhaps, superseded
by a later document. 

But the pre-cataclysmic times . . . .
Well, I say go for it!! All those star systems and such, there's got to be
some bizarre thingies that never made it to Tekumel. 

Why not share the details of these thingies if you have the time.

[Moderator's Note:  Peter Huston offers up some material for campaigns.     ]

Plants , Creatures and other Stuff from Ye Olde Tekumel Campaigne. 

Greetings! Like many of us on this list, I seem to have slipped into a
phase of my life that does not actually include role playing games.
Nevertheless, curiously, my interest in Tekumel continues -kept active by
the quality of material, not so much the need for it. 

Most of the material I created for this game was when I was in my teens
and early twenties, over ten years ago. I've decided to share bits and
pieces of it with the list. I shall do so in drips and drabs as I expect it
will make things more interesting and relaxed for all concerned. In a
spirit of nostalgia, I have decided not to edit my own creations, but to
repeat them as is and share them as created back then. Looking at them
again, there are some that I personally would not use in my own campaign
today but thought were quite good back when I wrote them down in my
notebook. Some I can see that I copied from some other source. Its possibly
that I might have slipped up and copied and then forgotten. It's been a
while. Please point out any borrowings or plagiarisms, if I don't catch
them and have forgotten. I would be honored if some were declared
"official", but might I suggest that some might merely be, at best,
"Tsolyani Folklore", perhaps. Things many Tsolyani believe to exist, but do
not?  And some, I suppose just won't exist at all, even in the wildest
imaginations of the most ignorant and nave Jakallan slum dweller. 

Alas, Alas. . . .

In some cases, I'll share the EPT stats I created, but in most cases I
don't think there's much need for this.  Lets start with the plants as
that's where some people's minds have been lately. 


PLANTS (I don't seem to have named the plants for some reason. There's
one other plant, but I specified it was only found in the Mihalli ruins, so
I'll include it some other day.)

Touching causes poison throw at 3 or death. If surprise there is a 1/6

PLANT # 1. 

Large pot surrounded by large leafy fronds. Entering area causes a saving
throw versus poison. If failed character wanders around hallucinating for
six turns then  approaches the plant and goes to sleep. After an hour the
character will be wrapped up by the large leaves. He/She will then lose 12
hit points a day. After he/she reaches 6 hits revification is impossible. 


PLANT # 2. 

(There's a pencil drawing in the notebook. Basically,  and it's tough to
describe, the plant has many stems, At the end of each stem is a pointed
kind of pod. One of the pods has "shot its load" and has its pointed
portion attached to the end of the pod by a long thread. There appears to
be a central nod which I later seem to refer to as the "brain" of the
plant.)

[Moderator's Note:  James Maliszewski recounts a recent adventure.         ]

Having enjoyed the tales of others' adventures on Tekumel, I thought it only
right that I should share one of my own.

The following is a very brief summary of events from the first adventure of
a new campaign for my own "Monday Night Group." I offer my apologies to
Patrick Brady of London, England for shamelessly "borrowing" from an
adventure idea that he sent to me while we were developing Khirgar for an
article in "Seal of the Imperium."

Dramatis Personae:
Shemek hiVraisanu - an amateur archaeologist and devotee of Thumis
Achan hiVraisanu - a professional duelist who views swordplay as an art
Aruken hiArusa - an artist and priest of Avanthe
Balesh hiSoruna - a priest of Qon

The characters described above are all members of the Golden Dawn clan, a
medium ranked clan of the city of Khirgar. The characters had returned to
their clanhouse for the celebration of the wedding of their clan-cousin,
Sanjesh, to a young clan girl of the powerful Golden Sunburst clan. This
impending marriage was considered a major coup for Golden Dawn, as it gave
the clan further respectability by aligning itself with the respected Golden
Sunburst. Sanjesh was the "fair-haired boy" of the clan, being a
high-ranking bureaucrat within Khirgar's Palace of War. His marriage would
secure Golden Dawn an important place in the city's politics.

Unfortunately, by the time that the characters arrived at their clanhouse,
things had gone badly awry. Sanjesh was under suspicion because of the theft
of silver ingots from Imperial payroll to the legions and the marriage was
in danger of being called off. Sanjesh, they learned, was not necessarily
under suspicion for the actual theft of the ingots, but, barring the capture
of the actual thief, he would be held responsible, as the guardianship of
the legions' payroll was his responsibility. Negligence in this matter
carried the same penalty as complicity: death.

Naturally, the characters decided to uncover the actual thief and clear
their clan-cousin's good name (and save his marriage). They immediately
assumed that Sanjesh or the clan had to have enemies who would want to frame
him. This proved to be a good insight, but they took a long time to realize
precisely why an enemy would wish to do so. They concentrated on rather high
level theories: preventing the alliance between Golden Dawn and Golden
Sunburst, an underling who wanted Sanjesh's job, a dismissed member of the
bureaucracy, even agents provocateur from neighboring states.

Consequently, they spent much time questioning bureaucrats and members of
other clans in a vain attempt to make sense of the case. They were further
baffled by two facts: 1) How the theft could have been carried out, since
Imperial payrolls are guarded zealously under extreme conditions and 2) how
the theft had been uncovered. The latter they learned occurred because an
internal auditor of the Palace of War, a member of the Black Hood clan, had
instituted a random check of the crates containing the silver ingots. He
found that three ingots had been stolen from one crate and feared that
others had been similarly removed. The characters were naturally suspicious
of this Hru'u devotee. They wondered why he had chosen to institute a spot
check at this particular time. After all, he must have had it in for their
cousin. As it turned out, he was simply vigilant and heavily influenced by
his personal astrologer, who assured him now was a good time to act as he
did. Despite his religious affiliation, he had nothing to do with the plot.

The characters had limited access to the Palace of War. They learned through
their few contacts (actually, their cousin's) that the treasury of the
Palace is heavily guarded day and night. Only verified personnel, soldiers
and slaves, are allowed in or out and they only do so with permission. The
treasury has only one narrow door and no windows. Someone stealing three
silver ingots (or more -- at this time, it was unclear how many had been
stolen. Later, they would learn that only three had indeed been stolen.
Again, why only three?) would be detected very easily. Furthermore, there
was a record of everyone who went in or out of the treasury. Sanjesh was, of
course, among them, but then so were many others.

They did discover that the treasury also contained ceremonial armor and
weaponry to be used in the recent Litany of Noble Deeds ceremonies in
Khirgar. They also learned that these items were commonly moved in and out
of the treasury. In short order, they suspected that the ingots may have
been concealed in one of the crates bearing these ceremonial items. The
question remained how the ingots were removed from their crates without
anyone knowing and, more importantly, who did so and why.

An interrogation of some slaves and an examination of Palace records
indicated that one crate of ingots was damaged while being moved. As is
standard procedure, the crate was replaced and sealed again. The characters
rightly assumed that whoever was present during this rare accident might
well be their suspect. A further examination of records narrowed down the
list of candidates to a Tirrkimau named Mridak. Mridak, it seemed, was
commander of the guard unit the night of the accident. He also had a suit of
armor lodged in the treasury for use in the Litany. All that remained was a
motive.

The characters' initial thoughts weren't far from the truth. Mridak had a
grudge against Sanjesh because Mridak had hoped to marry Sanjesh's intended.
Unfortunately, there was little genuine chance of this. Unlike Sanjesh,
Mridak had little career success and not much to offer even a minor clan
girl of Golden Sunburst. He stole the ingots not for material gain (he could
hardly use them -- they had an Imperial payroll stamp on them), but as
revenge against Sanjesh for destroying what he falsely believed was his only
chance for happiness.

The characters carefully collected their evidence and turned Mridak into the
authorities. He had left Khirgar on a "hunting expedition" with his
clan-brothers, but he was caught nonetheless. The ingots were recovered and
Sanjesh's name cleared. The marriage went on as planned and everyone drank
and celebrated appropriately.


Naturally, a great deal more happened than I could record here.
Nevertheless, the adventure was enjoyable and served as a nice introduction
to Tekumel to a couple of my players who were unfamiliar with it.

I'll post additional summaries if time and interest (both yours and mine)
permit.

[Moderator's Note:  James Maliszewski reports on his new web site.          ]

I have placed a very preliminary website, called "The Jade Arch" online. Its
URL is www.interlog.com/~maliszew/jade.html.

At the present time, there's very little on the site. This should change
within a week or so, as I have a fair amount of material to place online.

In case anyone should wonder, the website will consist of the following
areas:

Skein of Destiny - update notification page
Deeds of Glory - rules and rules-related material for any Tekumel system,
but with an emphasis on Gardasiyal
Adventures on Tekumel - scenario and campaign ideas, as well as NPC and
setting descriptions
Cup of Subadim the Sorcerer - downloadable material of various sorts, such
as character sheets and other play aids
Tubeways - links to every known Tekumel web site

I would be very grateful if anyone has material that they'd like to add to
the site. As it stands now, most of the material that will be placed online
will pertain to my own campaign in the northwest of the Imperium. I'd be
more than happy to expand this to include other's material and credit their
contribution.

I don't intend (nor do I have the resources to do so) to compete with the
Blue Room ftp site for material. The emphasis of "the Jade Arch" is
roleplaying, nothing more. Consequently, everything included in it must
further roleplaying on Tekumel and not be merely an elaboration on the
setting for its own sake. There's already enough information on Tekumel as a
setting. I want more material to encourage gaming in Tekumel.

I am sure that there are errors on the site, small though it is. Please
point them out to me, as I'd like to iron out all of its current flaws
before putting the new material online.

[Moderator's Note:  Ted Lyng asks about Tekumel in other Languages.       ]

Bruce Roberts has done a wonderful job compiling a comprehensive Tekumel
Products list.  I wonder, though, if there are Tekumel materials out
there in languages other than English (and Tekumel languages)?

Chirs has said that list subscribers live in many different countries.
A search of "Tekumel" on Yahoo turns up German, Finnish, Japanese, and
other non-English pages.  Has Professor Barker ever licensed
translations of any of his Tekumel works?  Are any list members aware of
non-English 'zine articles or other items?

While we are on the subject of unknown Tekumel materials.  I recall
reading somewhere that before the publication of EPT, Professor Barker
wrote stories for science fiction magazines.  Is this true? Were any of
these Tekumel-related?

Thanks -- Ted Lyng

[Moderator's Note:  The question came in anonymously.  It ponders the      ] 
                    "reality" of Tekumel.                                  ]

We Tekumel afficionados often ask "Is this 'real Tekumel'?"  I have a
slightly different question: "Is Tekumel real?"

Three things to ponder:

1) Certain Details.  Professor Barker's ability to visualize Tekumel
goes beyond human powers of imagination.  His ability to look into
Tekumel more resembles what he has called (in one of the netbooks)
"skrying."   Professor Barker's ability to trace Tekumelani families and
verbally sketch flora and fauna exceeds in volume and consistency what a
person could invent.  Of course, he cannot always explain certain
mechanics like how Hlaka can fly and why Shunned Ones breathe foul air,
just as you and I could not explain how a humming bird flies backward or
an electric eel shocks its prey.  These lacunae make the descriptions of
Tekumel more compellingly "realistic," not less.

2) Certain Coincidences.  Reading through the Blue Room messages, one
can find several cases of Professor Barker's saying, "How did you know
about X hiY?  I've never mentioned him/her in my writings."  Or, more
prosaically, how many times has he said in response to someone else's
description of a completely unexplored aspect of Tekumel, "Exactly
right."  Strange, that other people are poking through to what seems to
be exactly the same plane.

3)  Certain Feelings.  A few days ago I was outside just before dusk.
On one side the overcast sky was glowing a bright pinkish orange.  On
the other side, very deep blue patches were showing through scattered
puffy white clouds.  Overhead, lightning was quietly crackling (no
thunder for some reason) in big webs across the top of the sky, overlaid
across a rainbow.  Just as I was watching this weird beautiful sky, a
man and a woman walked by speaking a language I didn't understand
(Keralan/Malayalam, I think).   The strangeness and beauty of this scene
jolted me out of my usual everyday torpor, and I thought "this happens
in the south near Jakalla."  I haven't shaken this feeling.  I've
communicated with other people who've had similar feelings (though with
far different details).  Are we reaching through?

I am reminded of the "Quarterdeck" chapter of Moby Dick where Ahab
compares external reality to a "pasteboard mask" and says in his search
for the white whale he pierces through to what is beyond.

I have a few other thoughts that follow from the speculation that
Tekumel might be real (including why I hope it's not), but the above is
perhaps enough to start a discussion.

[                   about the fate of Trinesh hiKetkolel from Flamesong.  ]

>When last we saw Hereksa Trinesh hiKetkolel of the Legion of the

>"I intend to be a general myself someday."

Flamesong ends as the Yan Koryani war is entering its final phase.
Dhich'une has  not made his move and taken the throne; Mirusiya is still in
Yan Kor (or was it Milumanaya?) on the eastern front; Eselne was in Kai in
Pijjena.  I don't have my date-list in hand right now -- can anybody help
with the year/month? I know several of you kind folks have maintained a
chronology.

Trinesh hiKetkolel is now a Kasi (Captain), serving as a detached Liaison
officer in Avanthar. He is popular with Mirusiya's courtiers and followers.
He has married a young girl, a daughter of the old nobility, and has been
granted a small fief and a pretty villa near Aukesha. They have a new baby
son. Trinesh is politically well on his way to becoming a general -- but
that's another story...!

[Moderator's Note:  Michael Schwartz asks about comets and meteors in      ]
[                   Tekumel's bubble of space.                             ]

As I have said, I am *not* an astronomer -- nor a mathematician, nor a
scientist, nor any other kind of specialist (outside of some anthropology
and some linguistics -- and a lot of adventures when I was younger and more
healthy!).

>Poring over the vast body of astronomical lore on the Tuleng system, I

Comets (from outside Tekumel's system) are, of course, no longer possible
-- the "bubble plane" that contains Tekumel cannot admit anything other
than what it is already within it.

Asteroids and smaller bodies still exist, but these are the ones that are
too small to be seen without a telescope -- meteors are still occasionally
seen. Most of the larger bodies in the inner system were cannibalised for
resources with which to terraform the planet. Some were just removed as
"traffic hazards" by the pre-Time of Darkness authorities, When Tekumel was
sent over into its bubble plane, a few apparently fell into Tuleng, without
doing much damage.

There are actually a few ancient satellites still in orbit. One can see
them going across the sky in the proper latitudes. The Tsolyani refer to
them as "Lesser Demons."

>It also seems suspect to me that the Tuleng system did not see the
>formation of any Jovian planetary bodies, and even more suspect that

The terraformers eliminated whatever outer giant planets there had been:
they were useful for various metals, gases, chemicals, etc. When Tekumel
entered its own plane, all other debris in the outer system was left
behind. I suspect you are quite correct in what you have theorised.

An interesting tale comes to mind here: the Llyani once managed to
translate a small portion of one of the books of the Latter times. This
mentioned a "great wizard" who so offended the Demon Origob that the latter
"hurled him high into the heavens" and placed him in a "little egg" in a
sea of black darkness. The wizard is in stasis and thus never ages or wakes.
This is supposed to have happened *before* the Time of Darkness, back when
somebody might have found him and rescued him. Now he just orbits Tuleng,
quite unreachable and unknowable. He has no way back, and there are no
ships to come and get him. What an unpleasant surprise if he ever does wake 
up.

>Essentially, my question is this: have the modern inhabitants of Tekumel

As said above: meteor showers do happen -- but small ones! There are
records of such "Lesser Demons" in all of the Five Empires. Aside from
causing Chlen-beasts to drop their calves prematurely, giving zits to young
maidens, and  causing geysers in the Spouting Mountains of Livyanu to erupt
at the wrong times, no other effects upon human affairs have been noted.

I think it is only the Shen who have postulated that these "Lesser Demons"
are actually small "planets" made of stone, metal, etc. Of course, few
humans ever believe a Shen scientist!

[Moderator's Note:  Brett Slocum asks about the creative idea behind the   ]
[                   Tomb Police.                                           ]

>Does the idea of Tomb Police come from some historical culture? If so,
>does a reference exist to this?

Tomb Police were found in ancient Egypt, where they served with some
efficiency until the weakening of central power in the New Kingdom. Tomb
robberies became more and more common, although it is thought that they had
been going on since time immemorial: Khufu's Great Pyramid is supposed to
have been looted in ancient times, as were the tombs of most of the
pharoahs. Tutankhamun's tomb was entered, but the tomb police found out,
inspected it, and resealed it.

The Egyptians also paid priests to serve as the staff of mortuary temples.
These were separate from the actual tombs, often near the Nile and
connected to the pyramid, etc. by a causeway. These mortuary temples served
as a place for relatives and others to bring food offerings and other
goodies, Some of these contingents of priests lasted for a couple hundred
years or more.

I suppose this is *my* starting point for the tomb police of Tekumel,
although I prefer the dictum of the Engsvanyali priest of Belkhanu, Ravinan
of Thraya: "Let the Excellent Dead be carefully guarded; who knows when the
Circle of their lives will come round again?" After death, one passes to
the Isles of Teretane, according to Lord Belkhanu's theologians; after an
undefined period of "wandering," each dead person returns to this Plane to
live yet another life. Some say this happens only once; others say the
cycle is endless. But in any case, a reborn dead person would not be happy
to see that his previous body had been disinterred, dishonoured, stripped
of its possessions, and thrown to the dogs! Many Tsolyani are convinced
that "ghosts" can still take revenge upon perpetrators of hostile deeds and
their families and their descendants for milllennia to come.

[Moderator's Note:  Rick Sauter asks about Mirusiya's throne name.  I take the]
[                   opportunity to ask the Professor to give us a news update ]
[                   about Tsolyanu.                                           ]

>Rick Sauter asks about Mirusiya.  It would probably be a good time to 
>summarize what is going on since the Kolumejalim.  Can you provide the 
>info?

Mirusiya is now esconced in the Golden Tower. (Bob Alberti: can you give an
exact date? Keith? Hello?) Prince Eselne had died of his wounds suffered in
Pijjena during the war and never completely healed. Prince Rereshqala
resigned the Gold and has become the High Chancellor in Avanthar. He spends
many boring hours trying to make sense of the Imperial bureaucracy when
he'd rather be enjoying his lovely wife, Sogai, or puttering with his
collection of antiquities.

Prince Taksuru also resigned the Gold to take on the richly rewarding (as
in gold and gems and goodies) task of being High Princeps of the Palace of
the Priesthoods. His functions are largely ceremonial, but he has
aspirations of becoming a scholar -- and possibly leaving Tsolyanu to
travel and explore.

Ma'in Kruthai lives in Tumissa, where she occasionally sees Princess
Arimala, the sculptress. Ma'in also gave up the Gold -- no sense fighting a
battle you are *sure* to lose -- but she has spurned Mirusiya's offers of
pleasant (and harmless) Imperial posts. She is currently having a fling
with a whole school of Hirilakte gladiators -- about 30 men, 8 women, and a
gaggle of Shen. She is beginning to age a bit -- "used" may be a better
term for it.

The nation is slowly getting its act together again. The forces of Lord
Sarku managed to spirit Dhich'une completely off the plane to one of the
alternate ones surrounding Tekumel, but he hopes to return one day. His
minions are working to undermine and replace the followers of other sects.
For example, Lord Sanjesh hiKirisaya, of Usenanu, returned home to find the
Sarku Priest Elon hiTlelsu had occupied his mansion and used magical
methods to make people think *he* was Sanjesh, Sanjesh' wife, A'is, was
replaced by Elon's female counterpart, Ke'ela, who may not be very human.
Elon went through a faked "conversion" over to the temple of Sarku and is
currently having a great hall for the worship of the Worm Lord built on
Sanjesh' land. Sanjesh himself felt he could not trust anybody and fled to
Hauma, where he now has a job in the Palace of the Realm there as a scribe,
writing copies of contracts and bureaucratic letters.

>We are wondering if the new Emperor has chosen his throne name yet?

He has, but there was some theological point about it that bothered his
advisors, and he now has opted for "The Flame Everlasting." Rereshqala
likes "The Flame Ascending," and others have made still other suggestions.

>Also, the Sakbe road that goes north from Jakalla to Usenanu crosses the
>Mssuma River at the great bend. Is this crossing a ferry system or bridge
>structure?  When the Sakbe roads cross larger rivers, what is the common
>method used? That is, can one usually assume a bridge or ferries?

There is a ferry system. The river is too wide to bridge, and every year
the inundation also moves the banks of the river one way or the other for
various distances, A bridge that is effective one year may have one or both
ends in the water away from the shore next year! The transport clans handle
caravan shipments, carts, travellers, and other traffic with some
efficiency. Just go down to the ferry quay on either side of the river, and
you'll be besieged with boatmen trying to be hired to take you across.
Don't pay more than 7-9 Hlash, however -- and don't pay the rascals on the
other bank who claim to be "river-crossing tax collectors!. Caravans and
carts do have to pay a tax, collected by officials who operate from small
buildings on the quays -- but travellers without commercial cargo pay
nothing.

Phil

[Moderator's Note:  Bob Alberti responds to the question about climate and ]
[                   how it affects travel on the Sakbe roads.              ]

>It would seem that shade would be even more desirable on the Sakbe 
>roads, unless everyone travels at night.  Do the roads have any 
>such provisions, or do travellers have to provide portable shade?  

Every few Tsan there are road-towers straddling the causeway, and everyone
has to pass through them.  These are military defenses built of heavy stone
and are large, spacious, and considerably cooler than being out in the
sunlight.

Some of them have water or else are served by locals who carry water and
provisions out to sell.

At the top of the entrance ramps leading to the rural roads are 
marketplaces.  The booths and stalls are lightweight and portable, built
of wood and fabric for the most part.  They have extensive awnings of
brightly-colored fabric which cast an alluring shade.  Once under the awning
you should be prepared to buy something, however, or endure the berating
of the stall-owner.

And you can buy broad-brimmed hats to wear on the road.  I've never seen
anything akin to an umbrella, although of course if you are high clan you 
have teams of slaves who carry poles suspending a fabric awning over you as
you walk.

Hats and awnings, towers and wives, no matter how many are going to St. Ives
you're still not going to travel in the hottest part of the day, especially
during the summer.  You mostly fetch up for siesta under a tower or make 
a camp with awnings somewhere off the road or under a tree.

>It would seem that (for part of the day) travelling beside the road, 
>on its outer side, would be cooler, albeit less noble, than travelling
>on the road.

This would work about as well as trying to parallel a major freeway by
driving on the side-streets through the neighborhoods it passes.  There
are often footpaths and such, but there are also croplands, rocks, streams,
and the occasional underbrush preventing such easy passage.

>a) unthinkable for social reasons.
>b) impractical because of terrain. (I'm sure it is in certain locales.)
>c) prevented by the "Sakbe-wardens".
>d) feasible

It differs from place to place.  In the central empire the terrain around the
Sakbe roads is highly populated and for short distances you could choose
between taking the Sakbe road or taking a side road.  In the more outlying
parts of the empire the Sakbe road is often the only practical way to get
from place to place.  Of course you can travel on the river rather than
walking if such is available.  Or, if you're a Great and Powerful Magic 
User like the legendary Lord Osumetlu (Allelujah Chorus:  "OH-su-met-lu!") 
of Usenanu ("Uuu-se-na-nu!") you can simply fly.  At night.  In the dark.

[Moderator's Note:  Kevin King asks for some tips on running a Tekumel based]
[                   adventure for the first time.  I'll collect and post a  ]
[                   single collection of responses.                         ]

I'm a new list member though I have been lurking for a while.  There's a
gaming con coming up in the area I live (around Phoenix, AZ) and I may be
gaming there depending on time and motivation.  Rather than run yet another
session of AD&D or White Wolf, I thought about trying my hand at EPT.

Here's where you come in.  I'm too new to the game to attempt to run a high
politics scenario in Bey Su.  The names, relationships and machinations are a
bit bewildering at this point.  Consequently, the scenario will have to be set
in a backwater province away from the attention and influence of the empire.  

Despite this restriction, I feel it would be a miscarriage of the game to
create a scenario that could appear in any other rpg.  To avoid this and to
represent the game as accurately as possible I would like suggestions as to a
"typical" Tekumel session.  

I have read the three solo adventures and have made it through about 1/3 of
your voluminous digests (made available by Chris).  I have the Gardasiyal
boxed set and the separate character generation system.  I intend to
pregenerate characters and use the simplified combat system.  

What I would like from the list are a few posts describing a typical EPT
gaming session.  What is the structure of a scenario in Tekumel?  What is the
pace?  How much emphasis is placed on role play as opposed to game play?  The
scenario I will construct, but, as I have never played EPT with an experienced
group, I lack a sense of the appropriate tone and mood for the game.  Any
comments welcome.  Thanks.
