These messages are the accumulation of the messages that were sent out on 
the Blue Room email list between May 1995 and June 2000.  A large portion 
of the information is directly from Professor M.A.R Barker. When the list 
members joined during the time the list was active, they agreed to refrain 
from sharing this data with non list members.  When the list ended, it was 
urged that the data be made available to non-list Tekumel fans, and it 
seemed like a good idea all around.

I only ask that if you download these digests, or have received them in 
some other way, please respect the agreements the list members made, and 
refrain from passing them around and instead point people to the Tekumel 
web site, www.tekumel.com so that they can download them for themselves, 
and see all the other material available on the Tekumel.com web site.

Many Thanks.

NEW TEKUMEL PBEM CAMPAIGN SEEKING LIVE SUBJECTS

Travelers -- do you want to take a vacation to an exotic land, but don't
know where to go?  Livyanu, pestilent and occupied by stuffy Mu'ugalavyani
-- no; Mu'ugalavya, home of the stuffy Mu'ugalavyani -- no; Yan Kor and the
North, cold, dirty, and backwards -- no; Salarvya, hot, noisome, and
generally distasteful --  no, no, no, ladies and gentlemen, the destination
for you is lovely, quaint Mletpauk!  Located in the scenic highlands of
Vra, the town of Mletpauk has been a favorite destination of discriminating
sightseers and tourists for the last 24,000 years.  Cool, refreshing
mountain air -- mysterious caves -- picturesque ruins -- friendly natives
-- holy relics and shrines -- invigorating mineral springs -- souvenirs to
die for -- strange cuisine -- and more!  Experience foreign barbarity at
its best, all without leaving the comforts of Tsolyanu!

Loyal servant of the Empire?  Your patriotism and paperwork is desperately
needed in the town of Mletpauk (Mlet District, Sine Province, Island of
Vra).   The duplicitous inhabitants, protected by an unfortunate series of
treaties, are denying themselves the benefit of rigorous Imperial rule!
Inbred secessionist nobles and power-mad petty theocrats infringe gleefully
on the rights and dignities of the Petal Throne; meanwhile, the alarmingly
over-privileged Mayor is selected by an absurd rigmarole of so-called
"reincarnation"!  The district administration is not only isolated and
understaffed, but corrupt and crippled by vicious bureaucratic infighting
-- and needs your help *now*!

Looking for a good time?  Come to Mletpauk!  Consistently ranked among the
ten most depraved cities in the Five Empires, the loud and lurid resort
town of Mletpauk recognizes 69 official festivals and is home to literally
*millions* more informal revelries every day of the year!  Drink 180-proof
jungle liquors while you win and lose fortunes at Tekumel's *only*
48-Kiren-a-day casino!  Frolic with depraved maidens, youths, and Things of
the Temple of Hrihayal!  Greet the ugliness of dawn from Tsolyanu's
cleanest gutters!  (Psst!  You wanna score some "green," kid?  Come to
Mletpauk!  It's shipped fresh from -- you know -- that *other* island out
there.)

Dusty bookworm?  Would-be sage?  Aspiring scholar?  Struggling savant?
Whatever the case may be, you don't know nothing until you've gotten to the
bottom of Mletpauk!  Old ruins -- modern ruins -- eerie caverns -- sealed
pre-Engsvanyali libraries -- Ksarulian academies -- unique autochthonous
language -- fine stationery and writing accessories -- buried temples --
mutant flora and fauna -- mutant local population -- savage tribal customs
-- bizarre local folklore -- curious aboriginal rites -- banned bookstores
-- renegade sorcerers -- inexpensive midnight oil -- crazy mystics -- mad
scientists -- headquarters of the Semi-Ecumenical All-Empire Demonological
Conference Organizational Committee -- earn credit towards your doctorate
in the forbidden sciences while you live the good life in Mletpauk!

Gladiator?  Duellist?  Soldier?  Mercenary?  Army officer?  Mletpauk is
definitely the place for you.  The locals are small and easy to whup, but
there sure are a lot of the treacherous feuding little fellers!  Don't
forget the homesick imperial garrison, the preening city guard, the creepy
tomb police, the swaggering temple guardsmen, the ululating Pachi Lei
berserkers, the rampaging youth gangs, the poison-tipped tribesmen, the
belligerent tourists, and last but not least, the helpful bystanders!   Let
Tekumel's finest storm drains wash away the blood of your vanquished foes!
Compete in the Mayor's own Ad Hoc Extremely Dangerous Sports Meets!
Recuperate in Mletpauk's famous teaching hospital!

Assassin?  Trying to avoid one?  Either way, Mletpauk is where you want to
be!  This quiet, peace-loving little town has *no* professional assassin
clans and boasts the lowest rate of violent crime in the entire Empire.
(Based on partial records compiled by the Palace of the Realm for the last
available year, 1717 A.S.)

Religious maniacs of all sorts -- go to Mletpauk!  Aboriginal bumpkins and
sly heretics have perverted the true teachings of your holy faith!
Guaranteed!   A devotee of Change, but feeling lonely in the Islands?  Come
to Mletpauk, a refreshing fountain of chaos amidst tedious Vrayani-Gangan
Stability!  A well-wisher of the Worm, perhaps?  Then you're needed in
Mletpauk, Emperor Dhich'une's one potential beachhead in the south.  Or are
you a fan of the Tlomitlanyal?  Make a pilgrimage to the sacred relics and
shrines of your deity in Mletpauk -- and restore them to their rightful
place in the Skein of things!  (Sick of the Pariah Gods, anyone?  Then try
Mletpauk!  No Goddess of the Pale Bone or *DOUBLE* your money back!)

Espiocrats and shadowy schemers!  Are all the good suicidal missions in
your secret society/political faction/O.A.L. task force already taken?
Looking for a sinister plot to please your faceless masters?  What you need
is a trip to Mletpauk!  Never heard of the place?  That *proves* what a
hotbed of baroque intrigue it is!  Why else would you-know-who have gone to
such lengths to make it seem so obscure?

Are you a vapid, idle aristocrat?  Martial law and those tiresome
squabbling Imperial heirs getting you down?  Come to secluded,
politics-free Mletpauk!  Guaranteed not to give a hoot about the
Kolumejalimyal!  Haunt of famous artists and poets since Yetil's day!
Ferocious and tasty beasts to hunt and kill!  For the angler, gigantic fish
and other aquatic life-forms come looking for *you*!  Buy trinkets with
unlooked-for properties!  Let those boring old Princes and Princesses slug
it out while you continue to bleed your tenant farmers dry -- all from the
safety and comfort of every highborn parasite's favorite backwater!

No?  Are you perchance a despicable foreigner? Come to Mletpauk!  The
hospitable, open-minded citizens of this town in North Vra welcome all
foreigners -- except the *South* Vrayani, of course.  (It's also source of
the best forged passports, visas, and citizenship papers this side of
Avanthar!)

Take advantage of this unique offer today and sign up for a visit to Mletpauk!

A campaign set in the early 2360s and adhering closely to "official"
history, but generally limited to smaller-scale, lower-power goings-on.
Specific plotline(s) will be shaped to fit participants' interests, with as

I'm looking for a commitment to one or two turns per week from each
participant.  Play can start when I have at least 3 players; latecomers
should easily be able to join in even after the campaign storyline gets
rolling.  I hereby swear that this WILL get off the ground and that I SHALL
drag everyone kicking and screaming into the second round of play, and then

[                   Saturday.  Jack continues his story started in 342.      ]

We finally recuperated our strength, and determined to venture through
the portal better equipped than yesterday's debacle. We took sufficient
supplies to last at least a week, and a good selection of other
necessities - ropes, torches, etc.

Fulat the Scribe didn't even come to see us off. He did send a message
via Kurshetl to say that he had pressing business. (Is he a tailor too?)

When we got to the nexus point we found the chamber guarded by Zorel's
men, and the portal still open and stable. Kurshetl used some sorcery or
other to see whether the other side of the gateway was safe or not. It
was, so we progressed through, and made a somewhat undignified landing
on a beach somewhere, as the exit was some three feet up in the air.

The sea was a strange green colour, and the sky had a reddish hue, like
a Jakalla sunset, though it was clearly midday. I suspected we were not
in Tekumel.

There was a boat pulled up on the beach, and as I approached it a small,
furry figure ran off into the forest behind the beach. Several of the
party followed it and I stayed on the beach. After a few minutes a ship
came into view over the horizon, heading towards the beach.

As the ship came inshore it dropped some small boats, and we saw that
the boats were full of furry figures similar to the one wqe had seen
earlier. They looked somewhat similar to Renyu, but larger.

They spoke no tongue any of us understood, so it is a good Kushetl was
there with his sorcery. He made it clear that we wished them no harm,
and that we were  merely pursuing a man like us dressed in brown robes.
This description seemed to ring some bells, and we were taken aboard the
ship and rowed to a volcanic island some miles away.

As we approached the island the stench of sulphur grew, and the heat
became almost unbearable.  We saw several flying creatures in the sky,
which Kurshetl pronounced to be either Winged Serpents of the
Conflagration or Flame Dragons. Either way I was starting to wish we
were somewhere else.

We landed on the island and were taken into a large chamber past several
bronze-skinned warriors, and two or three enormous burning beings. The
Renyu-like creatures were also evident about the  place, though they
usually seemed to be somewhat inferior to the other beings.

We were met by a serpent creature which spoke appalling Tsolyani with a
lisp. Obviously his teacher wasn't that worried about grammar either, as
he used phhrases and constructions that wouldn't be out of place on the
lips of a Pala Jakallan dock-slave. He did not seem at all pleased to
see us, and if it were not for the intervention of one of his rivals
with his master, he would have had us all killed immediately. This, it
seems is because we are the same race as "The Brown One", who was highly
placed in the organization of their enemies, the Writhing Ones. He also
seems to have arrived here some months ago, so it would seem that the
Streams of Time flow much faster here. I hope we do not stay too long
here, or else we will have changed beyond recognition when we return
home.

We were taken to see the Master, who it seems is a Demon Lord, though I
dared not look at him when we were in the throne chamber. I remember
very little of what transpired at the audience. After it we were shown
quarters, and soon thereafter one of the Blazing Warriors came in and
started to boast of how he saved our lives by interceding with
Jneksha'a, and how noble he was being not having Kurshetl killed out of
hand despite the fact that he had been murdered on at least two
occasions by him (Bashrugi by Kurshetl, that is). After he started to
talk about us individually I realized that I knew him (it). It was my
old comrade-in-arms, Bashrugi, though he looked a bit different last
time I saw him. His ego was unmistakable, though.

The story behind all the goings-on here is this - or at least Bashrugi's
version of it:

The natives of this plane are the furry creatures, called Jaghroth, or
something similar. One faction of these was being attacked by another,
who were followers of the Writhing Ones. The oppressed faction were
doing poorly until some minions of Jneksha'a arrived and discovered that
their enemies were common, so they lent support to them. The Writhing
Ones started to lose the war; or at least that was until the arrival of
the Brown One, who created an army of undead warriors for the Writhing
Ones to use.

The main problem that Jneksha'a's forces have is that the plane is
mostly sea, full of islands over which the two sides battle for control.
Unfortunately none of the combatants have much idea how to wage war at
sea, or any idea of tactics when on land (the Blazing Warriors make the
Legion of the Lord of the Red Devastation look like tactical geniuses).

The main reason we are still alive is that we have skills that they need
to help them turn around the war. Unfortunately my personal abilities do
not match up with their needs, so I'm pretty much redundant at the
moment, and I can tell you that it's pretty boring sat around a barren
volcanic rock with nobody for company but Kurshetl. Still, I hear
they're planning a raid in the next couple of days to test out their new
tactics, so I might volunteer just to relieve the monotony. I'll report
on the event when I get back.

[Moderator's Note:  Dale Robertson shares how his Tekumel has evolved, at   ]
[                   least in terms of its zoology.  This is of course, as   ]
[                   Dale says, his Tekumel.                                 ]

OOPS!  I'm a biologist with an advanced degree - get out your notebooks,
'cause there's a short quiz at the end of this lecture.  I recall seeing 
a comment in a previous volume about a zoologist shedding some insight 
on the natural history of Tekumel.  This is an extension of a brief phone
conversation I had with Prof. Barker some months back where this subject
indeed came up.

In my own EPT campaigns, which have evolved independently over the last 
ten or so years, this is the actuality of Tekumel's biology.  Some 
liberties have to be taken.  For example, the legends about the coming 
of humanity to Tekumel and conflicts with the Foes of Man are fairly 
accurate, but like all stories over time, elements are lost or changed.  

Only a few of the critters listed in the rules are non-Terrestrial:  
Ngoro, Nyagga, the Food of the Ssu, etc.  Everything else is derived 
from terrestrial stock that has been altered through mutation or design 
over the millennia or artificially-created life forms.

The majority of the "animals" in the current bestiary are hexapodal
(six-legged) and three-eyes (at least in the drawings).  Two common
mutations I have run across are extra limbs and extra eyes.  After a 
nuclear war, these types of mutations would be fairly common.  Later, 
once the science of genetics was reacquired, modifications could occur 
for reasons ranging from aesthetics to functionality.  Some of the 
creatures may well have come from other worlds, but it was by way of 
Earth.  Other quadrupedal creatures (Shen, etc.) are in fact derived 
from terrestrial organisms modified through genetic engineering, biotech-
nology, nanotechnology, etc.  A summary is provided below (if anyone is 
interested, I can get them the complete information).

Beings Descended from Humanity:
Humans (rather obvious)
Swamp Folk (humans with four legs and a fin on their heads)
Heheganu and Hehecharu
Ssu (really!  they are descended from humans modified for zero-G
environments.  They lost their original origin, settled Tekumel as their
own, adapted their bodies to feed on the indigenous life, then later were
invaded by humans etc.  Humanity, either not recognizing or not caring, 
came into conflict with their cousins...  The hostility between the two 
species in "modern" Tekumel are not necessarily because of this conflict.  
Cultural ideologies among the Ssu (and humans) could easily provide 
incentive for genocidal warfare.)
Tinaliya (look at 'em.  Little bitty Ssu, but a friendlier variety).
Shunned Ones (adapted for a hostile environment different from that 
currently found on Tekumel)

Beings Descended from Quadrupedal Terrestrial Organisms:
Shen (they may well be from Rigel or wherever, but by way of Earth first)
Pygmy Folk
Pachei Lei (probably "artificial" life forms.  Otherwise, they seem a 
little too closely related to the Ahoggya.)
Ahoggya (quadruplets joined at the back and further modified for some 
reason now long forgotten)
Urunen
Renyu (I thought they were baboons of some sort until acquiring books 
other than the novels - remember the legends of "dog-headed" people from 
explorers in the Middle Ages here on earth?  I left them as baboons...)

Beings Descended from Hexapodal Terrestrial Vertebrates:
Hlyss (probably engineered for warfare in the distant past)
Hlaka (two limbs now wings; note that they also have stinger and three 
eyes like Hlyss)
Churstalli
Lri (flying Hlyss)
Shanu'ur (big Hlaka)
Dzor (two limbs lost, secondarily modified into humanoid form)
Pei Choi (lost one eye)
etc.

This does not mean that all of these beings are now capable of fully
understanding each other.  Different types of animals have different
motivations and responses.  Millennia of independent development added to
this results in the cultural differences seen in the game.

I have always allowed at least partial communication with friendly non-
humans in my campaigns.  There are "pidgin" languages combining compatible 
sounds, gestures, symbols, etc. for each of the friendly races.  Shen lack 
mobile lips to mimic human "words" as do the Pei Choi and Pygmy Folk.  
Conversely, humans lack the ability to easily mimic the sounds of these 
beings.  Cultural misunderstandings still abound.  Most characters quickly 
learn to steer clear of non-humans unless absolutely necessary - who knows 
how a hoard of 3' tall beaked bipedal rats with highly aggressive behaviors 
(and consequently incredibly violent culture) will react to a plea for aid 
or an offer of exchange of some sort? And the Pygmy Folk are mammals. 
Reptilian/Dinosaurian Shen are pretty much incomprehensible except for the
basics (fight or flight, getting food, defending territory, etc.).

You get the picture.

We do have pigs and rats on our Tekumel (along with elephants, llamas, 
lions, kangaroos, and a few others if you know where to look).

Related topic:  other interesting aliens for Tekumel from other game
systems--
1.  Shanthas (Skyrealms of Jorune)
2.  Eber (2300 AD)
3.  Virushi (the original Traveller, one of the JTAS issues)
4.  Thriddle (also Jorune)

Feedback is always welcome.  And if anyone is interested in swapping 
campaign info., character descriptions, etc., feel free to drop me a 
line.

Dale Robertson (biologist, artist, bagpiper, and general lay-about)

P.S.  Can we expect to see a Tsolyani grammar web book in the future?

[                   items I don't have, but the Professor is working on it.  ]

>What is known of the areas/nations of Tane and Naqsai?  Nations?  Languages?

I just checked. The Tane article is in "Dispatches in [sic! -- to?] the 
Imperium".  It has a nice map of Tane and a dispatch from Bill Hoyt's 
character. This issue also contains the article on the temple of Ksarul, 
plus short pieces on the Churstalli and other matters. 

Tane has never been explored or exploited very much. Might be fun to do.

As for the Naqsai, they have never been written up in any detail. Mentions 
of them appear here and there, but somebody needs to go down there and 
really learn their languages, cultures, etc. They comprise a dozen 
related city-states, tribes, etc. on the northern shore of the Southern 
Continent just southwest of Livyanu. There is a city there devoted to 
the Goddess (Who Cannot be Named), and several Hokun settlements farther 
southwest along the coast. Lots to be discovered...

[Moderator's Note:  The professor responds to Dale's theories.               ]

Thanks to Dale Robertson for his insights. I am curious as to why his 
fauna have to be modified or mutated Terran creatures, rather than 
actually from other worlds. There is no compelling reason to insist one 
way or the other: one can have "non-terrestrial" creatures or one can 
have modfified terrestrial creatures. It all as an author wants to 
imagine it. I chose to have my critters non-terrestrial in origin. 
After all if our universe is made up of the same elements, and life 
forms must be based on carbon (or silicon?), and if ecology and 
biological processes work in the same general way on Arcturus or 
Aldebaran as they do here, then ... why not?

In any case, Dale is welcome to his version of Tekumel. There are 
rats and mice, as well as non-terrestrial creatures that keep the 
rodent population down. There are no pigs -- plague wiped them out 
long ago when humankind was still exploring the stars. I think it 
began on one of the Shen worlds and then spread back to earth and 
elsewhere.  I have never encountered any of the other terrestrial 
creatures Dale mentions: llamas, etc. I can't bring myself to 
imagine a Tekumelani kangeroo...!

Dale is absolutely correct about the role of genetic engineering, 
however. THere has been a lot of that, and it has produced both 
beauty and sheer horror.

I won't comment on the details of Dale's forumlations except to 
note that I am interested -- and grateful -- that he has taken so 
much time and energy to create them. They differ from mine, but ... 
As my father used to say, "It's a difference of opinion that makes 
horse-racing."

Phil

Accepting of course that this is YOUR Tekumel (and I have no problem
with that), I am drawn to wonder WHY.  The situation you describe is
rather more complicated than is necessary to explain the circumstances,
in other words it violates the test of Occam's Razor.  Yes, it COULD be
the case that the Shen are drastically-genetically-engineered humans, as
are the creatures which came from their worlds.  But it seems a lot
simpler if they're just a separately-evolved set of life forms.  Or do
you consider it unlikely that life evolved on any planet but Terra?

This is precisely what I'm talking about.  I mean, maybe the idea of
life evolving on another planet stretches someone's plausibility.  But
doesn't the above scenario, "Humanity begat Ssu, and Ssu begat
Tinaliya," stretch plausibility even farther?

These folks are in fact descended from Humanity, with the exception of
the genus "Talk Show Host" which are actually a form of  nonhuman
He'esa.

Sorry, you lose me right there.  I can accept the idea that someday a

evolve into Talk Show Host or Heheganu... but Ahoggya?!  Never!  My DNA
would strangle itself with its own  genomes first...

Well, I can only assume that your vocation leads you to this somewhat
overcomplicated view of Tekumel:  does this alternate genesis play a
role in your games?  Are zoological/biological themes important to your
campaigns?  Otherwise, this would seem like a lot of effort to go to in
order to avoid any non-Terrrestrial origins for Tekumel's inhabitants.
On the other hand, it may help explain why Pe Choi taste so good boiled,
with a little lemon butter...

The answer to that one is rather straight forward:  I believe that if 
life exists on other worlds, billions of years of independent evolution 
will shape it into forms completely unfamiliar to us.  The larger 
Tekumelani animals look to me like vertebrates, mammals, dinosaurs, 
etc.  The odds of aliens being so close to use chemically, physically, 
behaviorally, etc. - well, it just cannot happen (at least that's how 
I see it - there is a definate shortage of extraterrestrials against 
which to test my theory!). As a result, I chose to describe the fauna of 
Tekumel as I see it - and it fits together quite nicely.  At any rate, 
only one player (a botanist) ever expressed any curiosity about the 
relationships of Tekumelani critters.  Either way works equally well.

Try imagining a Tekumelani kangaroo with a Niniyal riding in the pouch 
taking aim at a helpless play[er] with a tiny crossbow...

As a side note, one enterprising character attempted to introduce the 
llamas to the Tsolyani.  Even if the cultures are not inclined to 
inovation, player characters are the exceptions, so I pretty much let 
them do or think whatever they wish.  At any rate, the introduction of 
the llamas led to a brief interlude we affectionately term "The 
Merchants' War".  It was primarily a sharp quick feud between several 
clans of chlen breeders, chlen cartwrights (Hossmu?  Little Joemu?), 
various chlen affectionados, etc. and the clan of the character who 
brought the llamas.  The result?  The jury is still out, but the llamas 
are in the zoo and the character decided to move out to Kilalamu where 
he found the blasted critters in the first place!

Biology is not my specialty, and second-guessing someone is always
suspect, but herewith follows my 2 Quirgals worth...

They're too similar. With the possible exception of the Ssu and their
food, the Shunned ones and Mihalli, all major races are compatible at a
very basic level. Such forms as hair, skin, bones almost certainly imply
DNA, and the same type of DNA that such close cousins as Spiders,
Streptococcus Bacteria and Horses share. This means that it strains
credulity for them to have originated so widely.

Had they not been compatible, not only would they all have different
food requirements, VERY different (levro- vs dextro- sugars for example)
but the allergy problems would mean that "this planet ain't big enough
for the both of us, pardner". Again, the Ssu and Shunned Ones are both
exceptions.

But....
If the Hoyle-Wickramasinghe hypothesis is correct, then it may be that
all stars in the local area - 61 Cygni, Sigma Draconis, 70 Ophiuchi to
name a few of the more likely ones - are certainly contaminated with
each other's lifestuff. In which case the strongest would survive in
environment, and all advanced life would have adjusted to some degree to
the older or more foreign strains. The H-W Hypothesis states that, for
example, virusses are constantly bombarding us. We adjust to them, or we
die. Similarly, we have also adjusted (poorly) to Clostridium Botulinum
and other such anaerobes, which are quite different from us (but
probably similar to the Shunned Ones).

That's why a professional biologist chokes at the idea of multiple
origins, while I, a mere ameteur, find it not unreasonable.

[Moderator's Note:  David Cheng sends an update on the Tekumel Con.         ]

Tekumel-Con plans are still rolling along.  I have made significant
progress in the past couple of weeks.  I want to give you all a little
update.

I have collected mailing lists from the following sources:
1)  Theatre of the Mind Enterprises
2)  PhD Games
3)  Andrew Lorince
4)  James Roach's _Realms of Wonder_
5)  Foster & Morris' _Eye of All-Seeing Wonder_
6)  people who have contacted me directly.

... and built a database with records from all six sources.  This gave us
about 830 names.

After deleting obvious duplicates, we're down to about 670 names.

I am pretty close to having a package of material to send out in a mass
mailing.  It will contain:
*  Cover letter from yours truly
*  Tekumel-Con promotional flyer
*  +Pre-Paid+ Questionnaire postcard
*  Miscellaneous Tekumel Info Sheet.

That's everything I can think of - suggestions for items I'm overlooking
are appreciated.  Please send suggestions directly to me <cheng@io.com>,

On the contrary, I think the universe is probably full of life - just 
not life that looks like human beings in funny masks (or lizards that 
look like humans in the case of Shen).  For extraterrestrial life forms 
to evolve into humanoid forms is so unlikely as to proclude its ever 
happening - at least that's how it looks (other than related primates, 
how many other Earth creatures are humanoid?  None!).   

Think of it like this - you are studying the language of a people in 
another corner of the world.  You discover that their word for the 
shining metal boxes that fly is "airplane."  Which is more likely, 
that the word developed independently, or came from somewhere else?  
This is Ocham's razor.

Not at all.  Humanoid features (two eyes, limbs, roughly the same mass,
ability to use and understand one anothers devices) suggest that the 
Ssu are human in origin.

Nope.  Just the opposite - I'm jist a poor ole scientist out here trying 
to put some order into the chaos of Tekumelyani zoology.  If one believes 
that evolution always favors humanoid forms, mass and technologies, then 
this is fine.  Ultimately, neither hypothesis is testable at this time, 
Martian meteorites not included!

The question of Tekumelyani biology has only came up once - but that 
player was a plant geneticist.  We tend to concentrate on heroic action, 
saving the day, etc.  I'll have to try Pe Choi with lemon butter.  
Eating them with katchup is too nakome even for us!

I have no problems with multiple origins - I just have a problem with

As I'm sitting here at work, the question comes to mind; what are the
Other-Planar/magical properties of the Chima?  According to the treatise 
on the Sunuz language, the Chima were attributed to with Other-Planar 
abilities similar (?!) to the Mihalli.  This is a very intriguing remark, 
considering the Tekumel Beastiary in no way mentions these abilities of 
the Chima (or are the statements made in the Sunuz study all an insiduous 
tricks by the agents of the Pariah Deities?)  Can anyone bring to light 
more information (details please) of this (at least to me) mysterious 
species?

There are no football, soccer, basketball, or badminton leagues, as far 
as I know. In the Zocchi Sourcebook, p. 99, a game called Marotlan is 
described. in Yan Kor and the north and west they call this game Me'era, 
and a large leather ball is employed. Teams must try to keep it out of 
their "colour" areas.

The feasts of the nobility often include acrobatic displays, gladiatorial 
contests (usually not to the death), wrestling, and other combative but 
non-fatal games. These are not really "public" but are limited to the 
audiences invited by the host.

If you can get a copy of the Zocchi Sourcebook, a few of these recreations 
are sketched in. It would take a great deal of work to provide rules for 
them all -- and the Five Empires differ widely over what those rules are!

Music is touched on on p. 97 of the Zocchi Sourcebook. I hope the third 
volume of this (the part that includes entertainments, etc.) will be up 
on the FTP site soon -- and perhaps someone could xerox pages for you in 
the meantime!

The only music I have from Tekumel is a single tape recording, which 
contains a temple ritual from the temple of Ksarul, another from a 
Sarku ceremony, and a brief chorus from the Lament to the Wheel of 
Black. None of these is "good music," and there are no recordings of 
"lighter" music or folk-music, which the Five Empires have aplenty. 
Plenty of scope here for somebody!

Courtship is carried out as it has been among humans from time immemorial: 
meetings, trysts, "dates" (mostly within one's own clanhouse circles and 
families), plus excursions to such places as 'The House of the Pleasant 
Hour" in Jakalla. Parents may provide their pubescent sons with concubines 
-- and a bag of Lisutl root to keep away unwanted offspring! Girls are 
strenuously admonished to marry well, but there is not much stress on 
"viriginity" or "chastity." The temple dormitories are in some cases 
coeducational... As for street displays of affection, go right ahead: 
nobody but a Ghatoni would object! (It is also said that the Ahoggya feel 
disgust upon observing human sexual congress, but then they feel disgust 
at many human preoccupations -- and vice-versa.) 

Marriages are often the result of family pressures, as they are here in 
more traditional societies, and young folk are often dragooned into 
marrying a "good match" that will help the family's prestige and wealth. 
Aridani girls don't have to marry the person selected for them, of course, 
and even a "good clan girl" can kick up her heels and balk now and then. 
If either boy or girl is not satisfied with his/her marriage partner, a 
second marriage can be contracted with equals (or even a person from a 
superior clan -- a love match). There are also concubines, who are really 
rather close to being servants or slaves. Again, love matches occur -- a 
famous case is that of Lady Mnella of Jakalla, who started out as rather 
a lowly clangirl and kept marrying "up" until she became rich and 
prestigious, as she is today. The Tsolyani attitude toward this is: good 
for her, as long as she does not pretend (ignoble action) to be someone 
or something she is not! 

These mores are very complex, especially when second, third, etc. 
marriages are considered. Legal contracts must be written to cover how 
much property the spouses will spend together, who gets what property, 
what clans and lineages any children will belong to, who inherits, and
so on...

This will be too brief to help much, but I'd have to write a disser-
tation on it!

Regards,

Phil

The third novel is now being rewritten -- again! It is complex and

As for the fourth, fifth, etc., these were originally just plans -- not 
real outlines -- and I think I may have bitten off more than I could 
chew. Ah, I was young in those halcyon days of yore!

As for the character sheets, I am sure there are some floating around 
out there that could be xeroxed.

If someone has a bad one, I could use it for a guideline for doing it up in
ClarisDraw, since I can then print it out to Adobe Acrobat.  I assume you
were talking about scanning it, since you said a good one.  I like doing
forms, and ClarisDraw makes it easy.

[Moderator's Note:  Adam Crossingham asks for earthly equivalents to       ]
[                   Tekumelani music.  I sent this to the list as a whole, ]
[                   to hear everybody's opinion on the subject.  Although, ]
[                   I expect to hear from the Professor, too.              ]

For my maiden question, I was going to ask what music sounded like on 
Tekumel, but Dale Robertson asked about, and Prof. Barker touched upon 
Tsolyani music in "Message 400: Tsolyani Society". Rats, beaten to the 
punch....

However I would like to develop Dale's question about what 
Tsolyani/Tekumelian music actually sounds like, and ask if there any 
traditions of music on Earth today (or perhaps a musical sound that 
has been reconstructed, like that of European early medieval music) 
that roughly approximate something from Tekumel?

I was thinking that, for example, perhaps Sri Lankan music, or 
Thailand music, or that awful one-stringed thing from Japan could 
sound similar to something Tekumelian. Then I could go out and locate 
something in the World music section of my record shop to play at a 
game (perhaps while eating food from the banquet menu that was on the 
back cover of a recent "Eye of All-Seeing Wonder" issue), for added 
game *flavour*. Just a thought.

>Here are a few questions on Ghatoni & the Nlu'arshan languages and
>a tidbit from my own explorations for his consideration.

>Regarding the Ghatoni language-what are the 7 consonants 
>and 3 vowels  that require additional symbols in the 
>Yan Koryani script? Im guessing that at least  three of 
>the consonants might be voiced uvular stop & voiced/
>voiceless uvular fricatives (distinct from velar fricatives)?

Ghatoni is a Khishan language, though far removed from Tsolyani, Mu'uga-
lavyani, or even Yan Koryani.  It has no script of its own but is occas-
ionally written in the Yan Koryani script. The seven consonants include 
two pharyngeal fricatives (the voiced "ayn" and voiceless pharyngeal "h" 
of Arabic), and five glottalised stops (p', t' ch' k', q'). "House," 
which is /veshu-(kh)/ in Tsolyani, is /p'izhom/ in Ghatoni -- the "o" is 
a back unrounded central vowel. The other two vowels are a phonemic 
"schwa" (the first "a" of "above"), and a high back unrounded vowel. 
Neither the back unrounded "o" nor the ":u" occur in English or any 
European language. Turkish does have the "undotted i" that represents a 
back unrounded vowel, but only Mongolian (e.g. the Khalkha dialect) has 
very high and mid back unrounded vowels that sound much like Ghatoni.

>Does Ghatoni make a distinction between front rounded 
>and back unrounded vowels? (which would add at least two 
>vowels...)

Yes, as above.

>The description of glottalized stops vs 
>voiceless  vs aspirated stops in Ghatoni was very 
>enlightening, I gather that a corresponding situation 
>holds for the various Nluss dialects?

Yes. The N'lu'arsh languages seem to have influenced Pijenani and were 
probably the source for the glottalised stops in archaic Mu'ugalavyani. 
Most Mu'ugalavyani today write glottalised stops only in such "traditional 
spellings" as Ch'ochi. Nobody pronounces them, except pedants and 
occasional N'luss speakers who learn Mu'ugalavyani.
 
>Do Ghatoni and the Nluarshan languages also possess 
>voiceless nasals and /r/--/hm, hn, hr/, etc.?

Yes. Voiceless nasals and laterals (/hm, hn, hw, hl/) are common in 
N'lu'arshan tongues, as in Khishan. There are even supposed to be 
contrasts between a voiceless lateral (/hl/) and a strongly fricativ-
ised voiceless lateral (the "barred l" of Welsh "Llewellyn").

>From what 
>few examples I have seen, I take it that Nluarshan 
>languages also possess a syllabic /r/ as in the names 
>/Mrrgsha/ and /Grdra/. Similarly, is there a syllabic /r/ 
>in the Ghatoni words /petr, betr, petr/--or are the latter 
>retroflex stops?

There is indeed a syllabic /r/ in N'lu'arshan, as also -- very rarely -- 
in old Mu'ugalavyani (and still preserved in the name of the chief deity 
there: /hrsh/). The quality of this "r" is rather like the vowel nucleus 
of midwestern American English "bird," "curd," "verb," etc. 

>Do the retroflex nasal & lateral of Yan 
>Kor occur in any of the surrounding languages (Ghatoni, 
>Pjjenaa, Loorunankh)?

I suspect these phonemes are found in some of the Lo'orunankh dialects, 
but I don't recall them in Pijenani.
 
>The classical form of Muugalavyani, or rather the 
>Engsvanyali dialect that became Muugalavyani, possessed 
>a series of aspirated and glottalized stops: p, t, 
>ch, k, q & ph, th, chh, kh, qh. I know that modern

>in modern Muugalavyani dialects? (I am guessing that

>would be most likely to maintain them).

You are right. Older forms of Mu'ugalavyani did indeed have glottalised 
stops, and it is possible that dialects on the N'luss frontier would 
still have them.  Modern Mu'ugalavyani consider these sounds to be 
"barbaric" or "archaic affectations."

The Chima are hard to study. They tend to be aloof and resistant to 
contact.  They aren't hostile, but somehow questioners seem to always 
get bland, meaningless answers whenever they probe too deeply.  Talk 
about fish, ropes, sails, the sea, etc., and the Chima are a mine of 
information.  Try to dig into other-planar stuff, and suddenly it's 
"Oh, look at the bird!  He flies so high above our heads!"  Nothing but 
platitudes and chitchat.

On the other hand, the Chima do seem able to shift planes.  Not as easily 
as the Mihalli, and certainly not with the understanding of Other-Planar 
power and "magic" possessed by the M ihalli (and some few human 
sorcerers).  But even a simple Chima fisherman may occasionally be met 
with on the Rivers That Flow Between the Worlds...

You're welcome to devise whatever you wish for Tekumel -- as a 
*contribution* that may or may not be "real" Tekumel.  I shall 
look and see if the place also exists on "my" Tekumel.  It is 
entirely possible that it may... As for "clicks" (like Xhosa here 
on Terra), I'd just as soon not encounter them! We spent a long 
spring seminar once when I was learning field linguistics learning 
to produce clicks, and I was never very good at it!  We also 
tried Fanti, but the word-tones were too intricate for my poor 
unsophisticated ears!  That's why I have strenuously resisted 
learning more of the Aom tongues!

[Moderator's Note:  This is just a status message and one reporting to you  ]
[                   some first hand events of my visit to Minneapolis, and  ]
[                   what I saw transpire on Tekumel.                        ]

I won't go into too much detail on my arrival into Kashkomai valley, but it 
was less dignified than I had intended.  Let's just say that I would have 
been toast if it weren't for unlooked for help from an unusual source.  I 
believe the entry in the campaign diary was, "Naked Preist of Ksarul arrives
with a Mnor riding on his shoulder."  No more need be said!

Once at the valley, I had to make way to see the holder of the fief, as I
was supposed to oversee refurbishing the local temple.  Much easier said 
than done, and as the Salarvyani had relieved me of all cash (amongst other
things), I had nothing with which to grease the wheels.  Judicious use of 
magic provided the open door I needed, and I was off to see the lady of the 
tower. Well, I found out that there was no temple there any more.  It, with
most of the other buildings in the valley were wiped out by Salarvyani 
raiding parties.  Ah, what to do.  Well, I began scouting the area for 
possible worshippers.  I continue to do so, and have learned some very 
interesting things.   I also acquired a "temple" (converted house) to begin 
the building process (thanks to a local priest of Wuru).  

There is too much war, raiding parties,and other nastiness going on outside 
the valley to want to go back, and too much cool stuff to investigate within 
the valley for me to leave, currently.

Also, one of the adventures of some of the players took them to a huge 
battle site between Eselne and his troops, and Rereshqala's troops.  At
one point, Eselne seems to have died, but I'm sorry to say he didn't stay
that way.  I think that our party saved him, but we can't really be sure.
It appears that Eselne is trying to overrun Rereshqala, and get him totally
out of the picture.  Then he'll try to deal with Taksuru/Mirusiya.  This
battle apparently took place just south of Usenanu, on the Missuma River.

It would be cool if the regular players on the list would give us some more
detail when they find out more.  I know you guys are busy, but a nugget or
two of news would be quite welcome.

I had a great time and can't wait to go back again, and for the Tekumel con.

Early mediaeval, Japanese, Indonesian gamelan, Arabic, and Hollywood 
S-and-and-sorcery movies (e.g. "Sinbad," "The THief of Baghdad," etc.) 
have all been suggested. There are counterparts to some of these. 
Tsolyani folk music sounds "bouncy" with a good rhythm and a relatively 
happy tone; epic poetry is ponderous, slow, and full of long, quavering 
notes that are allowed to die away; temple music is appropriately 
powerful, somewhat overwhelming, and -- in some cases -- awe-inspiring. 
The melodies do not sound like much that we in modern Europe/America 
are familiar with. I played a Ksarul temple chant, a melodic (flute-
drum-vocal) interlude to the Lament to the Wheel of Black, and a portion 
of a longish temple ceremony/chant/descent into the Underworld for our 
esteemed moderator when he was just up here, and I don't think he was 
all that impressed.

[Moderator's Note:  At the time this was going on, we were either perusing   ]
[                   some very interesting stuff, or working on the computer, ]

No problem -- to each his own. There are numerous traditions, just as 
there are here: Yan Koryani music gives a feeling of roughness, power, 
raw and unsophisticated rhythms; Livyani music is delicate, involuted, 
and complex, using several interlocking melody-rhyme-metre lines. And 
so on.

There are more similarities to Thai and Sri Lankan music than to Mozart, 
Brahms, the Beatles, Rap, or Heavy Metal. But having said that... where 
from here?

Long, slow, contemplative Indian sitar music may have something in 
common with the Tenturen (the instrument used for Tsolyani classical 
music). Try to find a performance of Raga Malkos -- the scale is 
similar. Flute and the little bowls filled with water (called 
"Jaltarang" in India) are also likely to produce some similarities.

Take note: I am absolutely no expert on musical matters (As if people 
couldn't guess from what I am saying here!)

Spared!  Absolutely!  The great palaces and architectural marvels would be 
preserved, but the city -- houses, slums, government buildings of no great 
interest, etc. etc. -- would be torn down all around it.

Ditlana has to be done carefully, with lots of planning and work.  A truly 
bad Ditlana could wreck a beautiful building by making it unstable -- as 
happened some centuries ago at Katalal.  The temple of Vimuhla there had 
to be rebuilt after the local governor made its foundations undependable.
Cost him his job, but his clan saved him from worse.

You're doing fine.  It is written that Lord Qon sends his servitors to 
the deceased, and after some of what you have described above, these 
servitors lead the spirit to a waiting boat "on the Shores of the Sea 
That Never Was," and they set sail for the Isles of Teretane.  Aout this 
time one's memories of life begin to fade, and the journey becomes the 
All.  Spirits speak to one another and sit at neighbouring oars, but there 
is little or no memory of what is said.  (Ask anyone how much he remembers 
of the time before his spirit was placed in his mother's womb before his 
birth.)  The journey through the Isles takes either seconds or millennia, 
according to Lord Belkhanu's theologians.  Some believe that spirits are 
then reborn in new bodies.  Read the little section in the Book of Ebon 
Bindings.

Interestingly enough, Belkhanu's clergy are almost always employed to 
bury the dead, except for those of the temples of Sarku-Durritlamish 
(who bury their own) and Vimuhla-Chiteng (who burn their dead). 
Belkhanu is acceptable, thus, even for Ksarul and Hru'u, although those 
who are truly devout and/or members of these temples' priesthoods may 
indeed have separate ceremonies that focus on the rites of their own 
sects.  In Mu'ugalavya, most dead are burned in ceremonies put on by the 
priests of Hrsh; in Livyanu, there is no consensus, and the temples of
the Shadow Gods permit no outsiders to enter their temples' mausoleums 
or cemeteries (except under very unusual circumstances).  The Yan Koryani 
operate much like the Tsolyani, and the Salarvyani tend to leave burial 
customs to the deceased's family or lineage.  The temple of Shiringgayi 
is thus called upon only by those who really worship her, while most of 
the great lineages (e.g. the Thirreqummu of Koyluga) have cemeteries 
and customs of their own.  In most lands there are noisome corpse pits 
for the poor and unimportant, cemeteries and tombstones for those of 
middling importance, and great monuments for those of the highest ranks.

It is hard to be more specific.  There are too many variables -- customs 
that change over space and time.  Your relation of the life after death 
could conceivably end with the deceased being reborn in a new "incarnation."

Yan Kor in the days of the Engsvanyali was a ring of northern islands and 
a central shallow sea, where the Desert of Sighs and some of the northern 
plains are today.  It was a province of the Priestkings' empire.  After 
the fall of Engsvan hla Ganga, the "province" of Yan Kor was sometimes 
independent and sometimes a part of the expanding Tsolyani Imperium.  The 
Tsolyani warred and raided up there repeatedly, until Ald came along and 
solidified the city-states into one shaky nation.  Before Ald, Yan Kor was 
considered by the Tsolyani to be "their property" on the basis of its 
Engsvanyali status.  It was an "Empire" in name only during some of that 
time, but at others, it was autonomous.  Now it is classified by Tekumelani 
historians as an "Empire."

The other planets of the system are visible to the naked eye. There is 
no difference between a "star" and a "planet" as far as the Tekumelani 
are concerned.  The fact that stars twinkle and planets do not is irrel-
evant if one has no stars to compare the planets with.  There are a few 
telescopes on Tekumel, left over from the age of the Great Ancients, but 
the average astronomer must just go on eye-measurements, the way the 
ancient Maya did it.  The astrological system, as I have said before, is 
based upon the horizon (the rising and setting points of each planet), 
plus "aspects" made between the celestial bodies (the four planets, the 
two moons, and the sun).  A few of the ancient orbiting satellites are 
still visible as well.  The "aspects" include conjunctions, squares, 
trines, and oppositions.  With no constellations, the quadrants of the 
sky (the "houses") are important.  Somebody with more astronomical 
know-how than I have could make up a decent guide, but this is a bit 
beyond my capabilities.

The peasants and lower classes use divination methods based on patterns 
of sticks thrown into a box of sand, on stones thrown onto a mat painted 
with various patterns, etc.  The sticks are similar in form to those used 
for tsahlten, but they are different.  The temples discourage these "folk" 
methods of divination.  They have complex rituals and methods that are 
probably just as reliable -- or unreliable.  Only those with a lot of 
knowledge, money, and talent can expect better results, using magic and 
spells based upon Other-Planar power.

The Tsoggu looks (and smells!) enough like a drowned corpse to make people 
think it is one. It is mottled tan in colour, roughly human-sized, and has 
discoloured areas that seem to be eyes, a mouth, and bifurcations between 
its limbs. It has pupilless, white eyesa that have a hypnotic power. If it 
succeeds in capturing a fish, a humn, or other prey, it lets them drown and 
then eats their bodies when they have become "ripe" enough. It has claws on 
both hands and feet, but these limbs are not its main fighting weapons. 
Sailors believe it has a terrible set of fangs, but this is unclear since 
specimens are very rare. It may have just enough of a set of fangs to tear 
and rend carrion after it has hypnotised and drowned its prey.

The wings are shaped rather like those of a bat, but they actually are very 
thin and membraneous, as stated. The wings are larger than those in the 
picture, of course.

I can't think of anything that isn't already illustrated.

The Bestiary is correct. The head is perhaps a little less like a serpent 
and more like a viper, but it's hard for human artists who have never seen 
one to do much better. The tentacles and webbed feet are correct. Some have 
reported human-like hands, but this variant either does not exist or else 
is quite rare. Remember that these construct-creatures are not naturally 
reproducing species that always come in one and the same form. Variations 
are common enough and may represent different origins, different "mixes" 
of the biological soup from which these beings were created, or different 
types for different purposes.

Good luck! I look forward to seeing these kindly characters in 3-dimensional 
form!

Adlar and Achan's Excellent Adventure
     -or-
Thursday the Ksarul Priest went Naked

It was an ordinary autumn day in the Valley of Kashkomai.  In the
fields, the peasants were harvesting the Dna grain, carefully picking
out Mnor webbing and redolent scraps of Ssu-flesh dropped the prior
evening.  Epeng the size of basketballs scurried through the underbrush
near the temple of Wuru, dodging the Dzor who was snoring against a
tree. Within the tower at the east end of the valley, Adlar hiFershena
was enjoying anew the ability to stand up while relieving himself.  "If
I ever find that Mihalli who turned me into a female," he growled, "I'll
turn HIM into a pair of half-Mihalli..."

Emerging from the facilities he nearly bumped into Drakohl, the grizzled
Vimuhla veteran who served Lady Metlana as the captain of the tower
guard. "Everything come out all right?" Drakohl snorted.

"Yeah, thanks to you.  Boy I hated being female." Adlar replied.  "If
you hadn't had that disenchantment stone, I'd still be wearing a skirt!"

Drakohl paused.  "You ARE wearing a skirt," he said.

Adlar stopped, looking down. "No I'm not, that's a kilt."

"What's the difference?"

"What do you mean, 'what's the difference'?" Adlar responded
indignantly.  "A skirt is a skirt, and a kilt is a kilt."

"Adlar," Drakohl drawled, "that's the same thing you were wearing
yesterday when you were female."

"Maybe," Adlar replied slowly, "but I'm wearing it AS a kilt.  That's
the difference."

Drakohl did not reply, but turned and walked up the stairs to Lady
Metlana's audience hall, shaking his head slowly.

Adlar's reply was lost as a hand touched his forearm.  He turned to see
a tall, dour figure looming over him.  "Excuse me," he said, "I'm
looking for the lady."

"Upstairs," Adlar replied automatically.  As the figure passed, he tried
to recall where he'd seen the fellow before.  Somewhere, sometime...
that was it!  That was Thuken, the Undying Wizard!  He'd killed Adlar
three or four times during his attempted takeover of Kashkomai Valley,
and only the generous application of revivification spells by the
Undying Wizard Torshanmu had kept Adlar in the fight.

Adlar was considering whether he should pursue Thuken when the Wizard
reappeared, in the company of Lord Drakohl and the Lady herself.  Ah
Metlana!  Adlar had eyes only for her.  They had been lovers for weeks
now, ever since returning to Kashkomai and ousting the usurper, Sanjesh.
 During his time as a female Adlar had hope to explore certain
possibilities, but alas the opportunity had not presented itself.  Now
restored, his heart fluttered as she walked up, gazed lovingly into
Adlar's eyes and said, "The basement."

"What?" Adlar asked, snapping out of his reverie.

"We're going down the basement.  Please attend me," the Lady snapped.

No command could be more lovingly given, nor more ardently followed.
Concealing his passion behind the stony visage of a Karakan warrior,
Adlar prepared to strike down the deadly Thuken should he once again
threaten Lady Metlana as he did when contesting for control of the
valley.

For once the dread basement of the tower was quiet.  No invisible demons
pounded at the iron plate covering the hole leading into the pit.  No
planar rifts opened into the squamous plane of Horodai.  The corpses of
the Vimuhla priests had long been removed.  Thuken led the small group
quickly into the storeroom full of rusted and broken devices of the
Ancients.  He gestured abruptly, and the wall at the back of the
storeroom opened.

"I knew there was a secret room back there!" exclaimed Adlar.  Thuken,
Metlana and Drakohl issued a chorus of shushes, and the three stepped
into the room.

Tiny golden, green and red lights blinked upon various waist-high
facades around the walls.  A wire-frame chair, its padding rotted to a
pile of dust on the floor, occupied a central spot.  The mighty Undying
Wizard Thuken surveyed the magical panels and muttered, "Yes, this
should do.  I should be able to take over the valley  from right here."

Lady Metlana's eyes widened (beautifully, Adlar thought) and Lord
Drakohl sputtered, "What?  But you said..."

Thuken turned a condescending gaze upon the trio, "Yes, well that was
before, wasn't it?  And really, there's little you can do.  You have
nothing with which to oppose me, and neither meddlesome Thomar or that
idiot Torshanmu are here to help you this time.  But look," he drawled,
"I'm a kind man.  Depart now, and I'll leave your skeins on the loom for
a while.  Or join me, and share in the power of the Goddess!  She is
quite generous.  But oppose me, and I'll make you wish you never
existed.  Actually, I'll probably just make it so that you never did
exist."

He glared levelly at the three for a moment, then turned his back with a
scornful snort and began clicking switches on the panels around him.
Adlar, farthest from Thuken in the tiny room, could not get past Drakohl
or Metlana.  If he had, he would certainly have cleft the Undying Wizard
in two with his mighty sword!  As it was, he was in a perfect position
to see Lord Drakohl reach into the pocket of his skirt, er, kilt, and
remove an ordinary-looking black lump of stone.  The disenchantment
stone!  From somewhere, he was unclear as to just where, Lord Drakohl
had procured a stone bearing three spells of Disenchantment.  One had
been used on Adlar himself, to reverse the foul Mihalli spell that had
turned the proud Karakan warrior into a helpless female slave.  Now
Drakohl was turning the stone upon the Undying Wizard!

At the last instant, Thuken seemed to sense something, and started to
whirl around.  Certainly a simple disenchantment amulet could hardly
have any effect upon a mighty Undying Wizard!  But Drakohl's move must
have taken Thuken by surprise:  the spell caught him full on, and the
Wizard registered a look of shock before seeming to flatten, to waver,
and finally to flash off in an unexpected, indescribable direction to
nowhere.  The spells which had brought the Undying Wizard to the Valley
must have failed, and Thuken had been flung back to where he came from!

"Well done!" cried Lady Metlana, throwing her arms in a disturbingly
affectionate manner about Lord Drakohl's brawny shoulders. "That was
terribly risky, what if it hadn't worked?"

Lord Drakohl's iron visage registered little as he said, "Frankly, I'm
surprised it did.  But he'll be back, with a vengeance."

"Good," cried Adlar, "Then I'll have another chance to give him a taste
of my steel!  You dispatched him before I could teach him another
lesson, Lord Drakohl."

"Adlar," said Metlana, "He killed you four times.  You never even got
near him."

"The last time, he split you clean in half," added Drakohl.

"Well," Adlar drawled, "That was before I had this steel sword."

"Look," continued Drakohl, "Thuken could get back here any time.  Get
down to Achan's house and have him get up here with his magic items.
That's the only chance we've got."

"Yes sir!" saluted Adlar.  Before journeying to Kashkomai to seek the
affections of his Lady, Adlar had been a noted Imperial Courier, and now
it was he the Lady turned to for the quick dispatch of messages.

"Meanwhile," growled Drakohl, "Lady Metlana and I have certain, er,
rituals to perform to protect the tower."  Metlana and Drakohl both
worshipped Vimuhla, and often conducted rituals to their mutual God.

"Rituals?" asked Metlana.  Then she seemed to remember, "Oh, yes, right,
the RITUALS..."

"...of protection..." reminded Drakohl.

"...of protection, yes, of course." Metlana agreed eagerly, her eyes
shining.

That was one of the many things Adlar adored about her; her devotion to
her faith.  He hoped that sometime Lord Drakohl and Lady Metlana would
let him observe their rituals, but Lord Drakohl had assured Adlar that
the rituals were secret of the Temple of Vimuhla, and could not be
shared.

Adlar hurried off.  In the service of his Lady, he would not fail.
Donning his running sandals, and carrying his sword for protection, he
dashed off across the valley of Kashkomai to the house of Achan,
guardian of the valley...

Thinking about music fitting Tekumelani temples, I stumbled across the CD 
"How to Destroy Angels" by the british independent band COIL. It amazed 
me so much that I developped a habit of reading the tekumel-novels while 
listening to it and it adds very much to the slightly eerie, very exotic 
atmosphere. The same goes for the CD's "Stolen and Conterminated Songs" 
and "Unnatural History, Vols. I and II" by the same band.
Does anyone in the NG know them, by chance, or is anyone willing to check 
them out so as to let me know of his/hers experience.
I've become quite a Coil fan in the passage of the last years, and I'd 
really like to know other people's opinion on them - regarding their use 
"on Tekumel", that is (I don't want this NG to become a music-critique 
channel... :-)    )

[Moderator's Note:  This is fine for now Ulf.  It is on topic, as long as it]
[                   ends up getting to Tekumel.                             ]

>There are more similarities to Thai and Sri Lankan music than to Mozart,

The same goes IMHO for Coil. (but IMHO, mind that...)

Reading this, I'm getting more and more convinced Coil could do the trick - 
particularly if you listen to their "old" albums (recorded before 1992).
A very curious

[Moderator's Note:  Bob continues the story of the naked Priest, and other ]
[                   misadventures.  This leads up to just before the battle]
[                   we observed between Eselne and Rereshqala.             ]

Adlar hiFershena arrived at the House of the First Founder only slightly
winded.  The twelve-tsan jog from the tower was as nothing compared to
the days-long cross-Empire assignments which he used to run as an
Imperial Courier.  As he rounded the last curve he could not prevent a
chill from running up his spine at the sight of the imposing edifice.

The House of the First Founder, so-called because legend claimed that
this was the  home built by the first human who the Gods placed upon
Tekumel, was not truly "imposing" in appearance.  A simple two-story
stone-and-wood structure, it had a chimney to one side and a small porch
off the front.  But age, legend and reputation shrouded its simple
facade in mystery.  Adlar himself recalled exploring the house only
months before, when he had arrived in the retinue of Lady Metlana.  At
that time the building had been no more than charred rubble over a
basement full of gold and sausages.  Since the house had, well, "healed"
itself.  When Lord Achan, a quiet Ketengku priest, had arrived at the
house he had found it in the pristine and perfectly usable condition
that it maintained today.  The fact that the local peasantry claimed
that the house had "eaten" some of their number in order to restore
itself was certainly no more that the superstitious ramblings of the
poor.

Now the home's two original occupants, Jomu and his little sister Tsa'a,
were playing quietly on the porch, Tsa'a clutching a little doll tightly
to her shoulder with one hand.  They greeted Adlar cheerfully as he
trotted up.

"Is your father home?" Adlar asked.  Upon taking up residence in the
house, Lord Achan had become the foster father to these foundlings.
Adlar wondered if Achan had ever asked the children about the two small
skeletons that Adlar had seen in the upstairs bedroom of the ruined
building, or if Achan had quietly buried them somewhere.

"He is inside, Lord Adlar, I'll fetch him," said Jomu in a most polite
manner.  Adlar was always impressed by these delightful and well-behaved
children.  "FAAAAAAA-
THER!" Jomu cried at the top of his lungs.

"I'm right here, Jomu," said Achan, appearing at the door.  "Greetings
Lord Adlar."

"Greetings, Achan," Adlar said, and quickly explained to Achan the
situation at the tower and the anticipated imminent return of Lord
Thuken.  Achan nodded.

"Let me gather my things and we'll be off," said Achan, with a glance at
the skies, "If we leave now we should be able to make it to the tower
before dark."  One did not wish to wander the valley of Kashkomai at
night.  Raiding bands of Ssu, Salarvyani spies, and naked, sunburned
priests of Ksarul had been known to accost those so foolish as to
venture forth at night.  "Please come inside and refresh yourself while
we prepare for the journey.  Children?"

Everyone entered the house and there was a quick bustle of preparation,
as Lord Achan gave instructions to the two old clan-women who served
him.  "And stay out of the basement." Achan instructed them, as the
party opened the front door and stepped out...

...into the bustling street of a crowded city!

"Jomu, I don't think we're in Kashkomai any more," said Tsa'a, clutching
her dolly.

"Here, you, out of the way!" called an armored Tsolyani soldier, a Kasi
by the looks of him, probably in charge of the cohort marching through
this unknown city.  Adlar looked quickly about:  he had visited most of
the major Tsolyani cities during his time as an Imperial Runner, but all
he could see from his present vantage point were the crowded fronts of
middle-class clanhouses and the dusty passage of the troops.

"Excuse me, good sir," asked Adlar of the Kasi.  "Could you direct us
to..." he groped for an idea, "the Temple of Thumis, sir?"  The Temple
District of most Tsolyani cities displayed unique characteristics of
layout and architecture which Adlar could use for recognition.

"The temple of Thumis?" growled the officer, "Don't you know your way
around Usenanu?  The temple of Thumis is..." he curtly detailed a set of
directions.

Adlar returned to Achan, who had huddled the children in a doorway to
escape the trampling soldiers.  "Follow me," Adlar said, "We'll head to
the temple district.  I ought to be able to recognize where we are from
there."

Following the officer's directions, the four eventually arrived before
the busy gate of the temple of Karakan.  "Close enough," thought Adlar,
and he approached a gate-guard and identified himself as a member of the
Temple.

"You're a Karakan soldier?" asked the guard, "Then why aren't you with
the troops preparing for the battle?"

Eager to avoid being impressed for combat, Adlar quickly replied.   "I
am an Imperial Courier, sir.  These persons," he indicated Achan and the
children, "have been good enough to travel with me from Sokatis.  I have
a message to deliver within the temple."

"Oh, a message do ye?  Well where is it?"  The guard peered suspiciously
at the empty-handed courier.

"It is a verbal message, of great import," claimed Adlar.  He hoped the
guard would not ask for papers, as he bore none.  In truth, the last
time Adlar had visited Sokatis he had found the Offices of the Imperial
Couriers empty, sacked by the troops of Prince Rereshqala or Emperor
Dhich'une as they wrestled for control of the city.  At that time Adlar
had used an official stamp found in the debris to place himself on
indefinite leave of absence (with pay.)  Then, being the ranking (and
only) representative of the Imperial Couriers present, he signed the
papers himself.

"Oh, it's like that, 'tis it?" grinned the guard, "Well, take y'self on
in, I wouldn't want to interfere with Imperial business."  Unusually
helpful, the guard even directed the four to a refectory within the
temple where they could refresh themselves.

[Moderator's Note:  You know, he really does a good written imitation of  ]
[                   Phil in character.  :)                                ]

Making their way into the temple courtyard, the four travellers quickly
made their way to the refectory.  Stepping inside, they found a buffet
fit for an Imperial Prince laid out along one wall.  Meats, fruits, and
delicacies of all sorts were heaped and arranged in a veritable wall of
delights that was much picked-over.   Adlar got the sense that they had
arrived just after a great feast of some sort, for slaves and acolytes
of the temple scurried busily about the daises clearing away the low
tables and eating-mats scattered carefully about.  Nevertheless, there
was no shortage of food for the four of them.  They approached the
buffet, deigning not to wait for a slave to serve them, months of living
on Kashkomai's native dna-gruel having taken their toll.

Before they could reach the buffet, however, a crowd of heavily armored
men appeared at the other side of the refectory, striding quickly.
Glittering in golden armor, one shorter but muscular individual seemed
to be the focus of an intense walking conference.  Around him, proud
warriors leaned in close to listen and to advise, and all strode
hurriedly across the hall towards the exit.

Adlar's mind worked quickly, putting together the clues before him:
troops marching through the city; a great feast prior to their
departure; a man in golden armor in the temple of Karakan;  the rapid
consultation of hurried warriors.  There was only one thing to do:  he
threw himself prostrate upon the floor, Achan quickly following his
lead.

Had Adlar and his comrades simply stood still, the busy group likely
would have marched past without noting them.  Now, however, they were
forced to either acknowledge the tall man on his face before them, or at
least step over him.

"Rise," called Prince Eselne, for surely it was he, "Who are you?"  The
Prince was noted for his disdain of protocol and gruff manner.

Fighting not to stammer, Adlar rose and stated, "Adlar hiFershena,
mighty Prince."  The proper pronouns and honorifics for addressing even
the highest persons were drilled into him during his training as a
Runner.

"Well, well, what of it," barked the Prince, "Have you a message?"

For a moment Adlar wondered if the gate-guard had somehow forewarned the
Prince of his arrival.  Then, staring sheepishly down at his running
sandals Adlar realized that they still bore the stamp and sigil of the
Imperial Runners where the straps crossed over the arch of his foot.
The sharp-eyed Prince had identified him as an Imperial messenger!

"Mighty Prince," he began, by way of grabbing a few moments in which to
think, "I bear a message from..."  his mind whirled "Prince Rereshqala!
In Sokatis!"  Adlar knew that Prince Rereshqala had but recently moved
through the area around Sokatis with his army.  Prince Eselne held the
western portion of the Empire, far enough away for confirmation of
Adlar's message to be difficult.

His words caused the Prince to grunt with surprise.  "Rereshqala, that
dog!?  What could he possibly have to say to me now?"

"Mighty Prince," continued Adlar, "Prince Rereshqala seeks an...
alliance, a truce and a union of forces, to move against certain forces
in the north."  Truly, Adlar had long thought just such an alliance
should occur, to counter the Princes of Change holding the center of the
Empire.  If he must risk his life by deceiving a Prince of the Empire,
let it at least be in a good cause!

Prince Eselne's retinue burst as one into uproarous laughter at Adlar's
announcement.  "A truce?" the Prince roared, "Are you mad, son?"

One of the Prince's advisors leaned close to speak to the Prince, and he
grunted, "True."  Turning to Adlar he said, "You say you came from
Sokatis?  How long did you travel?"

Now once again Adlar thought furiously.  It was fortunate for him that
Prince Eselne eschewed magic and telepaths, for his lies would be
quickly discovered by even the simplest sorcerer.  "For months sir.  I
was injured by Salarvyani raiders, and this good Ketengku priest," he
indicated Achan as a distraction, and the surprised priest of the
Healing-God nearly jumped, "and his children travelled with me during my
recovery.  The road was long, Mighty Prince."

The Prince and his retinue laughed again, "Too long, Runner!  Events
have outpaced your message!  Even now I go to march against my brother
across the Missuma River, and your tardy message fails against the
ramparts of my determination!  Rereshqala's head will adorn a pike
before noon tomorrow!"

Adlar blanched, but the Prince had already forgotten him, whirling and
stalking away with his generals to plan the morning's battle.

Adlar and Achan stood stunned, staring after the Prince, their appetite
for the feast forgotten.

It was little Tsa'a, of all people, who broke the silence.  From behind
them her voice piped up, "That poor man."

Adlar and Achan turned as one, as one they said, "What?"

"He's going to be dead soon," Tsa'a said, her face twisting with grief
as she cuddled her doll close to her ear.

"What, will he lose the battle tomorrow?" asked Adlar in amazement.  He
had learned to accept the strange abilities exhibited by Achan's
foster-children.

"Oh no," Tsa'a said, her eyes tearing.  "He will be dead within the
hour."

(Ray asks about the Heheganu)

Not much to reply here. The Heheganu are one of those Tekumelani 
"Underpeople" species (or sub-species) that could be elaborated on, 
but which are just not widespread enough or otherwise noticeable 
enough to need it. There are many of these limited creatures, some 
with interesting characteristics. The planet has just too many 
life-forms to make it simple to describe, however, as those who 
have visited Tekumel will tell you!

Several varieties of this Mihalli device exist. I think they were 
explained in the old article that appeaed in the "Dragon" magazine. 
Humans can operate these devices, altough they often get results they 
did not plan on.

Hi,
  
I'm Adam Crossingham and I'm looking for a Tekumel campaign to play 
in. Choice of rule system is not important, as I'm looking for an 
atmospheric and fun game. I hope to run an RQ-based Tekumel game in 
the future, but I want to get a feel for the pace and flavour of the 
game first. Hence the need for a game. 

Can you help? Have you a spare seat?
  
I live in Farnborough, Hampshire, but I would be happy to travel 
anywhere in Berkshire, Hampshire, Surrey or London; or further if the 
game is on at the weekend.
  
I've got 12 years of playing role-playing games under my belt, and I'm 
currently reff'ing a 4 year old Cthulhu campaign.
  
You can contact me at:
Adam_Crossingham@octavian.ccmail.compuserve.com
or on 0171 265 0071 x246 (work hours) or 01276 31551 (after 7:30 pm 
most other times)
  
I'd be very pleased to hear from you.

[Moderator's Note:  Dermot Bolton asks about hunting in Tsolyanu.  Dermot    ]
[                   also asks for other's accounts of hunting experiences in ]
[                   gaming on Tekumel.                                       ]

>I'm curious as to how the Tsolyani go about the noble art of hunting.  It 
>is obviously a pursuit of the nobility, at least as a sport. But what do 
>they do?  What weapoms are used?  How common are Kuni birds in hunting?  
>What sort of game would a typical hunting party pursue?  And just how

The peasants use short, heavy spears for larger game, while small game 
and birds are hunted with bows and arrows. Swords are pretty useless, 
and longer spears are efficacious only against really big and dangerous 
animals, such as the Tsi'il. The nobility use better quality spears and 
missile weapons, including some crossbows and rock-throwing bows for 
small birds.

Kuni birds are common as game-spotters. They tend to be unreliable, 
however, and hve sometimes been accused of taking the side of the game 
and reporting the whereabouts of the hunters to the animals! One recent 
hunt ended when the much-abused Kuni bird was heard shrieking "There he 
is! Get him! Get him!" to a family of Serudla below.

Near the cities there is almost no game left, and the great nobles of 
Jakalla and Bey Su must thus stock walled parks and preserves in order 
to offer some entertainment to their guests. Large game include the 
Tsi'il, the Serudla (who is smart enough to kill a party of hunters who 
are either stupid or unlucky), the Okhiba, the Nraishu, and the Jakkohl 
(a good small-game animal). Various species of birds are found, as are 
fish, edible lizards, etc.

There are families, lineages, and individuals who specialise in being 
guides and trackers, but I don't know of whole clans that do this. 
Maybe in the forests of Do Chaka or Pan Chaka? I also cannot speak for 
Salarvya or Yan Kor, where such tasks are often relegated to local 
tribes that are paid for their services. This is true in Rannalu and in 
the little states of the far northeast.


Some nobles and high clans maintain hunting preserves where lower-clan 
people are not allowed to hunt, but there is no univeral law providing 
penalties for poaching or killing deer, as there was in mediaeval England.

The high clans organise hunting parties -- one of the "Adventures on 
Tekumel" segments described one of these. Professional hunters and 
trackers are employed; servants take picnic baskets, musical instruments, 
and tents; more serfs provide drinks and snacks for those actually 
hunting; there are physicians and doctors in case of heat-stroke or 
accident; butchers and cooks are on hand to prepare the game that is 
brought back; and everybody troops around, enjoying little rendezvous 
with their favourite ladies and/or gentlemen. 

The trackers job is to provide the game, and the host will first thus 
make sure that there is game to be found. He will question his trackers, 
and in many cases quietly import game to be loosed in the forest just 
before the hunt.

A few larger and fancier clans also send along professional poets and 
bards to sing of the exploits of important guests. Music is provided, 
so you may find yourself locked in battle with a mighty Zrne while the 
bandsmen play in the background -- and flee madly away if you are 
defeated, and their turn is next!

If you are defeated and killed, your clasnmen may still pay for an 
appropriately tragic poem describing your demise.

A hunting expedition usually lasts from before sun-up to sun-down, but 
longer forays may be aranged for real afficcionados. Since really big 
game is not found close to the cities or the Sakbe roads -- any more 
than tigers are found close to Bombay -- the hunt must either be con-
ducted on someone's summer estate in the hills, or else game must be 
imported into a walled preserve near a large villa. 

All of this is very expensive, and only the great clans and important 
families can manage it.

Human-hunting is also popular with certain less-than-beneficent religious 
sects.  The followers of Vimuhla, Chiteng, cruel Hrihayal, and occasionally 
others may pay for criminals or prisoners of war to be brought and loosed 
inside large walled parks. This is very dangerous, however, since some of 
these erstwhile "game" are resourceful and may kill an important scion of 
a major clan, resulting in squabbling, disputes, and demands for Shamtla. 
This custom is slowly dying out and is increasingly limited to the Arenas.

Phil

As far as i know, the Qol do not wear jewelelry or ornaments. Their 
robes are often provided by their human controllers, although I have 
heard of some who wear robes stripped from the bodies of the dead in 
the cemeteries and underworlds below the great cities. They do seem to 
prefer full robes -- Nobody I know has ever seen a naked Qol! (The idea 
is just a little ugly...!)

If the original corpse's robes were ornate, I would assume that he 
Qol would not care enough to rip it off. Heavy jewellery and other 
impedimenta would be removed, of course.

>A quick question on the Renyu, I have them standing around four to four

Close enough. 4 - 5 feet tall is about right. I have heard of very 
large individuals (5.5 - 6 feet tall), but these are rare.

[Moderator's Note:  Mark Bee asks about Fasiltum and then a couple of         ]
[                   questions about slaves in Tsolyanu.                       ]

>1.)   I was looking on the map at the region around Fasiltum (The Desert of
>Eyagi). With Falsiltum being as large as it is (500 to 600 thousand people),
>I'm wondering how they all get food and water. Is there a really large oasis

Fasiltum has underground water supplies. I hope Chris has put the map 
of Fasiltum up on the FTP site! [MN: Yes] It shows the city and notes 
the great underground well that provides much of the water for the 
populace. There are smaller wells and water sources throughout the area. 
There is run-off from the Chayengar Range to the east and north, and 
this water pools up in subterranean caverns in the foothills and out 
below the desert. It is blocked from coming to the surface by various 
rock strata, except in places where the crust has broken through in the 
form of sinkholes and wells (like northern Yucatan). 

The people of Fasiltum are also skilled at desert agricultural techniques 
and have adapted their crops to the terrain and climate. It's not always 
fun to live there -- droughts have come and killed many -- but it is 
feasible.

>2.)   How much does it cost to support a slave in the empire. I estiamted
>around 10 K per year. I just wondered how close I was.

Support at what level?  A field slave costs about 10 K per year, if fed 
the cheapest food and clothed in nothing or no more than a g-string! A 
high-level slave, trained in fancy work, entertainment, etc. will cost many 
hundreds of Kaitars. Slaves must be kept up properly, if you don't want 
your property to deteriorate, just like a fancy automobile. Players are 
often shocked to discover how difficult it is to maintain the "beautiful 
slavegirl" they buy so blithely in the marketplace! Food, clothing, 
ornaments, medical treatment, training, and occasional gifts ... It can 
add up.

Unless you're operating a big clan plantation, or you are noble and 
wealthy enough to be able to do it properly, my advice is not to 
purchase slaves.

>3.)   I know that in the empire having slaves equiped with weapons is
>illegal, however can a slave have a knife for cooking and cutting rope and
>things like that or is the knife taken from him/her as soon as they are
>finished using it.

Slaves often have weapons -- they are not supposed to, but they do. Just 
like prisoners in American penitentiaries, knives, "shivs," "shanks," 
and other devices are common in the slave-pens. Mattocks, hoes, hammers, 
etc. are found buried under the floors of half the slave barrakcs in 
the Empire, I suspect. 

Of course, slavss are forbidden to have real weapons and may face any-
thing from a flogging to impalement for owning them. Owners who arm 
slaves as bodyguards are either stupid or criminal -- or both. Don't.

[                   Tekumel.  Interesting message Adam!                      ]

I've been playing Tekumel off and on for 10 years.  However, it wasn't 
until a recent trip to Tokyo that the impact of no maps hit me full 
force.

The Japanese have an unusual custom of not naming streets.  Only about 
5% of the boulevards in Tokyo actually have names.  Therefore, it's 
virtually impossible to find your way around with a map.  Complicate 
this with the fact that the city was intentially laid our irregularly 
in order to confuse an attacking army.  I had to walk about six blocks 
from the subway to my hotel and was forced to ask for directions twice.

From a Tekumel perspective, directions would only be given in terms of
landmarks.  In a very large city, a non-native would have to depend of 
guides and pelanquins to get around; going to a new city would be 
terribly frustrating.  If the guide or pelanquin master didn't actually 
know how to get to a destination, I could easily see a 10 minute journey 
turning into a three hour fiasco as the group becomes lost.  Of course, 
the guide or master will not want to give up his/her fare and would not 
think of admitting that they really don't know where they're going.

For a foreigner possessing limited or non-existent language skills, 
getting around a large Tekumel city would be amazingly frustrating and 
frightening.  Given the insular culture, a foreigner could starve 
before someone directs him two blocks away to the Foreigner's Quarter.  
Similarly, the experience of Tsolyani citizen with no local contacts 
visiting a foreign city like Tsamra would be about as terrible as I 
can imagine.

[Moderator's Note:  The Professor responds to Adam's message on Maps.        ]

Adam has some interesting -- and absolutely valid -- perspectives on 
maps and cities. We are so used to being oriented within out environment 
that we forget that this is a fairly recent development in human society. 
Earlier cultures had no maps of their cities -- or just impressionistic 
maps (like my first map of Jakalla, published with EPT) -- and getting 
around in a new place was a pain indeed!

If Japan is confusing, try India. My first experiences in Lucknow and 
Delhi and Benares were fraught with apprehensions of becoming throroughly, 
irretrievably lost! When I asked an elderly Muslim scholar for his 
address, he replied something like: "Go a mile beyond the Chauk on the 
road, stop by the blue mosque, where the big pipal tree is standing. 
You'll see a betel-nut vendor's stand, and if you go into the alley 
behind it and walk about a hundred paces, you'll see a tunnel leading 
left that opens into a courtyard where there are flowers. My house is 
just beyond by the pond." One of my friends laughed and added, "Don't 
forget to mention that it is under the tree with the pigeon sitting on 
the limb." Another friend chimed in, "If the pigeon flies away, you'll 
never find it."

I tried his directions and unexpectedly came right to his house on the 
first try. Later, when I went again, I had to ask directions from the 
betel-nut vendor since I'd forgotten. But people in these societies 
generally know everybody and every place in their locality, and they 
can guide you. I've had more trouble with crooked taxidrivers and 
unhelpful passersby in New York than I ever did in India, Pakistan, 
Saudi Araia, Iran, or wherever my work took me.

We take so much for granted!

Most guides and palaquin-masters know their cities very well. Only if 
he wants to cheat you and take you all around the place to raise the 
fare might he mislead you.

You are right. That's why you should get in touch with your clan's 
representatives in a foreign Tekumelani city before going there. If 
your clan is not represented, try writing to the Tsolyani legate 
(or whatever country you're from) -- they usually have servants and 
guides for their nationals. These people will meet you at the dock or 
city gates and take you to a predetermined clanhouse, or resthouse. 
If you are a priest and have a temple in the new city, you won't have 
a problem. One of the usual tasks for small-boy acolytes is to serve 
as guides for visitors.

[                   worshippers of the Pariah Gods.                           ]

Sunuz and certain other languages used by the followers of the Pariah 
Deities are not well known, but they are not forbidden. Both Thumis 
and Ksarul (with Ketengku and Gruganu) teach at least the rudiments 
of these languages in the larger temple academies in Bey Su, Jakalla, 
Thraya, Hmakuyal, etc. You won't find many people who know them, of 
course, and those who claim that they do are often charlatans or 
dabblers who don't really have much of a grasp. The temples do not 
encourage these studies, but they feel that it is important for 
*somebody* to know them, and students who are so-minded are allowed 
to proceed -- but always under the careful eye of older scholars who 
can discourage those who might find *too* much fascination in the 
arcane doctrines of the Pariah Gods. There is no particular danger in 
studying the *languages* themselves, but what is written in those 
languages can take hold and twist your mind right around the bend! 
That is why most study of the Pariah Deities is done with the guidance 
(and iron control) of senior scholars.

>In addition there is Zna'ye, the ancient tongue of the Goddess of the Pale 
>Bone.  Is this language also banned within the Five Empires? I'd also be 
>interested in similar details to those listed above.

Zna'ye is only rarely taught in any of the Five Empires. I think there 
was a scholar-priest of Ksarul (one Deragu hi-somebody -- I forget now) 
who had some competence in it, but since it is spoken only in Nuru'un, 
halfway across the world, and since it is kept a dark secret by those 
who use it for their religious rites, it is hard to learn in Tsolyanu, 
Mu'ugalavya, or Yan Kor. It is listed as "available" in certain 
curricula of the temples of Ksarul, Gruganu, Hru'u, and -- oddly 
enough -- Sarku in the largest cities of Tsolyanu, but I don't know 
anybody who has ever claimed to have taken those courses.
