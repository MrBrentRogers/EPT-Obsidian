These messages are the accumulation of the messages that were sent out on 
the Blue Room email list between May 1995 and June 2000.  A large portion 
of the information is directly from Professor M.A.R Barker. When the list 
members joined during the time the list was active, they agreed to refrain 
from sharing this data with non list members.  When the list ended, it was 
urged that the data be made available to non-list Tekumel fans, and it 
seemed like a good idea all around.

I only ask that if you download these digests, or have received them in 
some other way, please respect the agreements the list members made, and 
refrain from passing them around and instead point people to the Tekumel 
web site, www.tekumel.com so that they can download them for themselves, 
and see all the other material available on the Tekumel.com web site.

Many Thanks.

I like the idea of a list of "dramatis personae." Names are generally a
problemfor non-Tsolyani referees, but the ones used here are quite good.
The scenario is well organised and structured.

[Moderator's Note:  Michael Schwartz asks about the Nighted Tower Clan.   ]

>Hey folks,

There isn't a lot more to tell. There are a half dozen shadowy "semi-clans"
or "incipient clans" at the bottom of the Tsolyani social ladder. These
groups compete for members, business, and economic-political influence, The
great clans usually ignore them, unless there is a need for them. A tomb
guard is not a high-prestige person. He/she would be more welcome than a
slaver-clansman but less desirable than members of the agricultural or
craftsman clans at a feast.

Some members of the Nighted Tower clan are involved in making chemicals
used for embalming and the purification of tombs and corpses. Others are
tomb guards, hired and paid by other clans to protect catacombs and
underground sepulchres. These persons are not employed to guard buried
shrines to any of the gods; each temple has a contingent of soldiery, who
are charged with maintaining the sect's subterranean temples. Still other
priests are sent down to perform the ceremonies there.  Nighted Tower would
have no more access to the interior of Lord Sarku's huge complex under
Jakalla than any of the other clans. Members are usually devotees of Sarku
or Durritlamish. There is another smaller separate clan made up of
adherents of Lords Belkhanu and Qon, the Chamber of Yellow. These factions
are quite hostile to one another.

Rightly or wrongly, Nighted Tower has a reputation for occasional tomb
robbery or at least pilfering. It is said in Purdimal that if you want to
acquire some of your great-grandmother's teeth with which to brew up a
magical fertility potion, Nighted Tower can get them for you -- complete
with her name etched on the enamel!  Tomb robbery is a serious crime in
Tsolyanu, punishable by death, and the business of looting graves is more
risky on the surface than it is underground.

You ask about Nighted Tower outside of the northwest. As far as I know,
there are no clanhouses or groups of members anywhere east of Bey Su and
down the Missuma River to Jakalla. Thraya and Penom both have local
incipient-clans: e.g. The Protectors of Sweet Decay and the Arjumi Society,
to name two.. The northeast is divided between the Fasiltum-based Guardians
of Forever and an unnamed tomb-protective association which does not aspire
to clan status. The south and southeast use the services of the Amber Urn
of Memory. All of these are hardly more than tradesmen's organisations at
present, but there are pressures to make them into formal clans. Imperial
recognition may be long in coming, of course.

The distinction between Belkhanu/Qon and Sarku/Durritlamish is important
here: the former specialise in funerals, "spiritual matters" connected with
death and the world to come; the latter, as might be expected, are focussed
upon the protection of the corpse and the resurrection of the Intellect, as
Lord Sarku preaches. On the surface, these groups appear to cooperate;
underground, real combat sometimes occurs. They also play tricks and commit
sabotage upon one another.  I recall one instance where a squad of Nighted
Tower members were sent into the Underworld beneath Usenanu to protect the
tomb of a newly deceased member of the Golden Sunburst clan. The leader of
the Chamber of Yellow came to know of it, since his first wife's sister had
married into that clan. The Chamber or Yellow secretly sent a gang of
diggers down to excavate a deep trench all around the new sepulchre. When
the Nighted Tower people were inside, the Chamber of Yellow leader called
out insults and obscenities -- and had his people pull out supporting balks
of timber, entirely surrounding the new tomb with a 10-foot deep trench
into which they emptied urns of serpents, epeng, biting insects, and other
noxious creatures -- not the most poisonous, but enough to hurt. They then
offered to build a bridge for those who would surrender their armour and
their clothing to the gleeful Chamber of Yellow people. After a number of
days without food and being bitten by creatures that crawled up onto the
central tomb platform, the Nighted Tower people gave in and left in some
disgrace. The Golden Sunburst clan discovered these shenanigans and had the
Chamber of Yellow charged with an Imperial crime: defacing tombs. The case
is still proceeding, with talk of high Shamtla - the trench had made the
ground under the Golden Sunburst's sepulchre unstable, and the priesthood
of Belkhanu reported that the deceased Golden Sunburst tomb-owner was being
harassed in his coffin by legions of vicious vermin. (When asked for proof
of this, the priests brought forth a group of psychics who -- they said --
had direct contact with the dead on the Isles of Teretane. Not everyone
believed them, but the Imperium wants to maintain the honour of the great
clans and the sanctity and solemnity of the catacombs. There'll probably be
a  payment of a couple thousand Kaitars to the Golden Sunburst clan -- and
another couple thousand to the Imperium to pay for settling this.

Best regards.

I'd love to be able to help, but this is rather a lengthy topic.

The story is probably  exaggerated in the telling. "Assembled Salarvyani
forces" probably only included some local units from Khum and Koyluga. In
many periods, Salarvyani troops were noticeably less-well-trained than
their Tsolyani counterparts.  The "defeat" was perhaps not much larger than
a standard  Qadarni battle.

The Pechani lean heavily on the Tsolyani to help maintain their
independence from Salarvya. It is thus no surprise that the aristocrats of
Pechano were so happy to hand over a princess of the blood to the Tsolyani
general, As I recall, he took her home with him, but she did not much like
the hot, flat plains of the central Empire. After a few years, she left
him, taking her children with her, and returned to Mechaneno, where she
lived a secluded life for several decades.

The  details of the wedding are too long to be included here. The Pechani
have always had a sort of "honourable enemy" relationship with the Grey
Ssu, and it is no surprise to encounter this sort of rare visit. In
reality, the Ssu "king" probably was provided with a separate room from
which to view the ceremonies. Communication between Ssu and humans was
done, as it is today, with gestures.  Neither side speaks the other's
language. The Pechani are adept at this. They still fight the Ssu regularly
but have occasional non-hostile contacts as well.

For a copy of the Tsolyani epic poem, try the great library  of the Temple
of Karakan in Sokatis. I think the librarian, my old friend Tekuo
hiFershena, knows where it is.

[Moderator's Note:  Peter Bismire offers this treatise on Falconry.       ]

Kunakh -  Falconry on Tekumel

"Dense forest and mountain crags. A larger sub-species is found in the
northern mountains of Yan Kor.

These brownish birds have limited intelligence, plus the ability to
speak in simple terms if trained by a bird-trainer. They are thus useful
as hunters and spies, since they can report back on the disposition of
troops, terrain, etc. They can be trapped, lured down with aromatic
Tsural-buds (a 50% chance), or shot down with blunt-headed arrows
smeared with a sticky substance. The Kuni will try to escape but cannot
fight. They are inedible."

This is the description of the kuni bird from the Tekumel Bestiary and
as with much else it has been greatly simplified to allow for a
reasonable space in a gaming compilation. The following will I hope add
to this basic information and allow visitors to Tekumel to appreciate
these beautiful flyers.

Kuni birds in fact have a much wider range than the Bestiary description
allows, although their basic preference for raised nesting sites and
drier hunting conditions normally excludes them from swampy terrain.
Even then there are reports of a smaller black-bodied type from Haida
Pakala but as this is too small for hunting use it is not captured like
its larger brethren and has escaped close attention.

That said a wide range of subspecies exists covering all of the main
continent (and offshore islands). The northern Yan Kor species mentioned
in the Bestiary is in fact the size of a small eagle and as far as I am
aware unused for hunting. The local tribes (Lorun?) however use its
hunting as an initiation test in some of their rituals and the Governor
of Khirgar's small museum has a number of tribal "decorations" made
using its wings and feathers.

The hunting ritual involves building a "hide", either a pit or a low
raised circle of rocks and covering it with branches to conceal the
hunter. A small decoy device in the form of a small animal is then used
to attract the bird's attention and when it stoops the hunter grabs its
legs. As these are not small birds, the struggle is severe and while
maybe not life threatening the beak and claws can leave impressive
scars. It is also known for the hunter to subsequently die of infections
from these wounds as the talons are rarely clean.

More conventionally sized birds are distributed in a wide band across
the continent and include both short- and long-winged types. The
short-winged types inhabit forested areas (though not the dense forests
mentioned in the Bestiary) where the greater manoeuvre ability comes
into play. The long-winged are hunters over open fields and more likely
to be familiar to the average person as they can often be seen using
updrafts from sakbe roads to gain height before swooping on prey on the
ground.

In all species the male tends to be about a quarter again larger than
the female and responsible for most of the hunting while the females are
smarter and tend to have larger vocabularies.

The birds communicate with an impressive internal "language" but can use
only a limited number of human words. Even then they tend to have
atrocious accents and it usually requires some familiarity with the bird
to understand its meaning. Depending on how they have been trained some
birds can have bad habits including repeated demands for "foooood" every
few minutes.

The kuni-bird as mentioned tends to prefer nesting in elevated positions
including cliffs but also high trees when these are unavailable and then
normally the tallest in the area. The nest is constructed from dead
twigs woven into a tight mass and reused year after year.

During the nesting season the female lays three eggs which hatch white
down covered young. The parents work full time feeding their brood with
small creatures (including epeng!) That they catch in the surrounding
area.

The pairs tend to be territorial and some clashes take place at the edge
of these territories with tumbling sky-fights that rarely result in
serious damage to the participants. This can affect the "tame" birds as
their flight across another birds "space" can lead to one of these
fights thus distracting them from their mission. More than one commander
has been informed of a "great fight" by his kuni bird only to discover
it meant itself and not warriors!

Most wealthy clans have a mews set aside for its birds and depending on
the current fashion both within the clan and society it can be a large
bustling place full of birds, trainers and slaves or a dilapidated ruin.
In charge of this there is a "chief falconer" once again his condition
and skills can vary depending on the sports current popularity. He is
normally assisted by a bevy of lesser handlers in the direct care of the
birds with the more menial tasks being carried out by slaves.

As with so much else on Tekumel the kuni bird allows for an ostentatious
display by the owner whether in having rarer birds ie the white-flecked
kuni from the hills near Fasiltum (one of the long-winged breeds) or
heavily jewelled hoods (the Tsolyani word is hlasfarzhailukh literally
"bird-mask"?), jesses (vaglakh?) and other equipment. Almost universal
is the use of inscribed rings of various materials including bronze,
silver and gold around the bird's right leg corresponding to the
medieval varvel.

The glove (ambukh?) is usually made of heavy leather with double
layering over the thumb and first two fingers although some have also
been made that included light chlen hide plates. The latter are usually
used with the breed of Kuni birds from the Chakas (a short-winged type
distinguishable by its white and black wing tips and the white circles
around the males eyes) due to their larger claws and are usually
referred to as a "Chakan glove".

Contrary to the traditional Terrestrial European (and Japanese) habit of
holding the bird on the left hand the inhabitants of Tekumel all as far
as it is known use the right hand. This may be because of the lack of a
need to hold reins with the right.

With the hoods two main types exist corresponding to what falconers in
our times would refer to as Dutch (in this case Tsolayni) and Indian (a
type mainly used in Salarvya). In southern Tsolyanu the types mix in use
with Jakallan falconers recommending both for different circumstances.

The kuni can be flown at most reasonably sized game but in southern
Tsolyanu the preferred quarry is the sahelu (sp?) with frequent hunting
parties setting out from the cities, towns and villas to hunt the bright
golden birds. A side custom for this is the tradition of the hunters
wearing white conical hats although nobody seems to know why this is or
when it originated.

On the other hand there are some unexpected risks to the hunt as well.
Falconers, around Purdimal in particular, must be wary of their charges
hunting the Qasu bird which is sacred to Hru'u. The Temple of Hru'u is
always prepared to claim shamtla for each bird taken and whole estates
have been confiscated during some Imperial reigns, the charges based
purely on a pathetic bundle of purple and black feathers.

The most frequent sources of birds are professional catchers who
normally supply newly fletched chicks taken from the nest. Purchasing
birds in the markets, you are most likely to find available the "eyases"
or rejects from the mews. There is a section of the market in Bey Su
where bird specialists gather and sometimes you can find better quality
birds trained by freelance handlers here. Once again quality can vary so
caveat emptor (Professor is there a suitable Tsolyani expression?).

More rarely adult birds are captured and trained (equivalent to what
were once known on Earth as passage hawks) but these are largely the
efforts of an individual enthusiast and his trainers. This is where the
use of trapping nets, sticky arrows and most of all Tsural-buds comes
in. Apart from its effects on the human metabolism the reaction of the
kuni to Tsural is like a cat to catnip and it is frequently used as a
reward to just returned birds to encourage their return in the future.

The more normal trade in Bey Su is the centralisation and dispatch of
birds from one end of Tsolyanu (and beyond) through the dealers here
with much of the trade being on the "special order" category.

The best way to obtain good birds is direct negotiation with owners and
possibly as gifts. Also a prize bird or pair as a gift in the right
places can help a career immensely.

Depending on how you feel about falconry be careful about introducing
the subject at feasts as the ability of an aficionado to talk about his
birds is legendary and can lead to the clearing of entire rooms as a
small knot of enthusiasts argue the fine points of the sport. The clan
mothers will NOT thank you for your efforts.

This is actually a very good and useful question, but I have to share with
our fellow list members that John is asking it because his character,
Arkhane hiKetkolel, agreed to not act as a sorceror for three weeks as
penance...  so he's kind of anxious to know *precisely* when it runs out.

Actually, until fairly modern times, many cultures changed the date at
*sunset*. The Moslem and Jewish calendars *still* do this. That's why
"sabbath" rectrictions run from sunset Friday to sunset Saturday.

Other cultures have chosen sunrise. For them, a given date starts at
sunrise, and ends at sunrise of the next day.

Clocks led to midnite being chosen. Even so, astronomers have long
preferred to change the date at *noon*, so as to not split a night's
observations over two different dates.

Even with my limited knowledge of Tekumel and Tekumelani customs, I'd
expect that *all* of these are indeed used for different purposes.

For that matter, do the books note if hours are of equal or equal
lengths? Sundials led to hours based on the azimuth of the sun (ie the
angle from due north or south). If you use equal angles, then the hours
are of differing lengths. 

Just what sort of clocks (and time keeping in general) are used? All I
have are the original TSR rules...

"For the next three weeks, you are not a sorceror."

It's an interesting question.  As a member of the legal profession, I can
see several ways to argue it.  ;-)  I think the answer is likely to depend
on culture -- especially where high-status Tsolyani, who are supposedly
vague about precise times, are concerned, I'm not sure that "three weeks"
would be taken as "three weeks worth of seconds, starting immediately".
*We* would probably take it that way, or at least find that interpretation
acceptable, but Tsolyani may have a more rigid conception of when a week
starts or ends, to say nothing of when the day starts or ends.

If he's smart, he'll go with the longest of all the reasonable
interpretations, in order to be safe.  It's a penance to Hru'u, after all.

But you have to admit it's a good question.

[Moderator's Note:  Professor Barker replies to Peter's message on Kunakh. ]

Excellent study of the Kuni bird!  There are various sub-species, of course,
and even a few in the northeastern deserts whose plumage is a beautiful
reddish brown, with a purplish sheen to it. Your descriptions of the bird,
its habitat, and hunting, etc. are particularly good.

The governor is still squabbling over these "decorations" with the Lorun
tribes, who claim that they are "sacred" and should not be displayed to
outsiders.  One of the tribes offered the governor a "fistful" of gold, but
he refused.  Governor Chankodla hiSenkolum collects weapons and trophies.  He
is a tough old man and firmly believes the Imperium has a right to whatever
its officers capture.  He did hint at a trade, however: the Kuni bird
decorations in exchange for a pretty maiden of his choice.  This time the
Lorun refused.  There the matter rests -- for now.

One often can recognise a Kuni-bird hunter by his scarred face, lack of an
occasional eye, etc.

The birds are passable scouts, but not everyone can understand their
"speech."  I recall one campaign against the Pijjenani on the northern sea
when five or six Kuni-birds came flying back screaming "Pedhenyal"
("islands" along the coast).  The Molkar in command of that part of the
legion heard "Pedhuyal" "enemies" and mobilised his forces.  After standing
around looking silly for the best part of an afternoon, he ordered up a
small squad of Hlaka to report the true facts -- and then retired into his
tent to sulk.

[                   the new day starts.                                  ]

You know, this is a subject I have never yet researched.  It is indeed an
interesting topic.  It seems that most Tsolyani (and others of the Five
Empires as well) hold that the day dawns when the top of the sun-disc
appears above the horizon (as seen from some local eminence, such as a
tower, a hill, etc.).  The followers of Lord Hru'u claim that a new day has
come when the top of the sun-disc has *descended below* the horizon,
leaving the land in darkness.  I think the other "dark temples" agree, but
most average Tsolyani (etc.) go with the majority and consider dawn to be
the start of the day.  Hnalla, Avanthe, and Dilinala have a slightly
different idea: they say that days dawns when there is "enough light to see
an Epeng in one's bed" -- i.e. about 4=5 A.M.

The concept of midnight as the start of a new 24 hour day seems to be
rather rare on Tekumel.  Dawn (usually) is the start of the day; see above.
There are other customs, however: many people measure time by the clamour
of the great Tunkul gongs.  One thus speaks of "Avanthe's Sweet and Holy
Voice" (in Jakalla and Bey Su both).  Folk also say, "the Singer in Velvet"
to designate Lord Ksarul's deep, minor-chord gong, usually sounded about
midnight throughout the Empire.  There are probably other terms in
different cities as well.  Certainly the above terms would be untranslatable
into Mu'ugalavyani or Yan Koryani.  The Livyani are probably the best
time-keepers: their temples are always equipped with sundials and water
clocks.  The role of time in their theology has not yet been explored. --
And they show no inclination to enlighten the rest of Tekumel.

I cannot actually comment on this particular question, except to add an
aside. One the characters in Patrick Brady's campaign claims to be a
descendant of this legendary hero, with whom he shares his name.

Serqu hi Nereshan of the Clan of the Broken Reed is from Thraya, and is
currently (2359) serving as a soldier and archer with the 12th Medium
Infantry in their defence of the Akotel (sp) [Atkolel?] Heights. He is 
known for his skills in Marotlan and Charage, and for being popular with 
women.  His Thrayan is also rather strong (the only accent I can really 
do is a West Country/Mummerset one and this has become the Thrayan accent 
in the game!)

>cheerfully 'take a bullet' for him at need, yes?

This final comment actually raises another option, as both the priests
of Thumis and his cohort Ketengku, have individuals who actually do
this. In meetings between priests (whether of opposing factions or
different temples), no weapons are allowed, but occasionally somebody
will successfully sneak a small knife in... This is where those trained
in the art of unarmed combat come in...

There are two. Dederatl is taught only by the Temples of Thumis and
Ketengku, whilst the Temple of Ksarul teaches Huon. Dederatl uses the
hands for a very quick response, whilst Huon is based on the use of
kicks.

Dederatlokoi are trained to react to threats very quickly. Their aim is
to stop the attacker long enough for their superiors to retreat and for
the armed temple guards to rush in deal with the threat. Though some may
be able to, they do not kill, but with either powerful blows or strikes
to vital points, they aim to stun. One important aspect of their
training is that they can deal with armed opponents as they wear very
snuggly fitting vambraces used to parry and inflict blows. This parrying
ability also extends to the blocking of missiles as well, though this is
a much more difficult skill.

My main character, Urukai hi Kharsan, of the Clan of the Hall of Stone,
and nephew of the noted astrologer, Orun hi Kharasan, is training to be
a Dederatlokoi. He is an average student at the Monastery of the Grey
Cloak, studying to become a priest of the Temple of Ketengku.

Unfortunately, his grades of late have not been as good as he hoped they
would and he has travelled into the Akotel (sp) Heights to find a
singing master and cram for poetry exams. All this in the middle of the
war with Yan Kor! In the light of his skills, and a letter from his
uncle Orun, he has found himself assigned to an undercover mission to
determine the whereabouts and safety of some captured clansman, equipped
with only a medical bag, a book of basic poetry, a large packed lunch
and instructions to practise singing scales with a clan cousin each day!

"The concept of midnight as the start of a new 24 hour day seems to be
rather rare on Tekumel.  Dawn (usually) is the start of the day; see
above."

        I'm not sure just when Europeans adopted that concept. Medieval
monks developed a water-powered alarm clock for night-time prayers
(reconstructed today, it actually works!) but the Roman conception seems
more appropriate to Tekumel, where metrical time is not a priority: They
measured the day, literally, as twelve hours long from sunup to sunset (why
we refer to the time period as a "day") and did not measure the night at
all, save for the military, which divided the time of darkness into
"watches" of roughly two-hour duration. Naturally, dividing the duration of
daylight by twelve produced "hours" of wildly varying length, depending on
the season, but noon was always noon...
        -- wherein the Romans assiduously observed siesta; the streets
became so silent and deserted that at least one Roman writer chose this
period as the proper time for a ghost story!

        "On March 20 and September 23, when darkness and light were equal,
Roman hours were equivalent to ours. On December 22 the day was less than
nine of our hours long, and each hour not quite forty-five minutes; while
on June 21 a Roman day was over fifteen hours long, and each hour about
seventy-five minutes."
        -- Mary Johnston, "Roman Life," 1957, p. 25

        The Swords and Glory sourcebook speaks of how Tsolyani aristocracy
in particular disdain any attempt to metricate time; things take as long as
they take, and the subjective experience of duration is what counts. That's
very much the Roman attitude as well, and I suspect the cultural result
would be essentially identical.

In theory, I will be attending GenCon; in practice, I may have other 
obligations which will preclude my presence. I may or may not be 
gamemastering demos of the forthcoming "Hero Wars" (Greg Stafford's new 
Glorantha roleplaying game) during the weekend; if I have adequate free

In recompense for my unfortunate cancellation due to illness last year, I

As Games department head at Rider's Downtown with a booth to staff, I 
will likely be free to gamemaster only on Friday evening. My concept of 
the game has evolved since last year, so the previous event description 
will not suffice. I'll pen a new one in the next few weeks and email it 
to you (or whomever acts as U-CON Events Coordinator this year) before 
mid-August.

campaing follows, which was originally posted to Alt.Games.frp.Tekumel:

Some of you may know me for my occasional stupid comments, others by my
Tekumel PBeM game "Clan of the Radiant Dark".  By popular request (actually
by one guy who begged me to let him play) I'm starting a new game entitled
"The Voyage of the Mokaltokoi Tsomun".

Unlike the first game, this one will be hosted using a moderated ONElist.
(Not my first choice, but RPG Host is untended right now -- I cannot even
get the players names for my current game corrected.    If you wish to
subscribe as a Lurker or a player, you can do so by going to

didn't misspell anything!!!  Oh, for those of you need to type the address
in, the last part is Mokaltokoi_Tsomun with an underscore.)

The Mokaltokoi Tsomun is a ship commanded by Charash Tlakatoni, the second
cousin to God-Emperor Mirusaya.  Charash Tlakatoni's intent is to explore
the Southern realms of Tekumel.  He has assembled a group of mercenaries
(mainly Shen and Ahoggya), sorcerers -- mainly priests of Hru'u and Avanthe
for their obviously useful spells that can be used to mitigate the harsh
environment -- and noted scholars and explorers.

Charash is in need of brave men and women like yourselves to help in the
expedition.  Though he is the ultimate authority, he knows that he has
neither the knowledge nor skill to discover and handle what he may find in
the unknown portions of the world.

Tekumel newbies are welcome.  They may choose to start with a Tekumelani
character (with help from myself, of course) or a character from any others
world -- There are Nexus points on Tekumel which makes such happenings
possible.

There are a maximum of five players in the game.  So far one and a half
slots are filled.  So a possible three, maybe four people will be accepted
as initial players.  E-mail me directly at turgon@nidlink.com in order to
reserve your position.  Include a brief character description of what you
would like to play and a list of any Tekumel gamebooks -- not source books,
just the rules systems -- that you currently own.  List the game system that
you are most familiar too.  For those without a single copy of a Tekumel
rules system (there are at least four), then list any and all PRG rules
systems that you are familiar enough to use for generating characters --
Personally, you should stay away from D&D and AD&D and stick with more skill
oriented systems, but if that's all you know, then that's fine too.  The
rules system is basically only used for character creation and benchmarks,
and is otherwise irrelevent.

[Moderator's Note:  Scott Maxwell asks about Tsolyani Body language.     ]

I have always been interested in cultural variations of body language.
Seeing that the Tsolyani ultimately came from non-Western cultures, I have
been including some non-western body language.  Most notably, the wobbling
of the head from side to side to indicate agreement.  I am, however,
unsatisfied with only this change -- especially since I don't know if it is
"real" in Tsolyani culture.  Seeing that body language is non-verbal
language, I thought that you, Prof. Barker, would be able to reveal some of
the secrets of Tsolyani body language.

>>Has anyone has come across any of the temple, legion or Golden Sunburst

As I said, there is a narrative poem describing his history (probably
exaggerated and apocryphal). There is also a prose treatise somewhere in
one of the libraries of the Temple of Karakan. A few folk stories exist as
well, although these take on the style and "colour" of similar tales from
the Epic of Hrugga.

Broken Reed is a low-medium ranked clan. Most of the current Serqu's
clansmen are Golden Sunburst or Golden Bough, and it is doubtful whether
they would even deign to recognise the genetic relationship of someone from
Broken Reed.

I, too, use a completely fake "British-peasant" accent to simulate the
speech differences of lower class Tekumelani. This is easy and
recogniseable, but it is *not* "realistic" in linguistic terms. My
"peasants" do sound different, but my players do not speak Tsolyani and
would not know the difference between a Bey Su slum-dweller, and a Thrayan
farmer. So...  Of course, my lower-class "Tsolyani" dialects are *not*
really "British"; they're sort of like them but only an imitation. An
example? My players once encountered a Chlen-cart loaded with produce on
its way into Bey Su from farms out of Berenanga Plain to the west of the
city. The accents of the carters were so thick they were nearly
unintelligible! "Y'gots to git the veggy-tubbles outa t'sun afore they
rots..."

Just "fun" for local colour!

Charash is indeed a "royal," though distantly. There are hundreds just like
him, scattered all over the Empire: everybody from fisherman and farmers
through bureaucrats, priests, and minor aristocracy.  Charash is probably a
bit arrogant about his Imperial connections, but so are a lot of others.

>Would he us the 'I' Lukan or the 'I' Salum?

He himself may be daring enough to use /salum/ for "I." This is too high
for him, however, and only if he is rich and prestigious would he use
/lukan/. Informally, he will employ /lum/, like most other Tsolyani of
medium status.

>Would he be adressed with the 'you' of profound submission (tusmitlakomelu)
>or the 'you' of eminent splendour (qalotusmi)?

This depends on Charash' profession, age, and demeanour. If he is a
warrior, people may address him as /tusmikang/ "the you of martial
victory." If he is a priest, he can be addressed as /tusmishan/ "the you
of perfect piety."

He does not seem to be old enough or prestigious enough to merit
/tusmitlakomelu/. He is also probably too far from any direct relationship
to the Imperial family to warrant /qalotusmi/.  Using this eould be seen as
presumptous posturing. As the hero Hrugga said to the Epeng-king in the
folktale: "Better to be humble than stepped on!"

The Tsolyani navy is a collection of "legions" rather like the army. The
Imperium provides some funding, and the mercantile clans (particularly in
Jakalla, Penom, etc.) provide more, as long as the "navy" serves clan
interests by helping shipping and keeping piracy down. Militarily, each
ship has a staff of officers, equivalent to the army ranks, but the ship's
captain (who is also termed a /kasikoi/, just as in the army) belongs to a
"council" of captains, under the direction of senior officers, who mostly
are retired ship captains. The Imperium chooses a "legion commander" (=
/Kerdukoi/ "general") through the Palace of Ever-Glorious War to administer
the legion. There are currently two regular naval legions, which are
briefly described in the Tsolyani Army List and also in "Deeds of the
Ever-Glorious."

Tsolyanu's coast is not conducive to naval invasions from Salarvya or
Mu'ugalavya, although these have been tried. The coast of Pan  Chaka is
thickly forested and rocky, with few coastal towns or villages. To the east
lie the swamps around Penom; then the shallow, muddy waters of the great
estuary of the Missuma River. East of Jakalla, the coast of Kaija is
similarly no very suitable for naval warfare. Distances are also too great
to encourage raids and invasions. Tsolyani warfare, thus, is  "land-based,"
rather than "sea-based."

For more information, please contact the offices of General Tlaneno the
Steersman in the Palace of Ever-Glorious War at Jakalla. He maintains an
adjutant or two to advise ship captains, travellers, merchant clans,
sailors, etc.

Sincerely,
Phil

Matters are really as you probably expect. The Ssu rarely -- occasionally
-- trade by "silent barter" with the Pechani along the northern border of
the latter little nation. The Pechani clan leaders lay out a sheet of cloth
dyed bright yellow (to attract the Ssu -- or to tell them that the humans
have peaceful intentions??). On this, they place small clay dishes piled
with certain minerals (e.g. copper sulfate -- for unknown reasons).  Bits
of metal, parts and junk from machines from the time of the Great Ancients,
etc., modern ewers, urns, and other metal vessels are also sometimes laid
out. The humans retreat to the safety of one of the local fortresses. At
night the Ssu come chiming up from their underground labyrinths. They lay
out metal item, gems and jewellery found in the old ruins, a few minor
magical items (an Eye or two), clay pots filled with unidentifiable
substances (which the humans throw away at once), and other trinkets. The
creatures then take whatever of the humans' items they wish and depart.
There are no words spoken, nor is there ever a physical confrontation --
which would almost certainly lead to bloodshed.

There is very little of this non-hostile contact; otherwise I would have
said more about it.  Other human nations either do not know of this Pechani
custom or else do not care. In the north, the dwellers on the shores of
Lake Parunal have a similar arrangement with the aqueous Nyagga, although
there the trading is more structured and frequent.

Occasionally a Tsolyani merchant will visit the northern villages of
Pechano and trade for curiosities of Ssu manufacture. Ssu gems, usually
egg-shaped, crudely faceted, and pierced with many little twisting holes,
are popular among the aristocratic ladies of Sokatis and Thraya.  The metal
items traded by both sides are generally useless. Efforts to build up the
trade of cloth, foodstuffs, and other items have almost universally failed.

As for the wedding, it is probably apocryphal or totally imaginary on the
part of the story-teller. As far as I know, the Pechani have never done
anything to make good relations with the Ssu. Instead, they have fought
them furiously, whenever they have come into contact.

Sincerely,
Phil

Hello,

I'm planning to play a priest of Hru'u, a sorceror of moderate power.
Unlike some other temples (e.g. Thumis, Vimuhla), I've found particulars
about who the important people are (and how they're spending their time) 
to be a bit sparse.  Can anyone provide news of the purple-robes?

I'd be especially interested in what sort of priest might be suitable to
accompany Charash Tlakotani on his voyage to the far south, and in knowing
what sorts of political positions the temple finds itself in these days.
How did they weather the political struggles?

many thanks,
George H.

There are frequent or at least occasional references to "blind barter" on
Tekumel. 

Is this something that has happened or happens here on Earth? Are there any
examples you could share?

[Moderator's Note:  Andreas Baede asks some miscellaneous questions.     ]

Hi everybody,
I am fairly new to Tekumel and I am still busy trying to absorb all the
information I have collected. My intention is to launch a (the first ever
?) Tekumel campaign here in the Netherlands in a couple of months' time.
Meanwhile, the following questions have popped up in my crazed mind:

1) Music to accompany Tekumel games. What kind of music is used to add
atmosphere to Tekumel roleplaying ? Does anyone (including of course
professor Barker) have any ideas about this subject ? In the Gamescience
Sourcebook the professor mentions that music in the western regions
(Tsolyanu, Mu'ugalavya, Yan Kor, etc.) uses the diatonic scale, and that
the pentatonic scale is used in the eastern regions (Salarvya). 
However, the pentatonic scale (I'm quoting the Encyclopedia Britannica
here) is found, in different forms, in most of the world's music. The same
goes for the diatonic scale, so that doesn't give me any idea how Tsolyani
music is supposed to sound. The illustration on page 17 of 'Coming of Age
in Tekumel' of a Tenturen player suggests that I have to look to Indian music.
Personally, I am tempted to use any music that I can't clearly identify as
'western', 'Chinese', 'Indian', or whatever. And there is a lot of that
around. For instance, I once used North Sumatran music to accompany an
1880s Chtulhu adventure set in Atjeh, in northern Sumatra. First thing my
players exclaimed was that it 'didn't sound Indonesian'. And anyone
interested in how a Nluss song might sound should try Tuvan music (it's
from Tuva in the ex-USSR, northwest of Mongolia), it MUST ruin the singer's
throat...

[Moderator's Note:  Someone suggested Coil as good Tekumel music.  Check    ]
[                   the old messages.  I remember it being somewhere in the ]
[                   400s.  Try 412.                                         ]

2) About the Urunen. According to the Gamescience Sourcebook and the
Bestiary, they live on a small continent near the South Pole, and until
recently they have not had any contact with Humankind since the Latter
Times. Now, I have the impression that the climate of the Urunen lands is
reasonably pleasant (cool temperate climate, like northern Europe ?).
If so, why was the Urunen continent not settled by humans ? After all, they
ran the place for tens of thousands of years, and I seem to remember having
read that the Urunen only migrated there after the cataclysm. Or did the
human population there go extinct ? (perhaps with a little help of our
Urunen friends ?) Or is the climate more like northern Siberia, and nobody
bothered to go there ? Or did humans and Urunen amicably agree to swap
places ?

3) The fall of Engsvan hla Ganga. According to all the sources, this
catastrophe had widespread effects - the rise and sinking of lands,
disrupted weather patterns, etc. Am I right to assume that not only the
Tsolyanu continent was affected ? That ALL of Tekumel suffered (indirectly)
from this catastrophe ". If this is the case, can one expect a 'break' in
the history of all Tekumel contemporary with the fall of Engsvan hla Ganga
? Even in the case of the Urunen lands mentioned above ?

4) And now for something completely different. I am currently reading quite
a bit of cultural anthropology, and I have stumbled upon the subject of
infanticide (I hope nobody takes offense...I know our modern western
sensibilities can't abide the idea of infanticide. Sorry). At least in the
Empire of Tsolyanu women have access to lissutl root (and how effective a
contraceptive is it? How widely known among the various human societies on
Tekumel ?). But what when a woman accidentally does get pregnant ? Are the
children cared for by the clan, sold as slaves, abandoned on the doorsteps
of a temple, or just, well, thrown in the river ? (In 17th century
Amsterdam, there was a special organisation to fish dead people - mostly
little children - out of the city's canals. And that was in one of the
richest and most sophisticated cities of 17th century Europe, with many
charitable institutions. At the other end of Eurasia, in 19th century
Peking the bodies of dead babies (some of them partly eaten by dogs and
rats) were collected from the streets, thrown in carts, and buried outside
the city. I used it once to shock my players in a Cthulhu adventure set in
1880s Peking).
Are there cases of 'indirect' infanticide ('accidentally' rolling over
babies, starving them, being very careless with them, etc. 19th and early
20th century German working-class women, for instance, sent unwanted,
'surplus' children to a wet-nurse known in the local neighbourhood as a
'Engelmacherin', or 'maker of angels'. With predictable results for little
Fritz or Gretl).
Not a very nice subject, but something that may illustrate something of the
life and squalor of the lower classes in Tsolyani society.
Anything known about the situation in the other Human societies of the
northern continent ?

Sincerely,
Andreas Baede 
The Netherlands

[Moderator's Note:  This week's administrative message.  Aug 14, 1999    ]

I have installed smartlist and procmail onto my mailserver, and will begin
working with it soon.  When I am ready, I will cut the list over to it and
enlist the help of some moderators.  At that time, the way the list functions
may change a bit.  I'll still make digests for newcomers, and they'll probably 
be placed on the web site.  I'll keep you informed.  (Please remember, I 
work at a school, and this is now my absolutely busiest part of the year.  I
may be relegated to Tekumel stuff only on weekends.  Especially since my wife
has taken a job where she travels most of the week.)  

In other news, it seems I will be visiting the UK this September/October.  We'll
be in the London area some, vacationing in the Lake District, and visiting my
brother in Aberdeen.  I'd like to meet some of the UK list crowd, if you guys
would like to do so.  It looks like I'll be there from about 9/21 to 10/5.

------
Our only other message comes from Ted Lyng.  He has bunches of Tekumel stuff
to trade.


I have noticed that you sometimes allow messages regarding Tekumel
merchandise.  I have a number of items to trade that I think would be of
interest to people on the list.  I hope you can post the following:

TEKUMEL ITEMS TO TRADE

I have a number of Tekumel items that I would like to trade for OOP
Tekumel items.  If there are no offers for trades, I will consider
selling the items for cash, but I am mainly interested in trading my
items.  I am also willing to pay cash for the items I want:

WHAT I HAVE:

1) German Tekumel --  I have obtained some copies of "Kindheit und
Jugendjahre in Tsolyanu" (Agema Verlag Detlef Wenzlik, 1994).  This rare
German item had been thought unobtainable.  The Professor and Chris
Davis have mentioned in a Blue Room message (#757) that this edition has
nice artwork.  Tekumel collectors will enjoy the beautiful full color
cover and black and white drawings inside (none of the illustrations are
available elsewhere as far as I know).  And if you speak German you can
even use it as a rulebook!  I have six copies (three mint, one near
mint, one very fine, and one fine).  German hobbyists estimate 200-250
were printed but I have not turned up any others for sale.

2) Tekumel Journal No. 1 (Imperium Publishing 1977)  According to Bruce
Roberts, 500 were published.  I have seen a copy auctioned for $60.00.
Much of the text has been reprinted on the web, but it has some nice
artwork that is otherwise unavailable, as far as I know.  I have one VF
copy for trade.

3) Tekumel Journal No. 2 (Imperium Publishing 1978) Again according to
Bruce Roberts, 500 were printed and only 150 were bound.  Everything
described above for No. 1 applies to No. 2 as well.  I have one fine
copy for trade.

4) Dragon #4 (December 1976) -- This very rare early Dragon is an almost
all-Tekumel issue with a beautiful color Tekumel cover.  Early Dragons
like #4 are expensive from dealers.  This copy has some wear and a very
faint crease on the cover.  It has no other defects.  I rate it good to
very good.

5) 2 x War of Wizards (TSR, Bagged edition. 1st printing 1975).
Recently reprinted by Carl Brodt, this was for a long time one of the
hardest to find Tekumel items.  The first printing has counters cut
horizontally and perforated vertically.  These go for high prices on
ebay and the newsgroups.  I have two copies.  First copy: rulebook --
some dinginess and one faint spot on cover, otherwise no marks; Turn
Record Sheet -- a red pen line has been drawn with a ruler to divide
"hit points" from "spells cast;" Tables: have just a bit of writing in
pen; Board: some wear but clean; Counters: halfpunched; Not the original
plastic bag.  Second copy: Rulebook -- NM; Turn Record Sheet -- A bit of
pencil writing; Board: clean with just a bit of wear; Tables: clean with
just a bit of wear; Counters -- punched; original bag.

6)  Extra EPT Maps.  This is a set of the three original maps from the
TSR EPT (Western Tekumel, Eastern Tekumel, and Jakalla).   They are in
mint condition, meaning they come with deep folds as all the maps did
originally.  Carl Brodt sells just the Western original map for 4.95.

7) The Tsolyani Language (Adventure Games, 1981).  This grammar and
dictionary of Tsolyani is in near mint condition.  This version has a
tan cover with a drawing.  It does not include the cassette tape.

8) Deeds of the Everglorious (Adventure Games, 1981).  This history of
the Tsolyani legions has just a slight bit of graying from shelf wear.
Overall it is in very fine condition..

9) The Armies of Tekumel Volume 1: Tsolyanu.  1st printing by  Imperium
Publishing.   Carl Brodt sells this for 4.95. This copy is in near mint
condition.

10) 2 x Legions of the Petal Throne (TSR, 1977).  The original miniature
rules for Tekumel.  Two copies available.  Copy one has some scuffing
and a faint spot on the front cover.  Copy two has some cover scuffing.
Other than that, neither copy has any other defects.  The perforated
pages are still untorn in both copies.  A copy of LPT sold recently on
E-bay for over $60.00.

11) 2 x Northwest Frontier Maps (Adventure Games, 1979).  The same ones
(originals) sold by Carl Brodt for 4.95.  I don't have the gazetteer for
trade.  I have two mint copies of the set of maps.

12) 2 x Man of Gold (DAW Books, 1984).  The original Tekumel novel.  I
have two copies.  Both copies have just a few lines along the spine and
a very few tiny nicks on the edges.  No creases or visible wear on
either cover and they lie as if they have never been opened (though they
have, I think).

13) Flamesong (DAW Books, 1985).  The second Tekumel novel.  I have one
copy that is not as nice as my copies of Man of Gold.  It has some very
visible lines along the spine and some crease lines near the corners
front and back.  Still, one of the nicer copies I've seen of this old
book.

14) The Nightmare Maze of Jigresh (Judges Guild, 1985).  To be honest, a
so-so early adventure with so-so artwork.  Carl Brodt now sells this for
3.95.  My copy is in fine condition with just a touch of scuffing.

15) Space Gamer #71.  A special Tekumel edition with a vey interesting
interview with M.A.R. Barker.  Near mint condition.  A copy of this
recently sold for $13.50 on E-bay

(I also have some non-Tekumel rare FRP items for trade.  E-mail me for
details.


WHAT I WANT:

1) War of Wizards (TSR 1975) Boxed Version.  The boxed version of WoW
apparently came in two versions: one had two figures and one had a strip
of four small figures.  I would like a copy of the version with two
figures.

2) Empire of the Petal Throne (MAR Barker self-published edition, 1974
or 1975).  Bruce Roberts describes this as published in two volumes with
pale green covers and no artwork.

3) Empire of the Petal Throne (TSR "1.5th" printing 1975).  The first
printing of the TSR EPT had a box that was blank on the bottom.  The
second printing's box  had some text and a black and white picture of
the game contents on the bottom.  However, I know of one copy that has a
box with just  text on the bottom  and blank space where the picture
appears in the the second printing.   Any others out there?

4) Empire of the Petal Throne (TSR 2nd printing).  I am looking for a
near mint copy.

5) Empire of the Petal Throne, Gamescience.  I have yet to meet anyone
who has actually seen this.  I have an all white perfect bound edition
of EPT with no marking as to publisher, but I think this is actually the
Tekumel Games Third edition.  Has anyone seen a version marked
Gamescience?  If so, I'd like one.

6) The Book of Ebon Bindings (2nd edition, Adventure Games, 1981).  The
1991 black version by Different Worlds is called the "2nd Edition" but
Adventure Games also printed a "2nd edition."  I'd like one.

7) The Tsolyani Language cassette tape, 1981.  I have the books.  I
would like the original tape.

8) The Armies  of Tekumel Volume 3: Mu'ugalavya (The Tekumel Journal,
1983)
9) The Armies of Tekumel Volume 4: Salarvya (The Tekumel Journal, 1983)
10) The Armies of Tekumel Volume 5: Livyanu and Tsolei (The Tekumel
Journal, 1983)
11) Miniatures for Tekumel Painting Guide (The Tekumel Journal, 1982)
(Note: For items 8-11 I want the original Tekumel Journal-published
editions, not the Carl Brodt reprints)

12) Qadardalikoi (1st Printing, Tekumel Games, 1983).  My copy of
Qadardalikoi is marked "second printing."  I would like the first
printing.

13) Swords and Glory Index to Volume 1 The Source Book (Tekumel Games,
1985) (The original.)

14) The Tsolyani Primer (Tekumel Games, 1982).  The original of the work
now published on the net.

15) Man of Gold (British Edition).

16) Eye of All-Seeing Wonder 1,2,4,5 (1992-1995) I would like the
originals not the Andrew Lorince/Carl Brodt reprints.

17) The Imperial Courier Vol 1 #1-6, Vol 2 #1 (Tekumel Games August
1984-August 1985) and Vol 2 #2 (Tekumel Consortium Spring 1987)

18) The Best of the Journals Volumes II and III (Tekumel Games 1986)

19) Journal of Tekumel Affairs Vol III #1-4, 6-9 (Thursday Night Group
2360 A.S.-2361 A.S.)

20) The Imperial Military Journal Vol II No 1-5, 7 (Thursday Night Group
2358 A.S.-2361 A.S.)

21) Realms of Wonder (James Roach)  I am interested in all issues.

22) Missum! (Tita's House of Games) I have the original.  I am looking
for the reprint by Carl Brodt that itself is now out of print.

23) World of Tekumel Temple of Vimuhla (unspecified handout listed by
Bruce Roberts)

24) World of Tekumel Battle Kibitzers Guide 1&2, 3&4, and 5&6 (GenCon
19?? handouts)

25) Gateway to Tekumel Character Information Booklet

(Items 25 and 26 are from Curtis Scott's planned PBM game.)

27) An Introduction to Tekumel (GenCon 1989 handout)

28) Citizenship Documents (Listed by Bruce Roberts with no other
details.)

29) Swords and Glory Volume 3 Referees Guide (Exists as a typewritten
manuscript.  Brett Slocum has a copy.  It is unclear to me whether there
are any other copies.)

30) Northwest Frontier maps (first and second printings).  Carl Brodt
now sells the third printing.

31) The Imperial Dispatches Volume I (listed with no details by Bruce
Roberts)

32) Dispatches to the Imperium (listed with no details by Bruce Roberts)

33) Last Imperial Courier (Bruce Roberts lists this, which contains the
article "The Temple of Dlamelish," as unpublished.  it is unclear to me

[Moderator's Note:  Gordon Neff comments on music for Tekumel.           ]

The illustration on page 17 of 'Coming of Age
in Tekumel' of a Tenturen player suggests that I have to look to Indian
music.
Personally, I am tempted to use any music that I can't clearly identify as
'western', 'Chinese', 'Indian', or whatever. And there is a lot of that
around. .


        I'd have to agree with those musical choices entirely -- and don't
forget Africa.  I've used Indian ragas, Balinese temple music -- there are
even some classical Japanese pieces, for shakuhachi particularly, that work
extremely well.
        As a side note, now that the "train to Communism" has finally
coasted to a complete stop at last, one of the stranger legacies of this
last, largest application of the "White Man's Burden" has begun emerging in
examples such as Irina Mikhailova's "Russian Twilight," which I highly
recommend for this purpose.  She, like so many Russians, was born and
raised in some howling godforsaken sandheap of rocks and flies in the
"Republic of Kazakhstan," where (as usual) the local cultures exerted a
greater influence than the thin, faraway voices that whined and crackled in
over the shortwave.
        As a result, though her language is Russian, her musical background
and training owes very little to Western Europe.  The result is odd,
beautiful -- something of an acquired taste to the MTV-weaned, but then, so
would Tekumel itself be!


(<http://www.scapecast.com/onworld/CMO/irena.html> gives more information,
if you're interested;

[Moderator's Note:  Professor Barker answers George's question about Priests]
[                   of Hru'u.                                               ]

I think Chris' suggestion of a look at Mitlanyal is excellent. I have
several priests entered in my character database, but I agree: materials on
Hru'u are rather scanty. Part of the reason is the secrecy and deliberate
mystical obscurantism of the sect. It is hard to know what is being done,
much less why.

A Hru'u priest to accompany Charash Tlakotani (he's not Emperor, so the hi-
prefix would be possible: hiTlakotani) is not hard to find. The temples are
full of 'em, most with no real craft or skill, often without money or
property -- after the recent takeover of the administration by Mirusiya's
boys.  I can look in my files for a likely priest/sorcerer if you wish. You
might try:

Onorel	Veschur	Black Hood	Human	M	age 44	Hru'u	Paya Gupa
	Priest,	 Ritual		Spells:  regular list of priestly spells up 
	to 9th level.

Pleasant, thoughtful, scholarly. Knows Salarvyani and some of various other
languages. Unmarried. Has a mistress, who is from Butrus.  She rules him
with an iron first. He enjoys jokes, parties, and gambling. A risk-taker.
Acknowledges at least three children (2 girls & a boy) Rather handsome in
an unassuming way. No fighting skills.

Hope this helps.

Sincerely,
Phil

>Is this something that has happened or happens here on Earth? Are there any

>(It sounds like a fascinating subject.)

I read somewhere that blind barter was used between Christian missionaries
and certain South American Amazon tribes. The former left mirrors,
colourful cloth, etc., and the latter replaced these items with their own
various productions. There are probably other examples. It is not common on
Tekumel, but it does work -- as long as neither party fudges on the items
