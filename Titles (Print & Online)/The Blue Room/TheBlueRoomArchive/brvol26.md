These messages are the accumulation of the messages that were sent out on 
the Blue Room email list between May 1995 and June 2000.  A large portion 
of the information is directly from Professor M.A.R Barker. When the list 
members joined during the time the list was active, they agreed to refrain 
from sharing this data with non list members.  When the list ended, it was 
urged that the data be made available to non-list Tekumel fans, and it 
seemed like a good idea all around.

I only ask that if you download these digests, or have received them in 
some other way, please respect the agreements the list members made, and 
refrain from passing them around and instead point people to the Tekumel 
web site, www.tekumel.com so that they can download them for themselves, 
and see all the other material available on the Tekumel.com web site.

Many Thanks.

 [Moderator's Note:  James Maliszewski comments on Peter Huston's campaign ]
[                   materials.                                            ]

I, for one, would like to see more of this sort of material on the mailing
list. While I am always fascinated by new Tekumelani lore, I would
appreciate seeing information that has a more direct application to
roleplaying on Tekumel. As a previous message of mine has already indicated,
I have set up a small website that I hope will become a much bigger
repository of information about roleplaying on Tekumel.

I'd love to see more of Peter's notes and, if he'd like, I would be willing
to post them as a document on my website. The same is true of anyone else
who has gaming material that doesn't really belong either on this list or in
the ftp archives. Just e-mail me and we can discuss it further.

Thanks,

perhaps, but relatively rarely.  I would bet that the gain in ground
covered might often be lost to the slower rate of movement off-Sakbe.
Better to wait til the cool of night and then move swiftly by the red and

I had not known that the Maori and Samoans were physically huge. Are they
larger than, say, Scandanavians? I had thought that the Nordic sub-racial
type would be  the largest (save for some, like the Watusi of Africa, who
are exceptionally tall). It does look likely that the N'luss were
"engineered" for size and strength, but this does not necessarily mean that
they were direct descendants of any particular Terran group -- after all,
millennia passed between our own time and any possible starting date for
the N'luss,

N'luss legend states that they came from a "homeland" in the Plain of
Towers, and that they served as guards and soldiers in the armies of Lords
Vimuhla and Chiteng on Dormoron Plain. From this, comes the origin of the
Dragon Warriors, whom the N'luss proudly call "our fathers."

They may well have been some sort of special military unit landed on
Tekumel before the Time of Darkness. They have maintained their pride and
their physical prowess ever since.

>>Empires?

Most "high" folk in the Five Empires prefer to remain indoors during the
hottest parts of the day. Slaves and labourers have no such choice and tend
to crisp nicely. I know that only the weak die off during intense heat
coupled with physical hard labour -- I once watched a gang of several
hundred workers (including women and older children) carry baskets of earth
and stones up a mound to build a dam in India. The temperature was about
105 F! I was unaccustomed to this and left a trail of perspiration like a
slug on a hot griddle! The Indians shrugged off the discomfort and worked
all day.

Many middle-class houses in the cities of India have extensive cellars,
often interconnecting with neighbouring houses, where people spend the
summer days. I've used these cellars myself in the blazing heat of Lucknow
-- and went visiting underground to the next-door family via tunnel.

Sokatis is rather unique. It was developed by an early Tlakotani governor,
whose skin was extra-sensitive to heat. He had the arcades joined together
and roofed with thick slabs of coloured glass. Keeping this feature in
repair (and clean enough to see through!) is a major budget item every year
for the locals!

Other cities just swelter -- or dive underground. Building an entire city
underground is occasionally possible, of course, but expensive! If it were
easy, they'd have converted frigid Minneapolis long ago to a netowrk of
caverns. Montreal, Canada, where I lived for years, created a subway and a
system of underground shopping malls, offices, etc. that works quite well.
It *can* be done.

>It would seem that shade would be even more desirable on the Sakbe
>roads, unless everyone travels at night.  Do the roads have any
>such provisions, or do travellers have to provide portable shade?

Shade is indeed very desirable on the roads. As in India, many folk just
grimly bear up under the heat, sweat, drip, and march. The wealthy ride in
palanquins borne by slaves (who have no choice), but a good master is too
smart to kill off his slaves for nothing and so does not use them for this
except in emergencies. People carry sunshades, wear loose, dark headclothes
(like the Arab bedouins), and travel during the mornings and evenings, when
there is more coolth, and at night (but then seeing where one is going is
more of a problem).

Most Sakbe-road walls drop down into fields, low underbrush, rocks and
pebbles, and other undesirable (if not actually unwalkable) surfaces. You
*can* get down there and work your way along the wall, but it will be a
slow and thorny trip! Better to lie in and snooze during the day and travel
at dawn, dusk, or at night. This is not necessary, of course, during the
short winter season, when daytime travel is not so uncomfortable.

"The bootmakers get rich during the summer" (Tsolyani proverb): have you
ever tried to walk barefoot or with thin-soled sandals on hot pavement or
sand? When my wife and I were on Pilgrimage to Mecca, we circumambulated
the Ka'ba (the great square building in the centre of the sacred precincts)
barefoot on marble paving! The temperature was about 105 F. Needless to
say, we were not happy campers...  Later, when we went up to the Plain of
Arafat for the day of the actual Hajj itself, the temperature in our tent
reached 127 F by my Egyptian friend's pocket thermometer. Never was more
soda pop consumed...!

>a) unthinkable for social reasons.
>b) impractical because of terrain. (I'm sure it is in certain locales.)
>c) prevented by the "Sakbe-wardens".
>d) feasible

High folk never walk along beside the wall. They rent a room or a space
inside on of the road towers and "hole up." At dusk and before dawn there
is a lot of noise and hullabaloo as palanquin-masters get the bearers up,
feed them, pack luggage and ready the Chlen-carts. Then it's off onto the
road for a couple of hours or more until the traveller s decide to go to
ground somewhere. It is socially unacceptable to clamber along in the brush
and debris beside the wall.

Low and medium-level folk frequently avoid the Sakbe road altogether,
travelling on the network of village secondary roads. Others sleep on the
Sakbe road tower platforms (it is forbidden to sleep *on* the road pavement
itself, so people who cannot afford a qirgal or two to the road police have
to get off and sleep in a field or under a tree in the villages below.

Sakbe road police do not prevent people from walking along the bases of the
walls, Village and town constabularies may prevent travellers from
trespassing and ruining crops or gardens growing along the walls, however.
Mostly, such travellers end up walking on the network of secondary roads.
In some places, there are no secondary roads, of course (e.g. the swamps
around old Purdimal), and the Sakbe road is the only method of travel.

Perhaps you can understand why player characters who try to wear armour all
the time must roll dice every few minutes to check on heat stroke! Even in
European climates armour heats up unbearably because it cannot "breathe."
Strong knights used to drop of heat prostration.

[Moderator's Note:  Professor Barker comments on Peter's plants.          ]

I am happy to have you develop certain plants for Tekumel. They don't all
need to be horrid, ravenous, slime-dripping, sentient goobers, of course. A
few simple vegetables for environments outside the hot southern plain of
Tsolyanu might be nice: say, Ghaton, Mu'ugalavya, the coast of Salarvya,
various islands and ocean locales, etc. Send descriptions of these plants
to the Blue Room FTP sight, or, if they are useful for gaming, to James
Maliszewski, who is developing a website focussed upon *role-playing* and
not so much on sociology, etc.

What is Sanjesh' lineage name -- and the name of the girl he wants to
marry? We have a "Sanjesh" in our campaign here, but his lineage name is
"hiKirisaya," and it is thus unlikely he is the same person. "Sanjesh" is a
fairly common first-nasme in the higher Stability clans. It is said to have
been the name of a heroic, intelligent, and rational Thumis-worshipping
officer of the garrison of Ganga. When the island sank, he loaded one of
the last small boats with his wives and children (and others, too), braved
the tidal waves and temblors of the fall of Ganga, and made it across the
eastern passage to the swampy and jungle-covered shores south of Msumtel
bay, After a year of wandering and fighting Hlutrgu, he and his little
party managed to build a raft and paddle up Tamkade Bay to Heru, where he
was warmly received. He later returned to Tsolyanu, and there the tale
wanders off and ends. It is said that Sanjesh began as a very large and
sturdy man, but when he reached Heru, he was down to "the size of an
underfed boy." Many of his people had perished, and the tale lists only his
wife, Peri, her oldest son, Kanyel, and a couple of nameless servants as
survivors. The Golden clans still use the name Sanjesh frequently.

TOME and I did license "Gardasiyal" in German. This was published but never
sold. No one knows where the stocks (if any) went, and it cannot now be
obtained. It was named, "Tekumel - Kindheit und Jugendjahre in Tsolyanu."
It was translated by Hans Joachim Suetterlin, and was published by Detlef
Wenzlik, Agema-Verlag, Bauerheide 5, Postfach 2143, 44511 Luenen, Germany.
It was a very nice edition with pretty illustrations. Too bad it is
unavailable..

[Moderator's Note:  I saw Phil's copy and there is some very nice artwork!]

>While we are on the subject of unknown Tekumel materials.  I recall

I *wrote* science fiction before the publication of EPT, but these were not
*published* by the aforementioned magazines! They were too smart! :-)

One of my novels, "Man of Gold," was issued in a British edition ("Man of
Gold," Century Hutchinson Ltd, London. nd). The same book appeared in
German, "Der ungewoehnliche Goldmann: Abenteuer in Tekumel." pub. by
Wilhelm Goldmann Verlag, Berlin, 1986. Both of these are out of print,
alas. "Flamesong" was never translated or republished.

I won't bother mentioning my translations of Engsvanyali romances. Perhaps
Arjai hiVaisoner will oblige with more of his Tekumelani poetry?

I think that may describe a surprisingly high percentage of us. I
know it's dead on in my own case. I'm not really willing to admit that I've
"grown out" of RPGs-- and Tekumel is one of the major reasons. Can anyone
imagine paying this much attention to, say, Grayhawk, or -anything- TSR
does these days?

"Neither the government for the temples can make a person Nakome without
concurrence of that erson's clan. He *has* to be expelled first. There are
plenty of Nakomeyal anyway: lowest of the low people who perhaps never had
a clan, or whose parents lost theirs.."

How could anyone lose interest in something that -works out the
plural form- for its terminology?

I too have my little notebooks squirrelled away in a box somewhere.
I imagine most of us do.

Now, if only I could persuade Flying Buffalo to merge its own
Tunnels and Trolls, or begin producing Tekumel-specific modules...

[Moderator's Note:  James Maliszewski offers up some advice for our begin-]
[                   ning referee.                                         ]

My own thoughts are manifold, but I think I can narrow it down to two basic
pieces of advice that have served me well. They're related and work hand in
hand.

1) Start small and move slowly. Tekumel is a rich and complicated setting.
Few people besides the Professor know all of its complexities well enough to
integrate them properly without some effort. Use only those elements you
need for your beginning adventures. Add others as time goes on. Soon enough,
you and your players will become comfortable with Tekumel. It'll feel
natural and not nearly as inaccessible as it once did.

2) Remember that Tekumel is a fantasy setting. Sure, it's brand of fantasy
is different than most others. Nevertheless, you should never forget the
place of the fantastical and awe-inspiring in a Tekumel game. The Gods are
real. Magic exists. Ancient devices turn the tide of wars. These all need to
be accounted for. To forget them is to turn Tekumel into just another
hidebound, conservative land without much to offer the roleplayer. Tekumel's
cultures (for me, anyway) are as fascinating as they are because they offer
a wonderful juxtaposition with the fantasy that is also part of the setting.

Finally, you might want to check out my new website at
www.interlog.com/~maliszew/jade.html. It has some information that might of
use to someone beginning a new game.

Good luck and enjoy your stay!

<<It does look likely that the N'luss were "engineered" for size and
strength, but this does not necessarily mean that they were direct
descendants of any particular Terran group -- after all, millennia passed

Excuse me, but with all due respect, I doubt the 'engineering'
hypothesis strenuously. If there was any engineering going on, it was
entirely environmental, and yes, it took thousands upon thousands of years.
Heck, look at how long the entire Latter Times lasted! The Engsvanyali
civilization itself lasted easily long enough for any local equivalent to
the Maori, the Scandinavians, or the white Northern Europeans, for that
matter, to have emerged full-blown.

If you want to postulate some sort of special beginning, I'd
suggest 'transportation'-- that is, Australian-style convicts in a Tekumeli
gulag. Those who survived that environment would be Dragon Warriors
indeed-- as encountered one hundred centuries later...

[Moderator's Note:  I seriously doubt that Tekumel was used as a Gulag.  It]
[                   was terraformed as a vacation planet/playground of the ]

[                   marketing department could!) :-)                       ]

I'll admit, that does put a different spin on the Plain of Towers.
If those are millenia-old spacecraft, they may not have been -intended- to
lift off again, but merely to provide elementary shelter and sustenance for
the dumped-off criminals.

An aerial or low-orbital view would be instructive-- if they're
scattered higglety-pigglety wherever they happened to come to rest, this
would tend to support the theory. If they're ranked in regular array, that
implies eventual re-use was intended.

They've found jungle-swallowed Mayan irrigation canals with radar
interferometry. I wonder what the Plain of Towers would show.

Bravo on running a Tekumel game at a con!  I've run a short and incomplete
campaign, and three convention scenarios that were terrific.  There's
little to say about the campaign: I inherited the group, and ran a
run-of-the-mill kind of game where the PCs were basically following a
treasure map.  It was not well thought out, and was constructed one session
at a time.

My convention scenarios were designed to introduce newcomers to the
complexities of Tsolyanu and were not run of the mill at all.  All three
depended heavily on role-playing skill and are light on combat or game
mechanics.  I always included individual player goals, often contradicting
the goals of other players.

In "A Matter of Honor", the PCs were called upon to defend the clan's tomb
from tomb-robbers.  One PC discovered that his father, who had been
responsible for tomb offerings, had been robbing the tombs himself to pay
off gambling debts, so he was frantic to keep the rest of the group from
discovering the evidence.  The tomb robbers themselves were Zu'ur smugglers
who had concealed their stash in the tomb, and were trying to recover it. 
This scenario was published in an issue of "The Eye of All Seeing Wonder",
either the last one or the one before it.

In "Against the Grain", I reassembled the PCs from A Matter of Honor.  This
time their job was to defend the clan's grain warehouse from the annual
food riot, especially since the grain inside had been sold to Prince
Rereshqala.  Rereshqala intended to distribute the grain at the peak of the
riots to make himself look good and the Emperor Dhich'une look bad,  but
Dhich'une's agents intended to destroy the grain first to spoil
Rereshqala's plan.  Two PCs are old guard OAL agents, currently working as
mercenaries for Rereshqala.  Complicating matters are two Sarku-worshippers
among the PCs who will be put on the spot to either defend their Emperor
and betray their clan or vice versa.  Both times I've run this game players
roleplayed to the max.

"Unwelcoming Party" covered the efforts of the staff of the Tsolyani Legate
to Tsatsayagga to throw a diplomatic party for the grandees of Tsatsayagga
while simultaneously backstabbing each other, and then later on in the
evening, attempting to escape with their lives when things go sour.  This
scenario is fairly unique in that none of the PC's have any combat or magic
skills because they're all playing middle-aged bureacrats.

My first serious Tekumel adventure involved sending a group to
Mu'ugalavayani-occupied Do Chaka to rescue a sacred artifact for the Temple
of Vimuhla in Tumissa.  It ran long for a convention scenario, and
basically involved outsmarting the Mu'ugalavyani guards and smuggling the
article out from the temple after defeating the guardian.  In retrospect,
it was a pretty run of the mill kind of adventure, but it was a good
exercise for me and captured some of the feel of the Chakan frontier at the
time of Dhich'une's ascension.


Regarding the feel and mood of the games, these vary.  I prefer a game that
is loaded with detail and character but light on combat, while others play
a more D&D style game with traps, monsters, and loot.

contributions or sent comments so far.  In particular, scans and
information to make the Excellent Travelling Volume complete are always
required. I'd also like to invite someone to write a piece on the 'Recent

[Moderator's Note:  Al Musielewicz adds to the "Reality" thread.           ]

As to the reality of Tekumel, I myself have experienced this reality.  Several
times I have told the Professor to stop in an adventure and I will write down
what I see and what is in the room.  When he describes it, it is exactly as I
saw it.  What is interesting is that I have never been to these areas before
and further I have described things that I have not run across before.

[Moderator's Note:  Keith Dalluhn offers up an adventure idea to Kevin King.]

Someone was asking about ideas for a Tekumel adventure.  I will give you
either a starting, a middle or an end depending on which you choose.

Now, depending on how you want to run it, his fief could be the starting
point in an adventure by having the party meet Sanjesh in Usenanu and
offering the party a job in obtaining an item of your choice.  It could be
the middle of an adventure by having the party seek out Sanjesh to identify
or obtain an item from him.  Or it could be the end by having the party
deliver an item or message to him.

Sanjesh owns a fief about 6 hours walk along the river outside of Usenanu.
The walk to his fief is not grueling, but should be undertaken early inn
the morning as to avoid the hottest part of the day.  Travel at night can
be done but is not recomended.  About a tsan from the actual home, you wil
begin to see well tended fields of Dna grain, and orchards.  The laborers
and slaves all seem well fed and content with their lot.  They will all
mention that Lord Sanjesh is a kindly master to work for.  Mainly because
none of them, for the most part, have ever met him.

The trip through the fields is easy, and the house proper sits on a small
hill surrounded by a 4' high wall.  It is built on a low stone platform
reminscent of the temple in Usenanu.  The gate is usually guarded but
sometimes not.  People can be seen doing menial tasks such as tending the
gardens of the house, or hanging laundry.  The chlen pens can be seen off
in the distance behind the house.  The guards will direct the party to the
major domo of the house.  He will tell them that Lord Sanjesh holds court
to hear petitions in the early morning.  If the party looks trust worthy
and has equipment they will be asked to camp near the far wall inside the
compound.  If they are untrustworthy they will be directed to stay outside
the fence.  High level guests will be directed to a small outbuilding where
they will be set up nicely with baths and a servant of their own.  When the
party is actually led into the house proper, it is designed like a typical
Tsolyany manor, save for a large circular hole that extends the entire
length of the house.  It is about 2 feet across, and in some rooms has been
filled with glass.  There is a chance that Sanjesh will not be home when
the party arrives.  10% of the time he is gone.  40% of the time he is at
the temple, and the other 50% he is home.


Sanjesh hiKirisaya is the scholar high priest posted to the temple of
Thumis in Usenanu.  He is in his 30's, average hight with a middle age
spread already starting.   It is widely known that Sanjesh is an outgoing
kindly fellow who has a great interest in devices.  When the party meets
him there is a 90% chance that he is with his wife.  She is a stunning
beauty with large almond eyes,  a pale complection and glistening jet black
hair that nearly touches the ground.  She will be introduced as the Lady
Ais (ah' ees).  As the party talks with lord Sanjesh she will interupt with
questions of her own, and will whisper advice to lord Sanjesh.  Sanjesh has
several loyalties, they are, in order:

1  His wife and family (he has a child)
2  Lord Horodai.
3  Prince Mirusiya.
4  The empire.
5  His Temple.

Lord Sanjesh is, as stated, a kindly man.  He will help parties as best he
can.  Giving gifts of money, advice or devices.  He has a 90% chance of
recognizing the name of a device.  He has a basement full of items.  He has
most any eye known to man, and a long list of devices.  There is a 75%
chance of having any eye asked for, and a 35% chance of having any given
device.  Wether he is willing to part with any of them is up to the game
master.

One last thing, should the party attempt to harm Sanjesh, his wife and
family or his lands, they are in for one of the worst fights of their
lives.  Lady Ais has her patented 'Moonbeam' spell.  She is able to slowly
open her closed and cupped hands to produce an invisible wall that turns
any living thing it touches into nothing more than dust motes.  Lord
Sanjesh has a large arsenal of devices he can bring to bear on the party,
and failing that, he is able to call on the Demon Horodai who has an
uncanny ability to eat many people at one time.  Any party he meets is well
advised to be polite.

Should you have any other questions, please feel free to ask.

[Moderator's Note:  Joe Saul informs us of a Tekumel track at a regional con.]

I was going to hold off until I had more specific event information, but
those posts about having given up gaming sounded so unbearably sad, somehow.
I felt that I had to offer this to those of you who would *like* to game in
Tekumel, but can't find anyone to do it with... as well as those who already
have groups, but like to meet new Tekumel fans.  And anyone else I've
omitted...

Tekumel at U*Con!
=================
Come to U*Con, November 20-22, in Ann Arbor, MI.  We'll be running a special
"Tekumel Track" all weekend, with role-playing, minis (hopefully), seminars,
and a free-form with a guest appearance (voice only) by Professor Barker via
speakerphone.

If the reason you aren't doing Tekumel gaming any more is, in part, the lack
of a group of people to do it with, we can help you -- if only for a weekend.
We've got a small but active community here in Ann Arbor (you've met myself,
Lisa, Michael Schwartz, and George Hammond on the list; we're only the tip of
the iceberg) and we're hoping to draw in folks from as far away as the West
Coast.  Carl Brodt is even considering showing up with loads of neat stuff
for you to buy...

TekumelCon didn't work out -- but we can hold our own mini-TekumelCon,
piggybacked on a long-running (10 years) and very successful regional gaming
convention.  This Track *will happen*.  I have chaired U*Con two years
running, and now it's my turn to have fun instead of spending the con
worrying whether everyone else is.  Please come join me!

Logistics & Pricing
-------------------
Ann Arbor is 30 minutes (if you adhere to speed limits) from Detroit Metro
Airport (DTW), a major Northwest hub and International Airport.  Shuttles run
regularly from the Airport to the convention site (it's on the UM campus).
Hotels are cheap.  Crash space may be available.  The con costs all of $15
for the weekend, plus $2 per game (and the weekend fee is waived for GMs).
We're a very cheap con if you can drive.  Given the November date and our
local airport, we're even relatively cheap to fly to.  (Hint for US West
Coasters and Southerners:  Southwest flies here.)

Special Offer
-------------
Come over from Britain, and I'll personally pay your convention fees.  And
buy the first round at one of our local brew-pubs.  (I may also be able to
find you cheap, or free, housing.  Airfare is your problem.)

Contact Information
-------------------
U*Con's web page is at http:/www.deathstar.org/~ucon, with general
information about the con.  It's slightly out of date (it doesn't mention any
of the special events or Guests of Honor), but what information is there is
accurate.

If you're interested in the Tekumel Track, please contact me directly either
by email (jmsaul@umich.edu) or phone (+1 734 429 8427).  I'm still recruiting
GMs and people who want to run miniatures events (and have access to minis!),
so don't hesitate to volunteer.  If you just want to play, or hang around and
talk Tekumel, that's great too!

[Moderator's Note:  The Professor and Bob Alberti respond to Keith's intro ]
[                   to Sanjesh and his fief.                               ]

Professor Barker says...
Dear Chris and Sanjesh,

This is one of the best introductions to a Tsolyani fief and its owner I
have yet seen. Sanjesh lives and breathes! You didn't go into Ais' family
background, of course; that might have been too much to contemplate. But
you see her *exactly* as she is. You may also have to explain the circular
hole in the wall...

This can be used just as you described: beginning, middle, or end of a
scenario. Now you'll have to introduce the new party to some of your (ahem)
friends, like Arjai, Chitlasha, Arumel, I'ena, Nisaya, Mirek, Mt'tk, Takan,
and Echine.

A note for Sanjesh; please pass it on to him:

Wish I could join the new party on an adventure or two, but several of us
are off to visit the Island of Vridu, where we shall be guested by Lady Deq
Dimani. She still pines for her lost Tsolyani lover, Ahan Basrim, but she
is going on with governing her island and performing the flame rituals of
her temple. As for me, I look forward to a pleasant sea voyage with a
certain lovely Tsolyani spy, one Kalusu hiViridame. I tire of gloomy Ke'er
and family squabbles.

Rejoice,
Baron Ald of Yan Kor

Regards,
Phil

Bob Alberti adds...

>Someone was asking about ideas for a Tekumel adventure.  I will give you
>either a starting, a middle or an end depending on which you choose.

Note that two thirds of the time, Sanjesh ends up with more items than
he started with.

>Sanjesh owns a fief about 6 hours walk along the river outside of Usenanu.

During the war, this fief traded hands about as often as a Salarvyani hooker.
Draw back the new-looking tapestries in any part of the house and you'll
find obscene grafitti regarding Dhich'une's endowments.  Slaves are still
scouring the walls.

>The laborers
>and slaves all seem well fed and content with their lot.  They will all
>mention that Lord Sanjesh is a kindly master to work for.  Mainly because
>none of them, for the most part, have ever met him.

Note that recently many of them met Lord Sanjesh when they were invited to
view him as he stood at the balcony of his home.  Strangely enough, their
descriptions of Lord Sanjesh will not be consistent.   Lord Sanjesh' home
was recently commandeered by a Dhich'une loyalist named Elon, who tried or
is trying to undermine Sanjesh' position by assuming his identity for a short
time, installing a temple of Sarku, running up the water bill, etc.

If you visit Lord Sanjesh and he is small, slender, and wearing a lot of 
copper, you're well advised to pretend to be itinerant beggars and continue on.

>the house proper sits on a small hill surrounded by a 4' high wall. 

Four feet high?  I thought it was at least twice that tall, and I should know.
I've camped outside that fence many times.

>If they are untrustworthy they will be directed to stay outside
>the fence.

Oh.

>High level guests will be directed to a small outbuilding where

Hey!  The rest of the party never told us about this...

Two feet across? I thought it was at least twice that wide.  And I should
know, I was there when it was made.  Maybe that's why I sleep outside...

>There is a chance that Sanjesh will not be home when
>the party arrives.  10% of the time he is gone.  40% of the time he is at

Right now there is a good chance that someone POSING as Sanjesh will be home.

Note that interest is not the same as competence...

>the Lady
>Ais (ah' ees).  As the party talks with lord Sanjesh she will interupt with

Despite the fact that both will be adorned in kilts, it will soon be clear
which of the two wear the pants...

>He has a 90% chance of recognizing the name of a device. 

Again the terminology is important.  This states that, if you mention the
name of a device, Lord Sanjesh will recognize the name.  This does NOT say
that, presented with a device, Lord Sanjesh will know what it is.  This,
however, will not stop him from trying to operate the device...

>He has a basement full of items.  He has
>most any eye known to man, and a long list of devices.  There is a 75%
>chance of having any eye asked for, and a 35% chance of having any given

Whether any of them WORK is also up to the game master.  Here's a helpful
guide:  TOP TEN HINTS YOUR VISIT SHOULD END QUICKLY

 10) Eye, when button is pushed, begins to make a FIZZZ sound.
  9) Lady Ais' hands take on a silvery sheen, especially on the palm.
  8) "Have you met my friend Horodai?"
  7) The box in Lord Sanjesh' hands emits a grid of blue lights.
  6) Lord Sanjesh says, "Here, let me show you how this works."
  5) Copper box, when opened, curtly instructs you, "Shut de box."
  4) "Woops.  Ais, maybe you and the child should go visit your father.  NOW."
  3) Pink goo begins to appear out of nowhere.
  2) "Hm, it's never done THAT before..."
 
  And the number one hint your visit should end quickly:

  1) "Maybe I'd better ask my friend Arjai for assistance."
 
>One last thing, should the party attempt to harm Sanjesh, his wife and
>family or his lands, they are in for one of the worst fights of their
>lives.  Lady Ais has her patented 'Moonbeam' spell.  She is able to slowly
>open her closed and cupped hands to produce an invisible wall that turns

Keith exaggerates of course.  The party will not be in for any fight at all,
since they will be dead faster than a red-shirted Star Trek lieutenant during
the teaser..

With these caveats in mind, a stay in Lord Sanjesh' fief is bound to be a
delightful experience, with all the nobility, dignity, and hospitality that
a Lord of his stature can convey.

Unless, of course, Thumis chorales make you want to toss your cookies.

I recall a colour-blind player who could "see" Tekumel's various military
uniforms but couldn't tell whether they were green or red!

When are you finishing up the article on Onchash Chairan? Your experiences
there make you invaluable!

The player party got to Eyloa's House in the Tlashte Heights, met a gaggle
of the Undying Wizards at a party, and then found out the festivities were
held to welcome Eyloa himself home. Most of the Livyani high command showed
up to plan strategies against the Mu'ugalavyani oppressors, including
Narayeb, Fire-Face, Rua, Eyloa's son (Darkia), and Achan himself. Good to
see them all again.

[Moderator's Note:  Dwight Grosso continues on the N'luss.                  ]

My original idea, of the N'luss being "engineered, does seem a bit far
fetched. The concerpt of the N'luss being who they are from being a product of
their environment does seem to have merit. Consider our own world for a
moment. How many people in the United States are physically larger than their
parents and grandparents? I stand 6' 6", towering over all but two of my
relatives. I'd like think that genetics has something to do with that, but I
also know that my diet contains more proteins, fats, and vitamins than my
previous generation's diet did. The better the food you eat, the healthier you
are, as far as dieticians are concerned. Granted, heart disease and other
things can also be linked to richer diets....

Consider also that the N'luss are a warrior based society. If they were the
descendants of some military that turned to barbarism it would make give the
arguement of environment over engineering. Military doctrine, martial
techniques, and discipline shape and mold people. How many friends have you
had that went into the service and came back completely different, even more
different after they had been through real conflict? I can't really imagine
what it's like, but I have seen the effects of it enough to know that it does
change a person. So you get a group of very well developed people, with very
developed martial skills, making them somewhat akin to Waffen SS troopers.
What happens when discipline breaks down and raw survival is the only thing
holding a group together?

Perhaps the N'luss were something like MP's at the Plain of Towers. If the
world was going through the throws of the cataclysm, their military doctrine
would give them some kind of stability. If any central authority was left,
martial law could have been established as a means of keeping a society going.
I imagine the N'luss acted not to dissimilarly to some of the Japanese
soldiers who were still holed up twenty years after World War Two. The
machines fail, food runs short, riots occur, the Ssu and Hlyss make raids, the
N'luss step in to take control of the situation, and then realize that they
can take and have whatever they want. Now granted this doesn't happen
overnight, but it certainly is a possibility for their origins. Just some
conjecture on my part.

Sincerely,
Dwight

I agree and am flattered by the attention that my thought on this has 
recieved. 
Okay, so I don't really game anymore. 
I guess I have "outgrown" it. 
(Well, never say never.... If the right group of people were to come along
I might be talked into a game, but the truth is I would rather just sit
around and discuss Tekumel over a coffee or a beer or, if my friend Lewis
the wine buff were around, a fine wine. 

Perhaps we can think together of a more "mature" thing to do with the
Tekumel world creation than RPGs. 
I have no suggestions, by the way. 
But I would love to hear if anyone has any thoughts on this matter as to
what us "post-gamers" can do with our Tekumel interests. 

In the meantime, keep posting, please. 
Maybe internet discussions are the thing that us "post-gamers" should be
doing.

Peace everyone.

[Moderator's Note:  Geoffrey McVey adds to the beginning ref discussion.   ]
[                   I add my comments to this message at the end.          ]

In light of the recent conversation on how to begin a Tekumel campaign, I
thought that I might take a moment to add a few of my own comments.  These
are the observations of someone who has only recently become familiar with
the setting, but who, I hope, knows enough about games in general to be of
some use.

On Sun, 5 Jul 1998, James Maliszewski wrote:

This is good advice for any game, to prevent it from collapsing under the
weight of its creator's ambitions.  However, Tekumel has its own
characteristics which can -- and should -- give those people playing in
the setting reason to be uncomfortable.  I am not referring to issues of
language, which seem to be a stumbling block for some people; anyone who
has run a lengthy campaign in an otherworldly setting will have discovered
that dedicated players will adapt to new words and names eventually (and
willingly).  What concerns me more in Tekumel is what strikes me as a
remarkably immature attitude towards women and sexuality in general.

There are probably those would answer by telling me that Tekumel is a
fantasy world upon which it would be unfair (I am expecting the word
"politically correct" to turn up) to impose the standards of late 20th
century North America.  Those people are, unless I'm greatly mistaken
about the makeup of this list, largely North Americans living in the late
20th century.  Their standards are going to be present in the game whether
they wish it or not: it has become clear through the recent "poetic"
contributions to the list that there are certainly listmembers who have
brought the sexual fantasies of their culture's men along with them.  I
have found very little in the setting which would challenge those
assumptions in any way, which seems unusual for a world whose devotees
pride themselves on its uniqueness.

The examples I can provide can come only from what I have seen of the game
material as it has been published; if Tekumel as it is played is something
completely different from the way that it is presented in the books, I
would be pleased to hear it.  As I have said, however, the comments of
players on this list so far make it seem unlikely.  The women of Tekumel
are, in the vast majority of cases, presented as sexually manipulative or
predatory (Nayari of the Silken Thighs being the most obvious, and most
often repeated example, although I could draw out a few more if I had
books at hand) or as beautiful objects/decorations/toys (Keith Dalluhn
provides an excellent example with the wife of Sanjesh in message 762; her
"moonbeam" spell does not make her any less an object, but instead puts
her into the "look but don't touch" category so popular with male fans of
comic books).

While the former play the part of obstacles or villains and the latter the
part of rewards, both have their motivations and personalities constructed
around male fantasies of women rather than around women themselves.  I am
curious about the apparent exception to the rule, the Aridani: I would be
interested in some examples of how they are portrayed in the world, since
while I think I have read what I have with some care, I can find
relatively few Aridani personalities.  In any event, Aridani appear to be
the minority, and -- feel free to correct me -- largely the domain of
men wishing to play female characters.

The goddesses of Tekumel show a similar limit of scope: as my wife
commented when reading through the list of deities.  "Oh, I see: this
one's the goddess of sex and this one's the goddess of...  sex."  Making a
distinction between "fertility" and "hedonism" still basically defines
women solely around their ability to have sex, perpetuating an image which
our own culture seems not to have shaken off.  I am somewhat disappointed
that, tens of thousands of years from now in a world whose social
structure is completely different, so many things stay the same and so few
people appear to question it.

I would add an extra point to this piece of advice: remember that Tekumel
is a human setting.  While it has features of the fantastic, you will be
shortchanging your players if you offer them only shallow psychologies and
projected fantasies.  Most referees consider themselves above giving in to
their players' wishes for greater and greater rewards, more and more
outlandish treasures.  It would be a sign of some maturity if you could
resist the temptation of the setting by not offering them people (even
imaginary ones) as replacements for those treasures.

My (the moderator's) comments.
We have seen this topic before.  It seems that this mileau (ie Fantasy/SF role
playing) is dominated by young males.  As such, it quite often is presented in
a way that Geoffrey describes above.  

Let me give you assurances that it is not always that way.  In the short time
I have played in the Professor's Thursday night group I have met and experi-
enced many diverse situations.

The first experience I had playing I was almost abused by a company of Salarv-
yani soldiers.  I was male, by the way.  And I think the beards were too light
for the soldiers to have been Salarvyani female....  :)  Again that was a 
sexist joke, too.  Sorry!  I have to admit, it was embarassing.  But in the 
end, I think I would have been equally embarassed had I been a female.

The keep I was travelling to was run by an Aridani woman.  She was definitely 
"in charge" and efficient.

Let me clarify some issues as to the Gods.  Each God has many aspects.  There
are male and female aspects of each particular god (except maybe Dra and 
Dilinalia).  Check out Mitlanyal for more details (if you have a pre-release
copy).  I don't disagree that the overall picture of the gods are as you 
stated, however.  If you dig a bit deeper, there is more to the picture.

I am not saying that you are necessarily wrong.  I am saying that the building
blocks are there to build an instance of Tekumel that fits with your vision.
I am also saying that we see Tekumel as we see it.  If I am a young male I am
apt to see the typical comic book type Tekumel where men are hugely muscled,
women have massive helium breasts and curvy hips, and the streets are awash 
with beautiful people having lots of great sex...

However, knowing what I know (and looking at the rules for generating char-
acters), my vision of the people of Tekumel is quite close to the mix of 
people you see today.  Without the genetic variations of hair and eye colors.
I see tall, short, average, thin, fat and everything in between.  I see them
all mostly naked because of the oppresive climate conditions.  

Many people have complained about Tekumel material being sexist because of the
drawings.  That is more a 20th century American product.  Ask TOME if they
would have published a drawing that contained male anatomy in it.  My guess 
is they would not.  That is a here and now hangup.  Not a Tekumel hangup.

We have had this discussion before, and we'll likely have it again.  If you
have something new to offer, do so.  

Your point of this message is valid.  Tekumel should not be limited to 
20th century male dominated mentality.  The tools are there for it not 
to be.  It just takes our efforts to make sure that it doesn't happen.  
On the other hand, if someone wants their Tekumel to be that way, we have
to accept that, too.  I think that if you read the novels you'll get a 
good feel for "Real" Tekumel, and find that it is pretty much what you
expected, even if the goddesses seem sex related.  (I really don't think
of Avanthe as a goddess of sex - even though sex plays a part in some of
her rituals.)  But, if that is how you see it, I don't have any problem
living with that.  On the joke issue, we just have to be big enough to 
laugh at ourselves, too.  We just have to be flexible.

I have to admit, my ordeal with the Salarvyani was a bit embarrassing at
first.  I kind of took it personally.  When I shrugged off that baggage,
I didn't have a problem afterward.

My thoughts.

[Moderator's Note:  Peter Huston continues on the beginning ref question.]

Hey, I've got an idea! 

How about a big hole in the ground and you could fill it full of all kinds
of treasure.... 
Only there's a catch you see.... 
All this treasure.... 
They can't come and just take it, ya see.... 
Cause like it's all guarded by monsters, ya see.... 

And well like the characters have to fight the monsters to get it ya
know.... 
Only like don't really have 'em fight, cause if you do that then somebody
might get hurt and it'd probably be illegal.... 

I bet you could just like roll dice or something and the guy who gets the
highest number wins or something .... 

Sorry, I've been under stress lately. 
; -) 

Let me offer the following real suggestions. 
1) Familiarize yourself with the rules first. Try things out and see what
happens. 
2) Pre-roll the characters. 
3) Be very careful about just how much exotic stuff to insert. Put in some
but don't overload the players. 

Without some you might as well play D&D. With too much you will basically
be running the game yourself. 
"Okay guys, now here's the situation... It seems like you have many
options, but really on this world you only have one due to societal
pressures so what you all must do now is...." repeat many times ....
pretend the players are actually doing something....  

This is especially true if you don't know the players. 

Might I suggest a raid on something of some sort relating to the civil war?

Make it a Sarku something and it can be guarded by undead. 
They could be trying to steal some lost technology only to discover that it
doesn't work anyway (Tekumelani armies love to do things like lug broken
lightning bringers all around the country side just so everyone can see
that they have 'em and be scared while they pray -literally (by sacrificing
prisoners)- that no one finds out it's broken. (What a loss of
prestige!!!!) 

You could use some non-human player characters, perhaps even Ahoggya. 
Personally I would never allow an ahoggya as a PC in a campaign but in a
one off game why not? 
Or better yet use the Ahoggya as NPCs and they can do annoying things like
demand copper and rip off the legs of important prisoners in an untactful
way at inconvenient times. 
Use Pe Choi as PCs and make sure you show the characters the pictures. 

Most of the game would focus on "down-to-Earth" tactical problems, but
there would be enough exotica to keep the players aware that this aint the
usual D&D game. 

I'd avoid urban intrigue games with strangers in a one off game by all
means. 
Otherwise you could easily spend much too much time "dumping data" on the
players and stating things like "No, you can't do that. You can't "marry"
the beautiful slave girl. No Tsolyani would ever do that. It would result
in too much loss of prestige."  or similar statements. "But of course you
know that as this is a fourth circle priest of Durritmalish from Sokatis
that he couldn't possibly have stolen your prunes...."            


Let me offer a pair of non-Tekumel related experiences. 
1) Last campaign I tried to organize was the Talsorian Cyberpunk game. I'd
designed a detailed world setting, a dark and gloomy high tech Miami which
was sinking under the ocean from global warming. I loved doing this. The
players, much to my annoyance, preferred a more tactical style of play. 

Now these guys really would have been having just as much fun playing Squad
Leader (and that's cool in a way.) 
But I'd designed a high tech murder mystery and they were supposed to be
trying to understand their environment and solving mysteries. 

They just couldn't or wouldn't do it. 
They would approach NPCs who knew one clue and one clue only and then shoot
them when the NPCs would not tell them who the killer was. (The NPCs had no
idea at all By the way.) 

As I said, a very bad fit..... 
And I take as much of the blame as anyone.... 

 
2) Speaking of exotic games. 
Remember Traveller? Well Traveller has an alien race called the K'Kree
(sometimes called Centaurs) 
The K'Kree are militant vegetarians who travel in large herds. 
Traveller had once put out a supplement where the players could be a K'kree
herd. 
I invited some people over. I said in advance, "This is not a normal game.
You will all be aliens. You will be expected to be aliens and act like
aliens." 
Okay cool they said. I figured that had clinched it. 

Then when they arrived they began looking things over and said, "Cows! You
expect us to be cows!!!" 

Well its been ten years and a friend of mine just the other day said, "Oh
yeah, I remember that one night that you wanted us to be cows!!! Hah... I
guess it's good you gave up gaming, har har...." 

ooooooooooooooooohhhhhhhh!!!!!
In this case I refuse to take the blame as I insist I warned the players in
advance what to expect and they refused to even try it out (so why did they
come to visit anyway????)     

So go easy on the players. 
If you dump too much exotica on them, well they might not do to well and
you will all be dissapointed. 

Thass' my advice. 

The first EPT game I ever played was at a convention and it was a simple
dungeon crawl. 
I loved it!! 
You don't need to do too much on the first try.

[Moderator's Note:  Peter Huston offers some more original creatures.     ]

Ye Olde Tekumel Campaigne

First of all thanks to James Malikewski for all the attention and flattery.

It was great to see MY gaming related stuff on his website. I never
realized how much it meant until I saw it there. Anyway, as they say,
flattery will get you everything so here goes another installment. (Now,
James, my friend, perhaps its enough to describe my crude fiction as
"unpublished" and leave out the harsh but true "rejected" part.) 

: -) 

Anyway, .. 

First we have a pair of unnamed creatures that exist only in the Mihalli
ruins. 

Creature Number One. 

Another weird plant and quite immobile.  
Physically this looks like a large "puff ball", with a single stem sticking
up in the middle with a few small flowery things fluffing out on the top of
the stem. 

It has a large network of roots spread out all along the surface in many
directions along the surface of the rocky surfaces of the bombed Mihallli
slag heaps where it thrives. At times these are hidden under the other
vegetation and grasses of the area. 

The creature has a unique and terrible means of spreading its seeds. Not
only do these roots serve the conventional purpose of obtaining nutrients
and such for the main body of the plant, but they all serve as triggering
devices. In other words, when a wandering animal, creature or, hint hint,
adventurer, comes traipsing along and steps on one the puffball will
explode. My notes state that there is a 2/3 chance that someone will step
on a root when they are within the radius of the roots (at least a meter,
maybe two.)  

Tiny seeds will fly in all directions in a vast fluffy cloud. (Something
like those milkweed seeds that would have the little "parachutes" on them
but much smaller say about a fifth of the size.) As the passerbys suddenly
find themselves engulfed in these clouds, unless they have taken
precautions of some kind, then they are quite likely to inhale some seeds.
Unfortunately, these seeds are looking for a nice, warn, wet, dark place to
germinate. So expect them to sprout in about 2-12 days or so.  Expect the
affected victims to be forced into immobility but to be able to last a bit
before they die.  This will allow the rest of the party to have to lug them
around for  a week or tow and seek special medical attention and such.
(Perhaps a possible source of such medical aid might be those rumored
underground Mihalli settlements which your PCs now have to go and visit
first hand, an unlikely proposition, but how else are you going to save
poor little Horuk? * Remember, don't kill characters right away. Torture
them first. But do give them a chance to survive the torments you inflict
on them.) 

It seems likely that this plant might have certain times of the year when
it is "in seed". This time of the year should be whenever the players
happen to visit the Mihalli ruins. 

; -) 

Also it seems likely that the native tribespeople  might wear bandannas
over their mouths.  Of course, the haughty folk of the Five Empires would
never emulate such uncivilized behavior. They'd laugh at the backwards
barbarians with their ridiculous clothing. 


Creature Number Two. 

Another Special from the Mihalli ruins, and, not a plant!!!   

This is another nasty thing. 

It lays crystaline eggs of a beautiful and jewel like appearance. 
The ignorant folk of the Five Empires will surely find such "jewels" to be
of great potential value. 
If they take them home they may have a problem. 
Seems that if they do something to carry the "jewels" next to their skin
then the jewels will hatch and the little beasties inside will jump out and
burrow into their nice warm flesh. 
Ouch! Lose a hit point or two. 

Well, now you've got three more problems. 
First, is how do you get the little things out. 
Second, what about when they start to grow. 
Third, the mama creature is gonna start following you around through a
telepathic link. 
This link may be considered completely unbreakable. 
Unless you have some truly monstrous sorcery of some kind. 
She wishes to make sure that the things hatch.    

Mama creature is as follows: 
Two large red eyes, 
Six limbs, walks on four, the others are specialized claws with a large
dagger like thumb. 
About the same number of hits as a large strong man. 
Leathery skin. 
It moves about 120% of man's normal speed. 
Sees in the dark just like it was day. 
Carnivorous. 
And. never sleeps. 
Mostly it just stalks whatever its eggs have been hatched into. 
Its always there, just over the next hill, waiting to be seen.  
  
If the characters are doing something that endangers the eggs, then it will
attack. 
If the characters are doing something reckless and foolhardy, like entering
the underworld or spending too much time in ruins or engaging in strange
sorcerous practices that even an animal can tell are not normal, then it
will attack and thus ensure that its eggs get laid and hatch in a nice warm
corpse.

[Moderator's Note:  Kevin King shares the results of the responses to his ]
[                   message about beginning refs.                         ]

I'd like to thank James Maliszewski, Bob Dushay, and Keith Dalluhn for their
comments and advice.  I have decided to take a little from each of you.  The
gods will play a role, as James suggested, and I have decided to add a touch
of politics.  When William and Mary contended for the throne with the Catholic
heir to the Stuarts, Colonists in the Americas saw it as an excuse to rid
themselves of troublesome authorities.  When the Crown reorganized, the
Colonists claimed they had acted in the interests of the Glorious Revolution
back home.  I have a feeling human nature remains consistent, even across
dimensional rifts, and minor nobles on the periphery might use the instability
back home as a pretext to advance their interests.

The factions will divide between Ksarul and Sarku, though disciples of the
Inner Mysteries or Devotees of the Worm Lord from other regions might look
askance at the local interpretation of these Deities' objectives.
Nevertheless, the gods can't be too picky as they do seem to interact with
humans, and will manifest their interests despite mortal lack of comprehension
of the same.  Their agents in this scenario will be an aged priest named
Mizhotl hi'Soruna of clan Dark Water and Firu hi'Kutonyal of Scarlet Sail.
They will be on the edge of events at first, but may appear later at crucial
moments and attempt to turn events in either Sarku or Ksarul's favor,
respectively.

The setting is the island of Te'chune which is located on the northern edge
of the Chanayaga Deeps, in the waters south of Ganga.  It is about 60 miles
across with one small city that fancies itself Tsolyani.  The island has one
ill-tended Sakbe road leading north into the sea and south toward a partially
submerged ruin.  The road is used primarily as a wall separating the farming
communities of the west from the highland jungles of the east and their
ignoble inhabitants.  

The recent instability in the capitol and its local counterpart has stirred
archaeological interest in the ruined city to the south.  Though its deeper
levels are submerged, clan Rising Sun has discovered a site in the highlands
just to the east of unknown antiquity.  Just as the expedition penetrated a
new level it was attacked.  Most were killed, including all of high birth.
The clan elders believe the island's tribals to be responsible and have hired
the pc's to investigate discretely both the incident and the site itself.  

Though I'm not going to use Keith's character as an npc (thanks for the
offer) I am going to use a noble who is similar.  His name is Tsodlan
hi'Chankolu of Rising Sun and is largely responsible for his clan's local
affiliation with Ksarul.  He is a true believer though he has no clue about
the Inner Mysteries.  An independent thinker with high intelligence, he would
have gone far in the empire if his family obligations had permitted him to
leave the island.  

Instead, he has developed a philosophical system inspired by some partial
writings he found exploring the ruins to the south as a youth (many years ago)
and interpreted for him by a priest of Ksarul.  His interpretations are
internally consistent but have borrowed many local beliefs and contain
outdated perspectives derived from the scrolls he discovered.  As a
consequence, any outsider witnessing a ceremony at the Temple of Ksarul his
clan helped build, might be tempted to interpret it as evidence of heresy.

Tsodlan knows more about the ruins than he is letting on, and it wasn't mere
chance that his clan discovered this site.  He is also emotionally involved in
events as one son and two granddaughters of Tsodlan were killed in the attack.
He believes a Temple of Ksarul may lie buried below containing a repository of
artifacts, tomes, and miscellany that will aid his clan in their competition
with Dark Water.  It is vital to him that these items be recovered if they
exist as Dark Water has outmaneuvered him politically and an attack may be
imminent. 

Well, that's the adventure.  I hope it's Tsolyani enough because I'll be
representing the professors game at this con, though obviously a personal
interpretation of it.  Any comments will be welcome.

[                   please chime in, and anyone else can feel free, too.     ]

In IMJ II 1 (Fall 2358 A.S.) there is a reference to a map series for the
Pass of Skulls, complementing the Northwest Frontier set.  Does this exist,
perhaps in remnants that could be released to the FTP site?

How about an update on the release schedule for Mitlanyal?

Now for a "real" question:

Northwest Frontier, Hex 4604, the Temple of Jneksha'a: This is a combined
temple and monastery to Jneksha'a, one of the demons of Lord Vimuhla.  It
is still held by the Tsolyani, although the Mu'ugalavyani have laid seige
to it several times since 2360. [c.2358 A.S.]

My question is, what would be the likely fate of this or any other such
temple or monastery were it to be taken over by the Mu'ugalavyani?  Would
the religious icons, statues, and trappings be thrown down, would the
Mu'ugalavyani send their own priests of Vimuhla to take up residence, or
would current ascetics perhaps be allowed to continue on?  Would Tsolyani
inscriptions be rubbed out and replaced with similar passages in
Mu'ugalavyani?  Etc.

In a broader context, what happens when military or political actions
overflow religious institutions?  Since the tenants of Pavar's thought and
iconography are somewhat cross-cultural, are there particular cases of
continuity of worship or devotions even in the face of repeated shifts of
"secular" allegiance?

[Moderator's Note:  Kevin King reports how his con session went.         ]

Hexicon 8 went off as planned and I was able to run E.P.T.  Only one
person signed up for the scenario ahead of time, which had me worried, but
three actually ended up playing.  Of those who played, two had tried it
before.  Everyone, including the new person, enjoyed the game.  It's too bad
others didn't have the courage to try it, as a larger party was what I had
intended and some of the encounters were a bit tight.  The experienced players
reacted nicely to the fresh scent of cinnamon that greeted them as they
entered the subterranean layers of the ruin.  Perhaps I'll run it again for
Hexicon 9 with a few more players.

[Moderator's Note:  James Maliszewski clarifies information on his Sanjesh.  ]

The Sanjesh we dealt with in Khirgar was of the Vraisu lineage, a relation
of Artukka, the clanmaster of Golden Dawn clan. The clan-girl Sanjesh was to
marry was named Dletana hiViriktani, a young and talented woman nevertheless
without prospects of marriage to someone of a higher clan. Of course, there
are those in Khirgar who suggested that Golden Sunburst gained as much from
this marriage as did the mid-ranked Golden Dawn, namely access to a trading
network to sell the undistinguished wines that are the personal project of
its clanmaster, Mirgan hiDolumesa.

Do you know any of these people?

[Moderator's Note:  James Maliszewski seeks confirmation of a rumor.    ]

I have received a report from a group of Khirgari adventurers currently
operating out of Khirgar that they have uncovered a subterranean "farm" of
the Food of the Ssu in a cavern complex beneath the fens of Komore. This
farm seems to have been deliberately cultivated by unknown persons for
unknown purposes. There was likewise evidence of harvesting the Food,
although there were no signs of either the harvesters or the diabolical
"farmers" who maintained it all.

Has anyone else ever encountered such an unusual phenomena? If so, why would
anyone purposely grow the Food given all of the risks involved?

[Moderator's Note:  Charlie Goering asks about Maps, and other topics.  The]
[                   Professor replies.                                     ]

>1. With the hand-drawn maps used by traders, is there a convention as to
>how the map is to be oriented, north to the top for example? Also, do
>such maps have a scale referenced on them or is distance given in travel
>time from point A to point B?

Many merchant clans use "maps" that consist of lines (roads/routes) and
circles/squares (towns and cities). These connect to some major supply
city. Usually these maps show just one "route": city A to city X, passing
through various intermediate towns,etc. There is no scale; The map is
usually oriented north-south, with the ""top" to the north, but I have seen
examples oriented south-north: e.g. Bey Su down to Jakalla, with Jakalla at
the top. The travel times from town/city to town/city are often inscribed
in some convenient place on the map. Have a look at Arab mediaeval maps for
a comparison.

If a "better" map is wanted, the Tsolyani draw a picture: a stylised
portrayal of a town, etc., with figures of its residents drawn in here and
there; cf. the box cover of the original EPT. As far as I know, there are
no maps (either like ours or theirs) of "scenery": i.e. a "map" of a
seacoast or mountain range that is made just to display terrain. The
Tsolyani merchant clans require line/circle maps for economic purposes and
do not decorate them much. The "picture maps" are for upper class clansmen
who want to "see" what a given city looks like and who lives where in it.

Many clans also keep their trade routes and useful information secret,
using code to write the inscriptions, inserting fake obstacles, cities,
etc. and not indicating travel times. A merchant's map is thus a valuable
commodity. Stealing one is not a good idea.

>2. Are the squirming runes found on the emblem of the Goddess of the Pale
>Bone, She Who Is Not To Be Named, a language used by her followers or
>just abstract symbols?

They are said to be "sorcerous," with innate magical powers. Nobody seems
to know just what these powers are or how to make them work. Somebody who
knows Sunuz may be able to help -- but, then, who wants to activate these
terrible runes anyway?

>3. Are the titles of Grand Adept and High Princeps interchangeable? Lord
>Gamalu hiBeshyene has been called the High Princeps in some articles, is
>he also the Grand Adept of the Temple of Lord Thumis?

They are technically different: "Grand Adept" is a magical/religious title
for the seniormost priest/sorcerer in the hierarchy, while "High Princeps"
denotes the highest official of the temple council, more of an
administrative title. In the temple of Thumis Lord Gamulu hiBeshyene holds
both posts. Some temples try to keep them separate; others lump them into
one.

>4. Does the Temple of Thumis in Paya Gupa have an official name like the
>Temple of Eternal Knowing in Bey Su? Is there only one Temple to each God
>in a city such as Chene Ho, or is there one main Temple and other
>"neighborhood" Temples?

The great Thumis temple in Paya Gupa is titled "The Pearl Grey Spire." It
is truly a marvel. There is usually a "primary" temple in each
district/province of the land, with smaller temples to the same deity in
the cities and towns around, rather like cathedrals, basilicas, and
neighbourhood churches. All of these are administratively under the
authority of the main temple. Thus, Lord Gamulu "commands" his temple in
Paya Gupa directly and has authority also over the clergy of other Thumis
temples in his city and district, with last-resort powers over Thumis
temples elsewhere. The structure is complex; variables include rank, temple
size, religious importance, economic importance, tradition, and history.
Some very small temples and monasteries are thus considered of higher
"rank" than the mighty edifices in one of the major cities.

>5. Could you provide some idea on the terms of address used in the
>military? I would assume that higher officers would be called "My Lord"
>by subordinates, but how would lower ranking officers address each other
>and how would other ranks address junior officers?

Address is by title: "Kasi" ("Captain"), "Molkar" ("Major" -- more or
less), "Dritlan" ("Colonel" -- more or less), "Kerdu" ("General"), etc.
These can each have the honorific endings "-koi" and on occasion other
honorifics: e.g. "Kerdudalisakoi" ("Great and powerful General").

There is no "my lord," which smacks of Renaissance Europe -- unless the
addressee really does hold one of the ancient Engsvanyali or Bednalljan
noble titles: i.e. "Mringukoi" "Arsekmekoi." or "Hehellukoi." If one does
not choose to use one of the special 2nd person pronouns given in the
Grammar, one can just say "Tusmidalikoi" ("you honorific") and address a
stranger as "Horokoi" ("Sir, Gentleman") A lady is similarly addressed as
"Hororakoi."
