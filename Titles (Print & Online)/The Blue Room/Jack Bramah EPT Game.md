Jack Bramah EPT Game
# The Blue Room Vol9#250 
Jack Bramah offers some tails of the London Thursday night campaigns.

In sorting out the chaos of moving house I found some old diaries which occasionally contained snippets of the then current Thursday night London game. I'll try and piece them together in a coherent fashion with background detail (what I can remember).

The players were (initially): 
- Myself Chaideshu hiSsanmirin Sea Blue Ka Former hereksa in Serqu Sword of the Empire. Also has a smattering of sorcery, only used when otherwise unarmed.
- Steve F Kanmi'yel hiBashlatoi Standing Stone Vi. Sorceror Priest. Hates Jadhak and Tlangten.
- Jamie T Jadhak hiVriddi. Vriddi. Ct. Sorceror Priest of Chiteng. Enjoys his work. Unable to keep money.
- Min S Tlangten hiSsanyusa. Standing Stone. Vi. Thrown out of Red Devastation for being too psychotic. Hates Kanmi'yel 
- Rob D Baluri hiThanu Sword of Fire. Vi. Arrogant. Hates Kanmi'yel (See old issues of Imperial Courier for details of their extensive litigations)
- Dave B Emra hiGangasa. Might of Ganga. Be. Thin twin brother of Yaliemra. Sorceror
- Mark W Yaliemra hi Gangasa. Might of Ganga. Qo. Se Above 
- Olly J Ssomu hi???.???. ???. Strong warrior, not exceptionally endowed with brains. Ally of Baluri 
- Dave M Kashu hiVorodu. ??.Vi. Sorceror Priest. In with, if not actually a member opf the Incandescent Blaze society 

7th Halir

We went down into the tsu'urum into the Llyani levels, and found all sorts of strange and useless devices of the Ancients. The flashing lights looked pretty. We fought replicas of ourselves. I suspect that means our old enemy Kolontal is back. We eventually discovered a Learning Sphere which taught me Llyani Mathematics, though what practical use that is I can't imagine. Ssomu didn't agree with the division of the spoils and insulted the Clan. I demanded satisfaction in the hirilakte. I won. When will my companions learn that I *always* win in the arena when my honour is impugned?
We left the arena to discover that there are other duplicates of ourselves running around the town. Baluri's secretary has been murdered and replaced by a simulacrum of some sort.

16th Halir
Entered a tomb of one of the Ssirandars and got ambushed by a crowd of those backstabbers from the Ndalu Society. They left us alive, but took everything else. Fortunately after that we found the main tomb, and managed to re-equip ourselves. I found the amulet of the Good God I've been searching for all this time, and what appears to be the Hammer of Pendarte. Unfortunately those cost me most of my share.

17th Halir
We have received a challenge from the cowards who ambushed us.
They wish to fight a fair contest between the two groups - winner takes all. Everyone seems to be in favour, assuming that we can go down to the combat ground in the underworld and set up a few safety devices as contingencies against the treacherous behaviour they are bound to use.

23rd Halir
**The Duel**. We went down two days ago to set up focus points for Departing in Safety. Who should turn up for the duel but Kolontal - two of him in fact, accompanied by two ru'un. Discretion was thought to be the better part of valour, so we decided to use the Eye of Departing in Safety. Unfortunately it left Emra and myself behind to face the two ru'un (Kolontal went after the others). Emra was hit by the Excellent Ruby Eye, which left me to face certain death at the hands of the ancient automata. I sang my death song, and fired up a Blade of Inexorable Disjection and went to my glorious death, sure of a place in the Legions of the Lord of Battle. Fortunately one of them turned away and headed after the others, and with the Scarlet Lord guiding my blade I cut down the Bronze Demon.

# The Blue Room Vol9#255 25th Halir
Thank you Ssirandar. Now I can afford a coming-of-age banquet for my son that Jakalla will remember for years to come.
26th Halir
I have been thinking about the guest list. I suppose I should invite the Governor, and I'll send a tentative invitation to Uncle Chaimira, though I doubt the pressures of his duties at Avanthar will allow him to be present. I'd better consult the Clan elders for the people that the Clan wants to invite. With any luck the fact that dress will be the 16th Form might keep Tlangten and Ssomu away. Companions that they are I can't risk their lack of breeding reflecting badly on the Clan if they make some horrendous gaffe.
1st Trantor
The clanhouse is in complete chaos. Word has just been received that the High Provost of the Chancery will be in the province on official business next week, and he intends to honour us, and me with his presence at my son's banquet. This will really make it a night to remember!
4th Trantor
Three days to go. The High Provost is due tomorrow, and there will be a welcoming banquet in his honour. At least I shall get the chance to wear the 19th Form. In fact it will probably be required for my son's banquet too.
5th Trantor (late)
My head is in a spin. Perhaps I should not have indulged in that strange white paste after that much ngalu. I seem to be having very strange dreams. I have just seen a vision - it was this rather than a dream, since it felt so real, and I don't think I was asleep. I saw Kanmi'yel or his soul at any rate, crossing over a black bridge to an island where Missum is standing at a lectern draped in yellow cloth, with a huge book perched in it, into which he is writing the names of other souls crossing the bridge. When Kanmi'yel reaches him he puts down the pen and does not write a name in the book. I wish I knew what that meant.
7th Trantor
More panic in the clanhouse. It seems that both Prince Rereshqala and the Princess Ma'in will be attending the banquet. This must surely be auspicious for my son. When has there been a naming banquet for someone not of the Tlakotani where two Imperial heirs are present? I must say that I was not this nervous when we were waiting for the order to scale the walls of Ke'er. It will be glorious if everything goes well this evening, but I will never be able to show my face in Jakalla again if anything goes wrong.
7th Trantor (later)
My son has chosen the name Tekutan. I hope that some of the spirit of that Tekutan hiSsanmirin who commanded the garrison of Chene Ho in the War of 2020.
Unbelievably both Tlangten and Ssomu attended and were models of respectable behaviour, not putting a foot wrong all evening.
The food was exquisite and the entertainments unsurpassed. Tekutan was bewitched by the Lady Zuara hiTlakotani, a niece of Rereshqala. I have heard that her tastes run to men of lower social background. One or two of the Noble Clans of Jakalla have had their noses put out of joint by being "requested" to induct commoners into their ranks.
# The Blue Room Vol9#264 10th Trantor
Kanmi'yel is dead again, or so it seems. Jadhak and I have our doubts.
A N'lyss called Mruft Sroso tried to kill Jadhak today, apparently under the influence of Domination. Strangely the assailant's left eye is clouding over a bit like Kanmi'yel's did after the incident with Nyelmu and the sra'ur of Lelmiyani.
11th Trantor
Kanmi'yel, it seems, immolated himself in the Sacrificial Flame at the Temple of Vimuhla. Why he should choose this particularly devout form of suicide is a mystery to me, as he has never been that fervently religious.
12th Trantor
I overheard Jadhak talking to Tlangten - *He* killed him, or at least had him killed by some of his hired thugs. He dominated him and then had him killed at Kashu's house. Jadhak is now really worried, because he had a Transmogrification cast to try and contact Kanmi'yel's spirit. He failed to find it either in the Unending Grey or on the way to the Isles of the Excellent Dead. That menas that either he's still alive or in the Halls of Burning Victory (or whatever the Flame paradise is called).
13th Trantor
We now think that Kanmi'yel's soul is inhabiting the body of Mruft Sroso, who we have recently found out was employed by Kolontal. I can't believe that Kanmi'yel would have anything voluntarily to do with our arch-enemy. Jadhak is now working out a way of killing Kanmi'yel off permanently. Personally I don't care as long as a corollary is the death of Kolontal. He's one thorn in my side I could well do without.
17th Trantor
I don't know what happened to Jadhak's plan, but Kanmi'yel is back looking like himself again, and we're heading north to try and thwart the plans of the vile traitor Baron Ald.
1st Hasanpor
Because of Jadhak's dithering in Purdimal about buying some weird ingredients for one of his bizarre rituals we almost got stranded in the middle of nowhere for the intercalary days. We travelled non-stop for the last two days. It cost us a fortune in palanquins and bearers.
The rest of us have persuaded Jadhak to cough up for it as it was his fault. Not that it's his money anyway - he's borrowing off me again, or at least borrowing off my funds which are managed by the major-domo. I understand that Ma'ashte made him put the Palace of the Moon up as security against the loan. One part of me would be quite keen for him to default on the loan, as the Palace is worth ten times as much as the loan, but I'm not sure I'd want it, given the strange goings-on that always seem to occur there. Probably something to do with the fact that there used to be a Pariah temple underneath. There's probably a lingering taint even if it has been completely filled in and purged by all the relevant priesthoods.
Anyway we made it to Khirgar in time for the intercalary days.
Not exactly my favourite place in the Empire, but still better than some village in a field. The city is teeming with troops. Tlangten has found some of his old legion buddies, so he's off remembering old times with them.
2nd Hasanpor
I bumped into Sergeant Heshqo this morning. He used to be my senior NCO. He was invalided out after losing his right hand in a Qadarni. At least he isn't reduced to beggary, as he seems to have held on to quite a lot of the loot we got from Ke'er. It can't be much fun though for a soldier who knows nothing else, but can't fight.
4th Hasanpor
We've received some sort of orders. I'm not sure quite where they come from, but Kashu and Jadhak seem to be the most informed, so I suspect there may be a hint of Incandescent Blaze somewhere.
We're to find some sort of secret Yan Koryani fortress to the north of the Atkolel Heights, and find out what's going on there.
15th Hasanpor
We've been struggling through a swamp for the last couple of days, beset by the usual denizens - Tsoggu etc.
Razhim turned out to be some sort of automaton, no doubt sent by Kolontal, who cut down Baluri and Tlangten before we could stop him.
16th Hasanpor
We arrived at the "fortress" and discovered two black pyramids covered in glyphs of Tkel. It's a good job we had Jadhak with us, who got us past using the correct formulae of dismissal.
The place is something to do with the Weapon Without Answer, and we found Fu Shi'i, who we killed by setting light to him - or so we thought. No sooner had we turned our backs when he was up again and sent eaters of Souls at us, which kept us busy while he made good his escape.
18th Hasanpor
The archaeologists will have fun in the centuries to come when they find the wreckage of a ship atop a mountain in the Atkolel Heights.
A ship with a lot of Yan Koryani bodies underneath it.
I'll explain: we were using Aeriality to speed our journey back to Khirgar when we came across a unit of the Legion of the Dancer Without Eyes being attacked by a larger force of Yan Koryani. Our sorcerers had expended most of their energies so the only recourse to rescue these gallant troops was to improvise by withdrawing our merchant ship from within the Chest of the Topaz God and allowing it to fall on the attackers. What a waste of a ship. Still, we should appear in a few Ahoggya legends soon.
# The Blue Room Vol9#269 12th Langala
Back to Jakalla finally. We had an uneventful trip (for us).
We went via Bey Su, and escorted a shipment of books for the Temple of Chiteng in Jakalla. We were forced to dawdle by the fact that Jadhak insisted on reading them all before we got to Jakalla.
21st Langala
I got a call at the clanhouse from a representative of the governor of Chame'el. It seems his brother was captured by pirates off Dlantla Isle. There has been no ransom demand, so he suspects that he has been killed, but whatever, he would like us to retrieve the body. I have no idea why he has approached us, but it would be pleasant to have a sea voyage at this time of year.
22nd Langala
We all went to a party at the Palace of the Moon, and a gang of bandits attacked the house during dinner. We managed to escape, though Emra, Ssomu and I had our pedhetl drained, leaving us with the willpower of mrur. Kashu went to the Omnipotent Azure Legion, who weren't interested 23rd Langala
We went back up to the Palace to confront the bandits, Emra Ssomu and I still somewhat zombified.
The leader was this guy with crystal hands. He revealed to us that he had been a slave that Kashu had mutilated whilst trying to test the effect of a couple of "Eyes" we had found. All he wants to do is to get revenge on Kashu and become Emperor.
Pretty reasonable requests for a slave really. In true Kashu style, he just killed the slave, Nuriyade, and pushed us into this strange cabinet device to escape from the rest of the bandits.
Once in the cabinet our awareness returned, and we found ourselves transportd to various places. I appeared with Kashu on a narrow icy ledge on a vast cliff face. There was a cave behind us. We were attacked by ice demons which we dealt with, and entered the cave. We were in an ice maze, and encountered another three demons; I slew two with a single blow. We found our way out of the maze and came to a chamber where there was an ice block with what appeared to be me inside. I struck it with the Hammer and it shattered, and we found ourselves back in the Palace of the Moon, with the others.
The rest of the bandits had fled when the cabinet started making strange and terrifying noises. The cabinet is now a smoking wreck.
# The Blue Room Vol10#272 The Ice Temple which they visited is far north of Ghaton on the shores of the northern sea. I think it used to be on the old TSR map, but it was too far south, and so we took it off. Interesting that they should be transported there.
Part 6
28th Langala
Finally off to Salarvya. The ship seems sound enough, and the crew regularly ply the route between Jakalla and Chame'el.
3rd Fesru
The weather is unbearably hot. Even the breeze isn't cooling us down.
4th Fesru
Fog. The gods know where it came from. The captain can't understand it, and the temperature has dropped. It feels like winter out there. We're almost reduced to huddling together for warmth below decks.
5th Fesru
We ran aground on a sandbank. The captain claims that the island isn't known to him. He thinks that we'll be able to float of the sandbank at high tide, but he'll only go out and anchor offshore until the fog drifts. The rest of us have decided to explore the island, and see whether we can find any game for the pot.
We found a cave in the side of a hill, and went in. It opened up into a big cavern inside. Jadhak spotted a glyph of Maraggu carved into the wall. We found the place defended by three demon Champions - those of Maraggu, Ku'eth and Hrgash, which we defeated eventually. We managed to find a fair bit of loot, all of which Tlangten wants to keep for himself.
6th Fesru
The fog is gone, and there is no sign of the island. We should be in Chame'el in about a week if the weather holds out.
17th Fesru
Met the Governor of Chame'el. He wants us to retrieve his brother, dead or alive. And he claims that there is a curse on Dlantla Isle which can only be lifted by the intervention of a foreigner.
30th Fesru
We found that the curse was due to some demon or other called the Dead Spirit Lord, who was imprisoning an Aspect of Shiringgayi (don't ask me to explain the theology of it all).
We destroyed the dead Spirit Lord, and though several of us appeared to be killed in the battle, the released Aspect of Shiringgayi restored our dead to life through Her beneficence, and granted us each one wish.
The others wished for the ability to cast such and such a spell, or some wealth or other such greedy desires. I asked for the gift of fertility, though what that will entail is a mystery to me at the moment. [He was unaware of it before he died, but the apparent effect was that every woman he slept with at the right stage in her cycle became pregnant, whether or not lisutl root was used, and they eventually gave birth to almost identical, exquisitely beautiful daughters, often in multiple births.]
3rd Drenggar
We finally found the pirate base and wiped them out. It turned out that the Governor's brother was the leader of the pirates. We killed him, but he came back as a giant and we had difficulty killing him again. I suppose we need to go back via Chame'el and give the Governor the bad news. I hope he takes it well. I have no desire to find myself viewing the inside of a Salarvyani jail, or feel the ministrations of the Salarvyani equivalent of the Company of the Edification of the Soul!
# The Blue Room Vol10#278 6th Drenggar
Back home at last. The Governor was fairly reasonable about everything. He just made us swear not to reveal to anyone who the pirate chief had been.
7th Drenggar
We've been joined on board by three priestesses of Hrihayal.
Jadhak seems keen to discuss some of the doctrinal connections between Chiteng and Hrihayal. Whether this involves practical application I don't know.
8th Drenggar
A strange ship met us on the seas, crewed by complete foreigners. Nobody understood their language, though Kanmi'yel thought their writing looked a bit like Llyani. They seemed to have some pact of defence with the Three Demon Brothers. We barely escaped with our lives and the ship intact.
10th Drenggar
We are cursed! Are we never going to get back home? As a result of Jadhak's "close doctrinal discussions" he managed to find that the priestesses are not priestesses of Hrihayal at all! Unfortunately before we could do anything about this they attacked us. It seems that they are the Ksarul priestesses of last year returned from the dead to haunt us.
They hit us with some spell that drew us into a nexus point, they were obviously hoping to cast us into the sea at some distance from the ship, where we would drown.
By chance, or by the blessings of the gods we found ourselves under the sea within a metal chamber. We found some "Eyes" hidden in the chamber. Tests would indicate that at least two are Eyes of Aerial Excellence. This means that if we should be able to get out of the chamber we can at least follow the ship and get our revenge, as the priestesses must surely believe us to be dead.
11th Drenggar
With a certain ampount of tinkering the chamber has risen to the surface and we are starting our pursuit.
(Later) We caught up with the ship and were fighting well, even when the priestesses called upon the aid of Lord O@*&%b. Baluri, Tlangten and I fought the demon while Jadhak and Kanmi'yel dealt with the sorceresses.
At this point Ssomu took leave of his senses and decided that since the primary magic was not working, a bit of secondary was in order (This from a warrior with the brains of a chlen). We were unfortunate that he had a magic sword which could bring forth the Carpet of Conflagration. This he cast upon the deck of the ship, which, needless to say, caught fire in a spectacular fashion, and sank, taking the priestesses and the surviving crew with it. We were fortunate to be able to fly off the deck. However, we were left hundresds of miles from land with no vessel floating above the ocean.
We decided to fly back to the metal chamber, and hope it was still afloat.
12th Drenggar
We are aboard the chamber. There is nothing to do but wait until a ship passes by to rescue us. Fortunately we seem to be well supplied (both naturally and magically).
15th Drenggar
Just as we thought the food was so boring that we'd prefer to die rather than be subjected to Nutrifaction rations again a ship appeared. Our spirits soared. Until it turned out to be a ship crewed by Ahoggya. Rations would be preferable to that!
Thanks to my tact and diplomacy (Jadhak and Tlangten have the opposite) we hitched a ride from them, and for a small consideration decided to take their cargo to Jakalla rather than Chame'el. Ssomu was prevailed upon to supply the required inducements, since it was his stupid fault we were stuck here anyway. When we get home I'll need to spend at least a week in the bath.
