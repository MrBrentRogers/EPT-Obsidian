What is this all about, anyway?

This series of books are the adventures of the original Thursday night gaming group of Prof. M. A. R. Barker, over some fifteen years of gaming. The text is taken from the logbooks and audio recordings made during those game sessions, with additional enlightenment from the Professor as thought needed for the education of the reader.

Why should I take the time to read this?

You might be able to learn something about the way the Professor viewed his creation, and how he liked to present it to the group. You might also find a few nuggets of information that you might be able to use in your own games set in his world.

How can I get a copy?

We'll be setting up a dedicated website for the book; watch this group for announcements.

We'll add to this FAQ page as time goes on…
