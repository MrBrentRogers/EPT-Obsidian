Newcomers reminder:

First of all, to eliminate Spam from the list, all new members are moderated until their first post. If the first post is relevant to Tekumel, then the new member will become unmoderated.

I just want to remind all the newcomers that there are some extras on the
Tekumel Yahoo! Group.

I've put up the Tekumel FAQ, as well as various rules systems, in the Files section.

There's a poll in the Polls section: What system do you use for playing
Tekumel?

Some links have been added to the Links section.

The Database section has a table for finding games in your area.

And the Chat area is active.

This e-community is what you make of it, so participate.

If you send SPAM to the list, you will be immediately banned from the mailing list.
