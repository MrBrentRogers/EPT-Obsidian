Hi Victor,  
  
Here's my original post to the Tekumel mailing list (and I also used  
this as a basis for the posts on [RPG.NET](http://RPG.NET) and other sites):  
  
Greeting in Glory and in Peace!  
  
Event registration for UCON 2008 has opened, and we are actively  
soliciting events for the Tekumel Track.  
  
The con takes place at the Michigan Union in Ann Arbor Michigan, on  
the campus of the U of Michigan.  
  
The convention dates are November 21st-23rd, 2008.  
  
At least one of the authors of the latest release of game rules  
(Guardians of Order's Tekumel: Empire of the Petal Throne) will  
attend, and Tekumel fans from all over the world often make the trip  
to Michigan for this convention.  
  
But, in order for the Tekumel track to be a success, we need your  
games and events, and we need them soon and in great numbers. There  
are no requirements for any particular game system, style of game, or  
really anything else, except that it should be Tekumel related. And  
don't be shy if you've never run an event before - Tekumel players are  
very nice people, open minded, and very welcoming!  
  
Please help us out! Submit your events at [http://www.ucon-gaming.org](http://www.ucon-gaming.org)!

I also followed up before each deadline. Â I also did a brief blog with updates.
