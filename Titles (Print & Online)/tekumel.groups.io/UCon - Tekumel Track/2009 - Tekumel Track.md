Attend the words of this Humble Servant of the God-Emperor of the Mighty and  
Beauteous Empire of the Tsolyanu! Let all who hear rejoice in the beneficence  
of the Seal Imperium, and glory unto all who act nobly as befits their place and  
station!  
  
Event registration for UCON 2008 has opened, and we are actively soliciting  
events for the Tekumel Track.  
  
The con takes place at the Michigan Union in Ann Arbor Michigan, on the campus  
of the U of Michigan. The convention dates are November 13th-15th, 2009.  
  
Tekumel fans from all over the world often make the trip to Michigan for this  
convention, and at least one of the authors of Guardians of Order's Tekumel:  
Empire of the Petal Throne will attend. There is usually a Tekumel-related  
LARP, and discussions of various aspects of the World of Tekumel, the creation  
of Prof. M.A.R. Barker. (For more information, visit www.tekumel.com )  
  
But, in order for the Tekumel track to be a success, we need your games and  
events, and we need them soon and in considerable numbers. There are no  
requirements for any particular game system, style of game, or really anything  
else, except that it should be Tekumel related. And don't be shy if you've never  
run an event before - Tekumel players are almost always very nice people, open  
minded, and very welcoming!  
  
Please help us out! Submit your events at [http://www.ucon-gaming.org](http://www.ucon-gaming.org) !
