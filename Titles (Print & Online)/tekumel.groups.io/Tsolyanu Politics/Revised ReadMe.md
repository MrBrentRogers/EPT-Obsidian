I can't edit the original file, as my yahooid has changed, so instead I'm posting this revision. As noted in the first file, these posts where collected in 2000, though they date to no later than 1998. All but one came from the now-defunct Blue Room list. Contrary to the original ReadMe, there is now a complete searchable archive for the Blue Room list, available at www.tekumel.com.
