Explanatory Note, 21 October 2000These files are the most recent news of Tsolyanu I could find, saved from the Blue Room email list.  The most recent date from 1998; there was no more information on current political stuff posted to the Blue Room in '99, and the list has been defunct since then.  For those who don't know, the Blue Room  was a moderated email list dedicated to the background/world-building aspects of Tekumel (no game mechanics allowed) to which Professor Barker occasionally contributed.  The list went dormant when it's moderator was overcome by reality, and there are no comprehensive archives available at this time.  There have recently been rumors of a revival of the list and archives at www.tekumel.com, but nothing concrete as yet.
