[Note from George the Poster to Egroups: I am not sure of the source of this,
and the dates are a bit off.  Mirusiya's ascension was at the beginning of 2369]

Now that Chris Davis' schedule has loosened up sufficiently to allow him
to post messages again, the best place would be the Blue Room Mailing
List at blueroom@prin.edu.  

At last check, it is autumn, 2368.  Mirusiya is Emperor, Rereshqala is
in Avanthar as head of the High Chancery (the bureaucracy of Avanthar
if I'm not mistaken).  Taksuru has taken the position of High General
of the Empire.  Mirusiya remains missing.  I haven't heard what's happened
to Ma'in Kruthai recently.  Dhich'une remains off-plane, but is nonetheless
a thorn in the side and a pain in the ass.

Aremala is in Tumissa being a sculptress.  Surundano is somewhere being
a file clerk.  A couple of other Heirs were revealed at the presentation
of the Gold, and they also relinquished the Gold.

The Baron Ald has returned to his capitol and is putting down upstart
regions of Yan Kor that tried to take advantage of his involvements in
Tsolyanu in 2366-67 to break away.  Ald is in the constant company of
Lady Kalusu hiViridame, with whom he struck up a relationship while
in Bey Su assisting first Dhich'une and then Mirusiya.

The Mu'ugalavyani continue their consolidation and oppression of Livyanu,
distributing their pernicious anti-magic stones in patterns which cut off
magical power to whole cities and regions.  Some concern has arisen that
their distribution of these anti-magic areas -- sometimes in lightly-
populated and otherwise unimportant areas -- is meant to establish a 
larger pattern of patterns, encompassing whole portions of the Livyani
peninsula in its magically-dead zone of effect.  

In Tsolyanu, the Mu'ugalavyani have seized Butrus, and plans are rumored
to be underway for an expeditionary force led by General Arumel hiChankolel
to seize it back.

The Livyani continue to battle back, recently defeating the Mu'ugalavyani
at Neihei (sp?), led by the resistance leader known as Fireface.  She 
acquired her name surviving the Mu'ugalavyani plague that slew so many
of her compatriots but left her with a bright red rash-like scar on her
face.

The Shen were also impacted by the False Plague, and have withdrawn into
their own nation, having no present interest in the goings-on to their north.

The Salarvyani continue their forays into southeastern Tsolyanu, but no
serious invasion seems to be underway as Mirusiya continues to reunite and
reorganize the Empire.  Rumor has it that Salarvyani worshippers of Black
Qarqa are somehow assisting the Mu'ugalavyani.

Of Saa Allaqi and places northeast I know little, save that in Lorunje the
peasants speak of a recent revolution? coup? changeover? in ther rulers who
live in mountaintop keeps.

That's what I know!  Much of it may be wrong!
