POSSIBLE DIRECTIONS FOR THIS CAMPAIGN

This should centre thematically around family, clan, and revenge, all subjects close to the Tsolyani heart. For maximum drama the siblings could return to Jakalla to find that the Bright Sword clan has essentially been wiped out by the Golden Lintel, who really went for the jugular once they had a patron who was willing to act ignobly. That would leave the group essentially clanless, opening up options for:

1. Reforming the Bright Sword and restoring it. There are some good suggestions for adventures of this type in Joe's playtest rules, campaign #7 "The Hall of Stone will Rise Again"

2. Trying to survive and gain membership of another clan while they plot revenge (eg. Emerald Circlet, Scarlet Mantle, or Scarlet Planet of Knives). See campaign #3 "This Sword for Hire" in the playtest rules, or even #6 "Here comes the Judge".

In both options they'll need to prove a claim to citizenship and re-establish ties in their home city. Thus there are also elements of Just Off the Boat style play, and indeed the players do not have to know a lot about Tekumel to begin play (after all, their characters were not older than 10 when they left and Tsolyanu will be unfamiliar after all that time).

Once they have established a HQ they can go about the proper business of avenging their family. They may have a case for the Black Y (assassins) but this may be too expensive or not feasible because the only "crime" is the murder of a low life gambler, and this option lacks the personal touch. The PCs should uncover the story slowly. The easiest target is the lone prison guard, the slavers are rather harder (and have lots of resources), the Golden Lintel is a tough nut and Mr Worm should be very hard to pin down.

Of course other complications can be added as needed; perhaps a pursuing party of Salarvyani assassins, Mr Worms ascent on the coat-tails of Dhichune, the discovery of their father begging on the streets of Jakalla, and so on. In fact, has their mother actually begun to love her slave-master, or is that just an Eye of Exquisite Power over Maidens he has trained on her?

Due to the unorthodox nature of the PCs origin they may have skills not possessed by the average Tsolyani, but they'll still need judicious doses of luck and wits to oust their nemesis.
