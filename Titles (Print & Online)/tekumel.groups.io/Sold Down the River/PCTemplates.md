Sold Down the River

PC Templates

by Ray Gillham

All characters are of the Zhnayu lineage (High) in the Bright Sword clan (very low). The names given below are "pet names" given in childhood before ritual naming in adolescence (in fact the PCs may have to register as adults on return to Jakalla!). They are based around some personality trait or a facet of the child's astrology chart. No-one has yet declared a temple, though they know all the names of Pavars pantheon. This is another rite of passage to be played in-game.

The templates have certain minimums for Stats, Attributes/Defects and most skills have been pre-selected though. In general they are based on 30 Stat Points and the usual allocation of Skill Points.

I've tried to present a range of character types so there should be something for everyone; that said, I've run this set-up phase twice (using Tirikelu rules) and most players go for the combat types. I also photocopied character drawings from the "Eye" (Martin Helsdon's excellent work) and put them beside the templates so players could "put a face to the name" as it were. At the start of the campaign Resources are effectively zero (until they re-establish themselves). Each character receives the following skills after their "apprenticeship" in the Koyluga household:

Etiquette 1

Speak Salarvyani 1

Government (Intrigue) 1

Each character has the Attribute "High Lineage 2" and the Defect "Second Class Citizen 5 (manumitted slave)". The costs and bonuses have already been figured in.

1. KHIVASHA, "Helper"

Male, 25, Intelligence 4+ and Charisma 5+

Stat Points 30 Skill Points 22

The eldest siblings by mere seconds over his twin Thanudu, Khivasha always displayed loyalty and duty as his main virtues and settled in as Bubish's major-domo. He regards himself as head of the "exiled" lineage and has made sure that all family members have maitained their knowledge of Tsolyani language and customs, at least those he could remember well enough.

2. THANUDU, "Ice Cold"

Male, 25, Willpower 5+, Strength 4+, Charisma 3 or less

Stat Points 31 Skill Points 2

Thanudu has no desire to lead the family and never has. He was always a dark hearted child and adapted to life in a harsh country better than anyone except his twin brother. He was singled out for some of the messier assignments, which he has tackled with relish. He would make a very good assassin were it not for his complete lack of subtlety.

3. FARZHAI, "Mask"

Female, 23, Psyche 5+ and Intelligence 4+

Stat Points 32 Skill Points ??

The quietest sibling, and most enigmatic of the group. Regarded by all but Changil as a bit strange. She has mostly been left to her own devices except for singing performances (she has a hypnotic voice) and has taken to studying divination and making esoteric sculptures. She goes missing for long periods of time.

4. KUNI DHALI, "Beautiful Hawk"

Male, 19, Charisma 5+ and Dexterity 4+

Stat Points 30 Skill Points 2

Likely to beat off admirers of either sex, Dhali used his skills of seduction to get as much information from Bubish as possible. He is incredibly vain and loathe to admit weakness of any kind. If things don't go his way he is prone to underhand methods, in both love and war. In many ways Dhali is already the archetypal Tsolyani dandy.

5. BARA, "Quarreler"

Female, 18, Strength 5+, Intelligence 4+, Charisma 4 or less

Stat Points 33 Skill Points 5

The fiercest and most argumentative of the eight, Bara became Bubish personal bodyguard when inside his chambers. She is blunt though her approach often retains logic. Some would be surprised that she is literate and maintains a keen interest in the Dragon Warriors of Nlussa.

6. CHAMANGESH, "Pious"

Male, 17, Psyche 5+ and Charisma 5+

Stat Points 32 Skill Points 5

The most overtly religious of the siblings, studying Shirringayi but fully aware that this is an amalgam of the Tsolyani deities Avanthe and Dlamelish. His studies have taken him into heretical areas, particularly his fascination with the purged Paraiah Gods. He tells colourful tales and is keen to meet creatures from the Planes Beyond (!).

Note: I made "Naive" up as a 1 point Defect. Needs to be role-played.

7. TSOKALON, "Scout"

Male, 15, Dexterity 5+, Strength 4 or less

Stat Points 34 Skill Points 0

The fleetest of foot and in some ways the greatest loner of the group, Tsokalon is independent, resourceful, and a skilled skirmisher. He has a smattering of tomb robbing lore and would try that given a chance. Like Farzhai, he is away for prolonged periods and rather taciturn about his experiences.

Attributes

8. CHANGIL, "Inquisitive"

Female, 14, Intelligence 5+ and Charisma 4+, Psyche is zero

Stat Points 25 Skill Points 4

The best pure scholar and the sibling that Bubish allowed free reign in his private library - and kept close due to her abilities as a Psychic Dampener. Her skills at archaeology and languages would aid any endeavour in the Underworlds. She is bookish but intently curious, and "little sister" is well liked by all.

OK, that's all there is for the start-up campaign Sold Down the River. Thanks for sitting through it, hope it had some ideas you could steal. And apologies for any rather turgid prose :-).
