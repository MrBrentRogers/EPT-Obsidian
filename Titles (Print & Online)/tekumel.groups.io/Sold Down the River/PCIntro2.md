Sold Down the River

Player Intro 2

by Ray Gillham

The Weaver of Skeins appeared to be in inscrutable mood. You were taken to the opulent home of a soft-spoken Salarvyabi who you were to call master Bubish. He was a Koyluga, the family who ruled a city named after them, and Bubish had bought you as his personal attendants. Just what eight children from Jakalla could possibly do for an ageing Salaryani wasn't quite clear, though his relatives scowled and tutted at every opportunity. Over the years his purpose became clearer...

Salarvyani is nominally ruled by the supreme governer at Tsatsayagga, but in reality the great families control their own areas with a large degree of autonomy. Particularly strong are the elites of Koyluga, Heru, and Chame'el. All the families spy and steal, assassinate one another, and vie for prestige and power. Bubish had his hands in many of these schemes, and he had enemies. Many enemies.

You could hardly believe it of such a kindly old man. La, he had some strange ways but he kept you all close - even discussed your clan and family - and rarely gave chores that were uninteresting to those performing them. "Helping fulfil your natures" he called it. As you got older the errands increased: listening to conversations, taking items from people and houses, taking messages to strangers, delving in family archives and crypts. That sort of thing, like a game. Each of you was appointed a tutor appropriate to your needs and within a few years Bubish leaned on you all heavily. His family hated it and more than once you heard him called mad. This was dutifully reported of course, and rarely did you see the offender in Bubish's house again. Or anywhere else for that matter.

As the summers came and went you more or less settled into defined roles in the household:

Khivasha, the major-domo and estate manager

Thanudu, the enforcer of displeasure

Farzhai, the astrologer

Kuni Dhali, the mole

Bara, the personal bodyguard

Chamangesh, the devoted pupil

Tsokalon, the scout

and Changil, the researcher

Certaibly the Koyluga family had more skilled staff to tend to the old man, but Bubish would have none of it. After your tenth anniversary in Salarvya, Bubish would hardly talk to other members of his family, and you were practically his sole deputies and dependents.
