Sold Down the River

Player Intro 1

For the last dozen years you and your siblings have been slaves in Salarvya, owned by the noble Bubish Koyluga. But this was not always so...

All eight of you were born in the port city of Jakalla in southern Tsolyanu, the children of Achan and Sayi of the Zhnayu lineage of the Clan of the Bright Sword. Your clan was modest and made up mainly of musicians, dancers, poets and puppeteers. Only Khivasha and Thanudu remember this time with any clarity, and their accounts differ. But this is clear: when the eldest of you was 12 years old your father Achan got into terrible trouble, the kind that your mother thought would cost him his life. He went missing for nights at a time - to play at Kevuk and drink rice-wine some said - and your mother would sit by the clan-house door waiting for his return. All of you remember something of arguments, remonstration by clan elders, and tearful hugs from your mother as Achan went out again into Jakallas dusty streets. After one heated exchange he did not return...

When the slavers came from the Collar of Bronze there was surprise and anger. They said that Achan had fled his debts in the city, and as was Tsolyani custom his immediate family count be held accountable in his stead. All of you, even three year old Changil, were quickly dragged from the courtyard and hauled off to the slave markets in Jakalla's northside. The auction was completed before you could catch your breath. When the sweating throngs had departed a pale, shrivelled, looking man fastened a bronze slave torc around your mothers neck. He led her away, kicking and spitting, and you lost sight of her as the chlen-carts kicked up the dust and debris of the market-place.

Time seemed to move swiftly after that. Onto a chlen-cart and out to the city wharves, a heavy man with a pomaded beard prodding you and striking some kind of agreement with a slaver before taking your chains and leading you away. Then onto a ship that smelled of foreign spices and put below decks. When the harsh sun-light next shone in your eyes you were dirty, under-nourished, and infested with lice. The bearded man hauled you out onto the upper decks and gave a throaty laugh.

"Welcome to Salarvya," he said "the last home you will know until Missum steals you from your bed and speeds you to the Isles of Teretane". You were marched off to face whatever fate the Weaver of Skeins had in store..
