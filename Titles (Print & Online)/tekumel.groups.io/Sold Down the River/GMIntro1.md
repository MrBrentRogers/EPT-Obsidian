Sold Down the River:

GM Info 1

by Ray Gillham

15 YEARS AGO

A member of the Bright Sword Clan in Jakalla flees his gambling debts rather than be sold into slavery. His wife and children are sold in his stead and their clan does not move to redeem them. The mother and children are separated on the wharf and led away to their respective fates...

Backstory: The truth behind this event is rather more complicated (isn't it always). The gambler's wife was a truly beautiful clan-girl and an entertainer of some skill and repute for someone so low-born. A wealthy member of the Glory of the Worm clan coveted her mightily, but unusually she was not as sexually liberal as the average Tsolyani expects. Thus the Sarku worshipping Worm member hatched a plan through contacts, bribery, and blackmail.

It went something like this: the debtor is arrested for unpaid gambling debts and handed over to the Hands of Compassion Clan (prison guards). The guards at Hands of Compassion make sure that no messages get through from the man's clan and likewise that his messages are lost on the way out. When the money is not forthcoming the Golden Lintel (money-lenders) foreclose on his debts and his wife and children are handed over to the Collar of Bronze (slavers). All this is orchestrated by Mr Worm.

The gambler is disposed of quietly and the public explanation is that he absconded and thus brought great dishonour on his clan and lineage. The Glory of the Worm guy turns up at the slave markets and gets the girl. The children are dismissed with a flick of the wrist and sold off to the highest bidder, as Mr Worm has no use for them. The records show that they are purchased by an agent of the Koyluga family, a powerful Salarvyani faction.

FOR THE LAST 15 YEARS...

The eccentric and paranoid Salavryani has trained the children - now young men and women - as his personal retinue. To outside appearances they are no more than dancers, singers, servants, and companions. But to their master they are also spies, thieves, and confidants. The Salaryani noble, a ranking member of the Den of Profitable Joy - trusts no-one, and purchased young malleable slaves to be his eyes and ears. No-one will notice them and most will this this purchase another indication of their mad uncle's foibles. His plan does indeed go (mostly) unnoticed, though in the strife that continually besets Salarvyas great families it bears little real fruit. Still, the noble grows attached to his "renyu" and as time passes he treats them well.

THREE MONTHS AGO...

The noble breathes his last, surprisingly in repose in his bedchamber rather than from the assassin's knife. His last instruction is that his slaves be freed to return to their homeland, and in his final audience he spells out some (but not all) of the details of their descent into slavery and the people responsible for brining it about. The young exiles must return to Tsolyanu before the noble's family get suspicious and have them disappear permanently.
