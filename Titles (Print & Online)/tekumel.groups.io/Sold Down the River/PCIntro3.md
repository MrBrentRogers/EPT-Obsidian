Sold Down the River

Player Intro 3

by Ray Gillham

It is two years since Bubish drew the heavy curtains and with it the rest of Tekumel. He hasn't spoken to an outsider for more than three kiren since. He is dying, and you know it. His breath is ragged, his hands shake, and he no longer oils his beard or hair, what's left of it. For days you have been shooing away relatives as you wait outside his chambers. They curse you, the Tsolyani renyu, and they wait for Bubish to die. When that happens, no-one will be left to protect you.

Late at night, with the greenish light of Gayel flooding through the creaking house, Bubish summons you to his chambers. With a rasp he explains the predicament you know you are in

"I have made my death-wishes known, but my family will contest it and you will not receive a copper coin from my estates, nor sanctuary anywhere in Koyluga territory. But I can make one binding command, as is my right as a dying man. My final order is that you unfasten those torcs and breath as free men and women. You must leave me and this old house tonight and return to Tsolyanu. Take whatever valuables will not be missed, whatever armour and weapons you can find, and return to the land of your birth. If you stay, you will live no longer than a butterfly in the Layorda swamps."

He pauses,"There is another reason to return home", he wheezes, "Your clan did not abandon you all those years ago. Your father was prevented from contacting them. Someone very badly wanted to possess your mother and decided to do so by ruining your family and taking her as a slave. I don't know all the details but I know the name of the prison guard who ignored the pleas of your clan. He was Norumen hiMrekka of the Hands of Compassion. The whole process was pre-determined, though I only learnt of this in the last few years. I did not tell you then because I knew you would escape to seek revenge, and I would be alone. I ask forgiveness"

Bubish groans and spittle dribbles from his mouth. Changil tries to sooth him but he waves her away. "Take the stairs to the cellars and follow the steps below that. You will come to a tunnel hewn from rock. Walk three or four tsan, never deviating from the main route. At the end of that you will find the means to return to Jakalla"

He breathes heavily. "Go!" he says, and then turns away into his pillows.

----------------------------------------

And that's where it all kicks off, unless you want to run some prelim sessions before Bubish dies. The transport at the end of the tunnel can be anything you like, eg. tubeway of the ancients, boat, flying thingy, a caravan to travel in-cognitio in, whatever. Good luck!
