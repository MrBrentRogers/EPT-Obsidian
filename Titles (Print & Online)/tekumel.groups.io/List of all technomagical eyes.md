|**Frequency  <br>(in 175)**|**Name**|**Source**|**Rough Description**|
|---|---|---|---|
|3|**abominable eye of detestation**|(Source Book)|This Eye causes all targets, including undead, to flee, as per the Panic spell. This effect can be resisted by a IQ roll. Since this Eye is especially effective against undead, they must roll against IQ-2. A 2-yard radius may be affected. The effect lasts 1 minute.|
|1|**compelling eye of ecstatic gratification**||This Eye has been frequently found within the temples dedicated to Lady Dlamelish, and Her Cohort Mistress Hrihayal, and other associated foreign deities. It produces instant surges of ecstatic sensual, sexual, and euphoric pleasure. It produces these sensations that are like the lower levels of the ‘Concupescence’ spells from Gardasiyal/ S & G. A MRF save is permitted (vs L20), an each application will last for 1 turn. A target will be rendered incapacitated while under the effects of waves of pleasure and sensuous gratification (as it’s hard to concentrate upon anything else!).<br><br>A person using this Eye upon themselves will have to make a Willpower saving % roll at a ‘ Difficult’ level, to resist the urge to immediately use it again upon themselves. Characters of Intelligence of 80% or more will have wisdom enough to reduce the ‘temptation’ roll at an ‘Easy’ level. Each application will cause a temporary loss of –5 Stamina Points and reduce their Experience Level (Or Highest Professional Skill) by –1 Level. All these effects will be regained again after normal rest through a good night’s sleep.<br><br>After the effects of this Eye cease, the target will also be overcome with a partial lassitude which will last for _ hour (1 Kiren), during which all Skills are reduced by –20% (per application). During this time, they will suffer from a lack of motivation, enthusiasm, and mobility. All movement will be reduced to the minimum rate. The lassitude will encourage sleep, and the affected will have to Roll a Resistance Roll at ‘Easy’ level (initially) or curl up and recuperate with a ‘nap’ for 1-4 hours afterwards. The Resistance difficulty rises by 1 level worse for each successive application of the Eye in the same day, and the ‘sleep’ dice are cumulative with each use. Persistent and repetitive use can therefore really ‘knock someone out’ for a quite a while.<br><br>It works upon all fauna and living creatures, however it causes ‘pain’ and incapacitation to all undead creations, even non-corporeal ones, while they are under the effects (1 turn). The incapacitation causes the victim(s) to writhe in ‘agony’ reducing their Willpower, fighting capacity and movement by –50% per application, cumulative. (i.e.: an Undead at L8 would become l4, then L2, then L1 etc). All creatures may have a MRF roll to resist the effects of the Eye, but undead targeted by it will save at a MRF value of 4 instead of 8. Range = 60' / Affects 1-6 beings / Duration = 1 turn.|
|1|**convenient eye of unburdening the load**|(Scrolls Of Pavar)|This lifts any inanimate, non-living object of up to size L (large), by temporarily relieving it of its gravitational mass, so that it floats ‘weightless’. The distance above the ground was usually pre-set at 3 feet (1m) but can be altered if this is pronounced after activation in the ‘Tongue of the Ancients’! It lasts for 2-12 turns and the target must always remain within 30’ of the Eye . Activation range is 10'. This Eye will affect androids and automatons but will not work upon any object that is fixed to the ground or similar.|
|1|**excellent eye of Qindanu the cartographer**||Qindanu was reputed to be one of the last ‘Technomancer’ (a ‘scientific sorceror’ who understood the link between magic and technology) from the Wizards of the Latter Times. He was a brilliant Tinalya who also made the mechanical artifact, “The Questing Bird” [See Tékumeli Magic Items Lists]. Upon aiming the iris of the Eye, and pressing the stud, the Eye sends a signal through space and time to orbital Satellites around Tékumel during the last few moments of time before The Great Cataclysm (thereafter ‘The Time of Darkness’). These satellites scan the ‘target area’ in current time and construct a 2D Map that is instantly produced. The Map area is computed according to whether you are above or below ground. If underground or inside a structure on the surface, then it creates a 100’ x 100’ map. If located freely upon the planet surface, then a 1000’ x 1000’ area topographical map. The Scale of the Map area may be upgraded by depressing the Eye’s stud in quick succession, with each extra charge altering the scaling UPWARDS logarithmically (Base 10).<br><br>Strong Radiation or magically rich locations such as Nexus Points, tend to disrupt the Map’s clarity for some unknown reason, and all topographical references and markings are detailed in the ‘Language of The Ancients’.|
|10|**excellent ruby eye**|(Source Book)|This device puts the targets into permanent time stasis, until released by another charge from the Ruby Eye. The victims cannot be harmed by any means. The name comes from the reddish lustre that victims of this eye acquire. Persons have been released from the effects of this Eye after many millennia with no ill effects. This Eye affects all within a 3m area and has a range of 6m. Treat as a missile weapon for distance modifiers. Targets get a 3d/DX roll to avoid the effects.|
|1|**eye of advancing the temporal cycle**||This rare Eye was another early experimental production model that was discontinued after a while due to ‘technical difficulties’. It will advance the subject’s Lifecycle by approximately one quarter of the normal total lifespan. This is equivalent to one generation. Therefore, in human terms, this would make a newborn babe into a 20-25-year-old adult. This effect cannot be ‘dispelled’ but could further be reversed by the Temple of Lady Dlamelish’s “Rejuvenation” spells.<br><br>The progression stages that are caused by each activation of the Eye are as follows: Baby \| Young Adult \| Mature Adult \| Old Age \| Death<br><br>The advancement depends upon where the subject lies upon the Timeline. The exact numerical age of the subject depends upon their sex and species, so the GM may adjudicate this. The Eye was initially designed to assist in the maturation of livestock and even rare plants (e.g.: Orchids), as well as other experimental uses (Even as a form of State Punishment instead of lengthy and expensive prison terms). However, the process showed some signs of instability, and so production was halted. There are perhaps only a handful of these Eyes now left. There is a further 10% chance after an application of the subject continuing to age without ‘treatment’ after each maturation cycle, at the rate of a further 1 Generation per day. A new-born baby therefore could die of old age within a week. A temporally displaced or out-of-phase creature, non-corporeal, undead, sorcerous produced creatures and automatons are unaffected. Range = 30' / Duration = Permanent / Affects : 1 being only per charge.|
|3|**eye of advancing through portals**|(Source Book)|This Eye projects a 11/14/17 burst of damaging force (strong enough to blast a hole up to 1” wide and 1” long through solid rock). A living target is not attacked directly but instead must leap clear of the area of effect (9.6.1). No Resistance Check is allowed. Although this device may seem to be an excellent weapon, its short range renders it dangerous to the user as well as the intended target. This Eye will not affect masonry protected by the 72B variant of Warding. Diam: 1”; Ran. 3”|
|3|**eye of aerial excellence**|(Source Book)|The user and other targets within the circle of effect are able to rise to a height of 12” and fly at a rate of 12” per combat round. A Resistance Check is allowed to those who do not wish to fly. Targets may melee or fire missiles normally, although passengers must stay within the circle of effect (centred on the user). The direction and height of the party's travel are under the control of the user. Non-living targets must be held or attached to a living target, and no more than a total of 600 kilograms can be lifted. Diam: 3”; Dur: 30 minutes.|
|4|**eye of all-seeing wonder**|(Source Book)|A beam 2 yards wide that has the effect of the See Invisible and Light Jet spells is produced by this Eye. The beam lasts for 10 minutes and has a range of 20 yards. This device projects a beam of white light which reveals all invisible objects within its cone of effect. Resistance Checks are futile against this effect. A target thus made visible becomes invisible again upon leaving the area of effect. Diam: 1”; Ran: 12”; Dur: 10 minutes (Per Novels: this can also reveal Mihalli, Servitors of the GotPB, and remove any glamour’s or concealment effects, GM discretion)|
|1|**eye of annulling maladies**||This will heal all bodily diseases, either natural or sorcerous in nature. Will eliminate all fungi, parasites, diseases and even radiation sickness! (It will not heal the damage caused by these maladies. That must be addressed by other means). All the parasitic minions of dread Lord Sarku (and related deities or demons) that are within the cone of effect are destroyed (save permitted). The beam has a 60-degree arc over 30' range from the iris. The stud may be kept depressed as the user rotates over a 360-degree arc, however this will use 6 charges per ‘sweep’. If applied to a target creature that is affected by disease or infested with parasites, then it will work up to size H (huge). It is thus possible to destroy one of the horrific Aqua or ‘Worms of the Catacombs ‘(save permitted). Sarku’s ‘Worms of the Night’ are non-corporeal creatures and will remain unaffected (They must be dispelled).|
|1|**eye of annulling the machines of the ancients**||The effect of this Eye is to temporarily disrupt the power flow to technological machines or devices, so that they can be serviced or de-activated. It causes a selective EMP pulse that temporarily prevents the ability of the device to power it’s function. It causes Automatons to “freeze” or deactivate, Aircars to plummet from the Sky, etc. It even stops the function of other Eyes (MRF save allowed, L20 vs L20). This effect is only temporary, and it will not destroy or deplete them. It will also have no effect upon items, beings or spells of sorcerous and non-technological origin, nor can it cancel existing magical effects.<br><br>It has a distinctive beam that lances out towards a target and is twinkling ‘vapourous’ blue in appearance. Strangely, the beam is blocked by the metal Lead.<br><br>The range is 1200 feet, instantaneous, with all technical devices MRF saves at ‘0’. It lasts for 2 turns per charge, before power is restored to affected circuits and conduits. Against other Eyes there is a standard L20 vs L20 MRF save, which is 60%.|
|1|**eye of assured abundance**||This Eye increases the fertility or yield of any flora or fauna species, including non-humans and humankind. It will NOT work upon artificially created creatures or those of sorcerous or demonic origin. A crop yield will be increased by 200-300% for up to a 1000' x 1000' area. For creatures, the normal litter will be multiplied by 2 to 4 times that of normal. WARNING: Successive applications of this Eye before crop harvest or target creature’s full term will produce horrible and increasingly lethal or unfavourable mutations. There is a 25% cumulative chance of destroying the crops or killing the offspring of the target creature (up to size H – huge). If the Eye is used upon a male, then it will increase the target’s virility and fertility by 2 to 3 times (Or from 85 to 99% effective). If used again within 24 hours on the same male, then it will permanently sterilise them! This will result in a loss of vitality equivalent to a loss of -20% of Willpower (My Tékumel campaign), -20% of Pedhetl and –20% of Constitution or 10 points of Stamina (Swords & Glory Vol 2 or Gardasiyal). A magic resistance saving roll is permitted. Range = 60'.|
|3|**eye of being an unimpeachable shield against foes**|(Source Book)|This Eye produces the effects of the Shield of Defense spell on all targets within a 2-yard radius of the user for 10 minutes. The area of effect moves with the Eye<br><br>This Eye forms a shield around the user and those within its circle of effect. No Resistance Check is allowed. This shield moves with the Eye and cannot be penetrated by blows or missiles from without. Those inside may strike out through it or at opponents who are within the shield themselves. Slow moving objects and substances e.g., gas, lava) penetrate the shield normally (as do spells, the effects of magico-technological devices, amulets, talismans, etc.). An opponent can also slowly push into this sphere, taking 3 combat rounds to do so, during which time those within the shield may strike at him/her with impunity. Once inside, the opponent has the same combat advantages as those already in the sphere. Diam: 3”; Dur: 10 minutes|
|1|**eye of bestowing life**|(Source Book)|This eye will return a recently (i.e. within the span of the game) killed character back to life with full stats. The target character must be "dead" and adjacent with the character using the Eye. It does not work on Artificial or Undead character; however, Undead character created by a Necromancer and later "killed" during the span of the game can be resurrected using this Eye. (They're considered "fresh" enough to bring back to life.)<br><br>This rare Eye revivifies one intelligent being (human or nonhuman) who has been dead for not more than three weeks (18 days). Only a fragment of flesh from the corpse is needed, and there is no chance of failure if the Eye functions properly. Only one fragment of a single person can be revivified: one cannot create many "clones" by using the Eye on several fragments at once! A Resistance Check is allowed for targets who do not wish to be revivified. Targets arise with all of their combat and magical capabilities (including a full quota of spell-casting points). Clothing, magical items, and weapons are not included and must be taken from the target's corpse or provided anew. Diam: 1 target|
|1|**eye of calling forth an unconquerable army**|(Source Book)|This Eye releases a group of up to 100 mechanical automatons from a dimensional pocket. They have ST 15, DX 12, IQ 8, and MA 12. Their metal bodies stop 6 hits. They carry steel broadswords and medium shields. All automatons, including those destroyed and their equipment, return to the dimensional pocket after 12 turns. Up to 100 automatons always appear, even if some have been previously destroyed. If used in a confined area, the automatons will appear in all hexes in the room, including occupied hexes, up to the number determined above. This is a rare eye.|
|0.5|**eye of commanding the Ssu**|(Remarkable Captain Erit)|This Eye turns all Ssu targets in a 3-yard radius into slaves as for the Command spell for 10 minutes. SS 12, Acc +2, Max 60.|
|3|**eye of consummate comprehension**|Excellent travelling volume|This eye enables the user to understand any written almost human or nonhuman text read within the next six turns. This effect applies only to the user, not to anyone else, though comprehension can be given to others with the expenditure of an additional charge. After the duration ends, the user (or any other target) does not retain the ability to read previously unknown languages but does retain any knowledge gained from reading while under the eye’s effects. The eye of consummate comprehension does not grant the ability to understand the written forms of the languages of the Hlǘss, the Shunned Ones, the Ssú, or the nonhuman Mihálli.|
|3|**eye of departing in safety**|(Source Book)|This Eye transports the user and other objects or beings within the circle of effect (up to a total of 1000 kilograms) to a predetermined location within 2 kilometers. The user first focuses the Eye upon the place to which he wishes to betransported (using no charges). Thereafter, the Eye automatically carries its load to that same place (using one charge). Those who do not wish to be transported are allowed a Resistance Check. If the destination is out of range, the user and his cargo are trapped in the limitless interstices between the planes - an incomprehensible void from whence there is no returning! Diam: 5|
|3|**eye of efficacious transmission**|Excellent travelling volume|This device enables the user to send a short (25 words or fewer) vocal message to the user of another eye of efficacious transmission within 100 miles. Two eyes of this sort can be linked by touching them to one another. Thereafter, all messages sent from one are received by the other. In the absence of linking, a sent message goes to the closest eye of efficacious transmission, regardless of its current owner. If no other eye of this kind is within 100 miles, the message fails to send and does not expend a charge. Sending a message that is received expends one charge as does receiving it. A receiver can choose not to hear a sent message and thus avoid the consumption of a charge.|
|1|**eye of enhanced putrefaction**||This Eye causes an area or group of beings to quickly putrefy and rot away, like the Durritlamish Temple spell ‘Putrefaction’ (#171). The Eye was designed to reduce compost piles or animal carcasses to their base elements for recycling. Therefore – the Eye will only work upon cut and dead piles of flora or plants that have mostly died off. Similarly, it will only work upon dead flesh or carcasses. The Undead will be affected since they would be classed as ‘Dead Fauna’. This affects a 20 ft x 20ft area, (or 2-12 beings), with a range of up to 120 ft. All Undead will receive a MRF roll to resist the Eye’s effects. It takes 3 rounds for the target material to rot down to crumbling bones or to compost for dead plant matter. Range = 120' / Affects: 2-12 beings of ‘M’ size or a 20’ x 20’ area sq. of dead plants.|
|1|**eye of excellent adaptation**||This allows 1-6 beings within 40' range, the temporary ability to take in an alternate-breathing medium for 20 turns per application. Example: a Shunned One (Vleshgaya) could breathe air, a human could breathe their sulphurous gases (without harm). Range = a 2 ft. to 40 ft cone (1-6 beings of man size). The target medium respirated must be either liquid or gaseous, and of a reasonable temperature (ie: One could not ‘breathe molten magma …). If the medium that was respirated still remains within the user after the expiry time—then of course there may be repercussions!|
|4|**eye of exquisite power over maidens**|(Source Book)|This device will charm a member of the opposite sex of the user's race. The subject is allowed an IQ roll to resist. If the subject fails, they will adore the user until released by a second charge from the Eye. Treat this effect as the Loyalty and Emotion Control (Love) spells. Duration: 1 hour.<br><br>This Eye employs delicate illusions to increase the user's beauty and desirability. There are settings within the Eye to specify what is "beautiful." Unfortunately, the method of changing these was known only to the Great Ancients, and the user is enhanced by the standards of beauty of some long-dead previous owner! Since "beauty is in the eye of the beholder," this is determined by rolling a d10:<br><br>1 = The ancient owner's standards of beauty were virtually the same as those of modem Tékumel: Attractive +5 (see p. 33);<br><br>2-3 = The ancient owner's standards were slightly different: Attractive +3;<br><br>4-7 = The ancient owner's standards were considerably different: Attractive +2;<br><br>8-9 = The ancient owner's standards were completely different: Unattractive -1;<br><br>10 = the previous owner was a nonhuman (the GM's discretion as to species and sex!): Unattractive -4.<br><br>The GM may also use a negative result as a positive one, if the Eye is used outside the Five Empires. If the user is a female, the Eye works equally well upon her Appearance as perceived by males. The target is allowed to resist using its Magic Defense. Diam: 1 target; Dur: 2d10 hours|
|1|**eye of fiery breath**||This Eye will produce a ‘medium’ fire (See S & G page 140), of radius 10', up to a range of 120' (targeted). This is equivalent to the G3 version of ‘The Radiant Gaze’ spell (Page 60/61 of Vol II, Sorcery and Spells / Gardasiyal). It will slay from 1-6 beings within the circle, also igniting all flammables. Those who make a MRF save or dodge out of the impact circle will take Table D fire damage (no armour modification, and a 75% chance to ignite all carried flammable items and clothing). The fire produced may be doused. Range = 120' / Duration = instant / 10' circle (affects 1-6 beings) / Save = Table ‘D” damage.|
|3|**eye of frigid breath**|(Source Book)|A cone of freezing cold is projected by this Eye. To 10 yards, the cone is 1 yard wide; from 11 to 20 yards, the cone has a 20yd radius. Targets failing a 3d/ST roll take 5d damage. The effect is not blocked by intervening targets, so all within the cone are affected. This Eye can be used in a smaller area without harming the user. The maximum range in 20 yards. Treat as a missile weapon for distance modifiers. The effects of this Eye are not stopped by armor.|
|2|**eye of hastening destiny**||The speed of targets within the circle of effect is tripled. The target becomes a blur. Their movement is multiplied by 3, and all their DEFT-based abilities gain a bonus of +4. This effect cannot be terminated until the Eye's duration expires, but a Resistance Check is allowed for those who do not wish to be “hastened”. There is a chance of a "burn-out," moreover: at the end of every turn a d10 is rolled for each target:<br><br>1-5 = the target continues at the accelerated rate;<br><br>6-7 = the target senses an impending "burn-out" and must return to normal speed next round;<br><br>8-10 = "burn-out" occurs: the target's muscles and synapses fail, he/she suffers 8/11/14 damage during the first round; in the next round he/she becomes unconscious for 2/3/4 turns.<br><br>Diam.: 3”; Ran: 6”; Dur. 5 minutes|
|10|**eye of illuminating glory**|(Source Book)|This Eye emits a soft, whitish light all around itself. This light negates all normal darkness penalties within the area of effect. Resistance Checks are irrelevant. The user can cover this light with a hand or other object and uncover it again without using an additional charge. Once the Eye is activated, it cannot be turned off until its duration expires. Diam: 5”; Dur: 10 minutes|
|1|**eye of immaculate cleansing**||This Eye acts as a high-tech industrial steriliser and cleanser, that uses waves of ‘Y’ Radiation (Newly discovered in Mankind’s future). One being of up to size ‘L’ is “purified” of all tumours, cancers, fungi, bacteria and viruses, and the progression of internal diseases is halted. If used upon an otherwise healthy being, it will result in damage on Table ‘A’ for “burns” on the first application, and Table B for the second, and so on with more progressions. If a Critical is rolled on the Damage Table, then the subject will lose 1 Stamina point per day until death or cured by methods that heal the “Malady of the Ancients” (radiation sickness). A victim thus affected will also lose 1 extra point of blood for each wound sustained while still ill. As an additional side-effect, the radiated victim also starts to lose all bodily hair or scales, and chitin weakens progressively (softens).<br><br>Inanimate objects targeted by the Eye will be beautifully cleaned and sterilised. Unfortunately, the Eye analyses and interprets all of The Undead as all-encompassing sources of disease and destroys them utterly, into a dry crumbling ruin. Affects a 10' area circle with a 30' target range. The Eye is particularly effective against Sagun, The Affiable Blight of Lord Uni, Worms of Death, etc.|
|1|**eye of immanent encapsulation**|(Gardasiyal)|This device transfers the target into one of the smaller planes of the Planes Beyond: a spherical universe 3” (6m) in diameter. The target can resist using its Magic Defense. The target cannot move, cast spells, communicate with the outside world or otherwise act while he is in this interplanar "pocket," and no time passes for him. There are only 6 interplanar "pockets" available to each of these Eyes, and as the Eye is fired, these come up in order, like the chambers of a revolver. The contents of the current "pocket" are ejected back onto this Plane, and the target is encapsulated in their place. This Eye can be used without a specific target; it then ejects whatever is in the current "pocket" into an area ½” (1m) in front of the Eye. The GM will select or devise creatures or objects inside. Although a charge is needed to transfer a target into this eye, no charge is needed to release a target from imprisonment Encapsulation is permanent, unless a victim is released by the user. Diam: 1 target; Ran: 6”|
|3|**eye of immediate encapsulation**|Excellent travelling volume|This device transfers a single target target within 3” (and no more than 1” wide) into a small pocket plane (a sphere 1” in diameter). The target cannot move, cast spells, communicate with the outside world or otherwise act while in this plane. No time passes for the target. There are only six pocket planes available to each of these eyes and as the eye is fired, they come up in order like the chambers of a revolver. The content of the current “pocket” is ejected back onto Tékumel’s plane and the target is encapsulated in its place. The referee should determine what objects or creatures might already be in the “pockets” of any such eye found. Encapsulation is permanent unless the target is released by the user of the eye.|
|1|**eye of inanimate animation**||The original intention of this Eye was to entertain the citizens of Ancient Tékumel by animating realistic miniature figurines, by imbuing them with their own Pedhetl (‘power’). Puppets, ‘fluffy toys’ and mechanisms would be made to perform for public entertainment, children’s pantomimes, and to provide ambulation to works of art that did not have power cells ‘per se’. The Eye will only work upon a non-living item of size ‘S’ or smaller. The item or object may be directed to perform simple tasks by the holder of the Eye for 1 hour per charge used. If the Eye passes out of 100' range, then the original object will de-animate again.<br><br>Ensorcelled items may not be so animated, including machines of ancient technology. The animated object cannot perform impossible tasks beyond its physical limits or design, or complex and conditional tasks, as the item does not possess ‘intelligence’. [It is rumoured that some performing puppets (from the entertainment Puppeteering Clans have either a version of this Eye permanently installed in them, and they animate themselves ‘at will’. There are further rumours that these puppets are actually ‘fitted’ with a Life-stone which is ensorcelled and may even provide the Puppet with a ‘borrowed’ Soul as well …..]. Range = 100' / and I object per charge.|
|3|**eye of incessant alimentation**|Excellent travelling volume|This device affects 1-6 targets of more or less human size within 4”, enabling them to survive for 1 week without food per charge. Those affected by the eye must still drink, however, or they will suffer the usual ill effects. Targets who go without food for more than three consecutive weeks will not feel the need to eat, but they will still suffer from starvation, taking 1-6 points of damage per day they do not eat.|
|1|**eye of incoherency**||Used by Space-faring Humankind and Travellers, to enable them to withstand the effects of hyper-travel acceleration, extreme ‘G’ forces, crushing gravity wells. It works by putting the corporeal body into a state of de-corporeal or particulate form. (Akin to the effects of a ‘phasing transporter’, used to ‘beam’ persons, objects or cargo from one place to another.)<br><br>Direct physical energy or magical targeted attacks will pass right through the “phased” creature harmlessly. Area effects will still occupy the area of the creature, and will take effect, should the creatures take form again while the hostile gaseous substance is still around and intermingled. (Like teleporting into a poison gas cloud). A second activation of the Eye is required to restore the being or item again to its reconstituted form again. While incorporeal, the being may react with other non-corporeal beings, spirits and so on. The character may not interact with the physical world again, until ‘restored’ again by the Eye.<br><br>Odd numbers of charges remaining in the Eye, imply that an object or being is still non-corporeal ‘Somewhere’. An unfortunate being may become ‘trapped’ in its de-corporal form, with no charges remaining in the Eye! The effect cannot be ‘dispelled’. Stellar ships were later fitted with the decorporallization device internally, and thus there may be hope for one so ‘stranded’. Range = 20' and 1 being/ charge.|
|4|**eye of incomparable understanding**|(Source Book)|The speech of any being within the circle of effect is telepathically translated into the user's native language, and the user's replies are similarly telepathically translated into the targets' tongue. Both human and nonhuman languages are made comprehensible, although some nonhuman languages are conceptually so alien that they can only be partially translated - or not at all. This Eye does not operate upon written language. Diam: 3”; Ran: 3”; Dur: 30 minutes|
|2|**eye of indefinable apprehension**|(Source Book)|Targets within the effect area of this Eye flee in terror away from the user, or toward a safe refuge, as determined by the GM. One combat round is required for this Eye's effect to travel to the targets, and if the latter guess that this Eye has been fired at them by making an INTL check at -1 (one check only for the highest INTL in the target group), they can try to dispel it with the 5C variant of Disenchantment before it arrives. If this defense fails and they fail their magic resistance checks, they run away, blindly and precipitously. This device does not affect the Undead, other-planar creatures, Thúnru'u,or, for unknown reasons, human women. Diam. 5”; Ran: 12”; Dur: 10 minutes|
|3|**eye of ineluctable verity**|Excellent travelling volume|This device projects a beam with a range of 12” at a single target, which is allowed a saving throw. If the saving throw is failed, the target is unable to utter a falsehood for the next 1-6 turns. If the target attempts to do so, he is wracked with increasing pain, dealing 1-6 points of damage upon speaking the first lie, 2-12 points of damage upon speaking the second lie, and so on. There is no upper limit to the amount of damage potentially dealt by this effect. The eye only affects humans, Páchi Léi, Pé Chói, Pygmy Folk, Shén, Swamp Folk, and Tinalíya. All other intelligent species are immune to it, as are automatons and the undead.|
|1|**eye of infallible returning**|(Gardasiyal)|This Eye infallibly guides the user back along his/her previous route to his/her starting place. The user focuses the Eye upon the starting point (using no charges) and then may travel up to 2 kilometers. When the user then presses the stud, a thin, 1- meter-long beam of white light shines from the Eye back along the path he has travelled. It indicates each twist and turn in the user's route in reverse order. Once this "trail-marker" is activated, the Eye's beam lasts 30 minutes, after which it no longer has any effect. Only the route taken by the user (and the Eye) is indicated: any faster or more direct route must be discovered through another means. If the user leaves his/her original path by more than 2” during his return trip, the "trailmarker" beam goes out, and he/she must return to the last place where the indicator appeared to continue his/her journey. If the user travels more than 2 kilometers from his/her starting place before activating the trail-marker, the Eye does not function unless he/she comes back within range. Dur: 30 minutes|
|3|**eye of infallible visioning.**|Excellent travelling volume|This device projects illusory apparitions of 2–12 human-sized creatures of any type the user wishes out to a maximum range of 6”. These phantasms fight with claws, teeth, or weapons, as appropriate, as if they were 3 hit dice creatures with armour class 7 and 18 hit points. A successful saving throw against eyes enables the viewer to see through these apparitions and disbelieve them. Unless disbelieved or defeated, the apparitions last 3 turns|
|1|**eye of inimitable psychic nullity**|(Gardasiyal) & Excellent travelling volume|This device causes beings within its circle of effect who fail a Resistance Check to lose all psychic NRG points. An affected target cannot cast spells (and loses their Resist Sorcery skill) until it regains a positive NRG score. These points can be regained only through sleep or rest (see 12.5). Furthermore, any Azure Scarab (created by spell #126) is destroyed, and its owner takes 5/7/9 mental damage. Diam: 3”; Ran: 12”  <br>This device causes 1–6 beings in a 1” diameter within 6” who fail their saving throws to lose the use of all spells including magical professional skills. These spells can be regained through sleep or rest as normal. Furthermore, any amulet of peace amongst the servers of Ksárul within the area of effect is destroyed and its owner takes 2–12 points of damage.|
|1|**eye of instant fortitude**||This Eye raises the Morale Class of 1-6 sentient beings by an additional +1 level or rating per application. (Classes A to G as per Swords and Glory or Vol II of Gardasiyal). If elevated to “over the top” or beyond the table, then the recipient will become a Fearless Hero until the expiration or dissipation of the effect. The Hero may not voluntarily withdraw from battle thus affected. Range = 120', duration = 2 turns (20 combat rounds), affects a 10' radius circle.|
|1|**eye of instant translation to the isles of Teretané**|(Gardasiyal) Excellent travelling volume|This device is focused upon a meteor belt on another plane. Each charge pulls one meteor through and hurls it at the device's target. The meteor may be anything from a tiny pebble to a huge boulder. A d10 is rolled:<br><br>d10 Meteor Size Area Effect Damage<br><br>1 Speck 1 target 2/3/4<br><br>2-4 Fingernail 1 target 4/6/8<br><br>5-7 Fist 1” diameter 6/9/12<br><br>8 Head 1” diameter 9/12/15<br><br>9 Human 3” diameter 12/15/18<br><br>10 Too big to fit through the Eye's iris. No stone emerges. The Eye overheats and must be set down to cool for 3/5/7 rounds<br><br>No Resistance Check is allowed; to avoid these missiles each target within the area of effect must make a Dodge skill check to escape the area of effect (see 9.6), at an additional penalty of -4. The “damage” column indicates the damage taken by the primary target. Other targets within the area of effect who don’t escape take 3 points less. The magical bonus of enchanted armor and shields applies against this damage, but otherwise armor has no effect. Ran: 24”|
|4|**eye of insubstantial visioning**|(Source Book)|This Eye projects illusionary apparitions of 5/7/9 human-size creatures of any type the user wishes within the circle ofeffect. These phantasms fight with claws, teeth, or weapons, as appropriate. They have no spells or magical weapons, but they do have armor (if in the form of intelligent beings) or tough hide (if in the form of animals):<br><br>A successful perception check at -3 is needed to see through these apparitions and disbelieve them. One who has seen through these illusions is no longer affected by them. Diam: 5”; Ran: 12”; Dur: 3 minutes|
|4|**eye of joyful sitting amongst friends**|(Source Book)|This device causes targets within the circle of effect who fail their Resistance Check to become neutrally friendly for the Eye's duration. The targets do not attack, nor can they issue commands to others to do so. If the targets are attacked they will defend themselves, however. This Eye does not create real friendship nor a wish to aid the user, nor does it immobilize the targets and leave them open to attack. Diam: 3”; Ran: 6”; Dur: 10 minutes|
|3|**eye of madness**|(Source Book)|Targets within the area of effect who fail a Resistance Check (humans, nonhumans, and animals, but not automatons, androids, or undead) fall into fits of gibbering insanity. This Eye is useless against any being who has already cast a Control of Self spell of the 4A or 4B varieties upon himself/herself. Madness is permanent unless the victim is cured by the Ineluctable Eye of Healing or the 5C variant of Disenchantment. Diam: 5”; Ran: 12”|
|1|**eye of membranous collation**||This Eye ‘scans’ an area within 30' of itself, analysing it for collections of homogeneous items (i.e.: silver coins, bottles of wine, Dlel fruits, nuts, etc). It will only focus on a single type of item or substance that is portioned into similar amounts (Size ‘M’ or smaller). The Eye then collates and “shrink-wraps” the item(s) into neat and transportable arrangements of (plastic) wrapped quantities of items. Each bundle is sealed within a transparent, smooth, form-fitting artificial membrane that is resistant to heat, cold, humidity, acid, frost, etc. Man-sized items such as a statue will be individually wrapped, however significantly small items such as berries would be “collated” and wrapped into bundles—ie: 6’s, 10’s, 20’s, etc.<br><br>As an original ‘safety’ mechanism, the Eye will not work upon live Fauna or beings, however it will work upon The Undead and Automatons (a use quite unforeseen by the original designers). Each activation will also “shrink-wrap” an undead creature of size M or lesser (multitudes of smaller undead, such as scarab beetles or Worms of Death would be ‘shrink-wrapped into convenient bundles ‘product’). The clear wrapping is removable from the outside by hand with a Very Difficult Dexterity % roll (One attempt per round). For a being bound in the wrap by itself.|
|1|**eye of negative calcification**||This Eye was designed to remove the bones from fish, crustaceans, and animals before processing. It was also useful for cleaning barnacles and molluscs from ships and reducing coral from sea beds. If used against any creature, it will instantly deplete it of all calcium and other minerals …i.e.: the bones and exoskeletons. It will also affect certain sedimentary rocks, such as limestone and sandstone, weakening their structures. Sentient creatures may make a Dexterity Evasion saving roll to dodge the cone area. Those with sorcerous ability or resistance may make a MRF saving roll vs L20 to resist it’s effects instead. Range = 60' / Duration = instant / Affects: # 10' area or 1-5 beings of ‘M’ size.|
|2|**eye of non-seeing**|(Source Book)|This Eye turns all touched targets in a 6m radius invisible as for the Invisibility spell. The effect lasts 30 minutes and moves with the Eye. All targets must remain within range with the Eye at the centre to stay invisible.<br><br>The user and others within the circle of effect are put slightly out of synchronization with this Plane and become invisible (9.2.5), even in broad daylight, for the duration of the effect. The effect moves with the Eye. Only those targets who are in the circle of effect when the Eye is activated are affected, and only if they remain within the area of effect. No Resistance Check is allowed. This Eye does not affect sound: footsteps, armour clanking, etc. can still be heard. Diameter: 3” area; Duration: 30 minutes.|
|3|**eye of opening the way**|(Source Book)|The user sees into any physical object within the target area to a depth of 1 meter (1/2”), perceiving opaque shapes inside, much like an X-ray device. Resistance Checks do not apply. When used upon a person, for example, his bones and possessions appear as silhouettes of shades of grey and black. A dagger hidden under a cloak can thus be seen, as can a dark mass of coins in a pouch. Some items may be hard to recognize: a square book looks the same as a square box. This device does not penetrate metal: a breastplate appears as a single black object, and anything concealed beneath it remains hidden. This Eye can be used on brickwork and masonry: it reveals traps and secret door mechanisms in stone and wood, including walls, floors, ceilings, chests, etc. It does not penetrate barrier spells that block "psychic" magic: e.g., The Sphere of Impermeable Quiescence (#20). Diam: 3”; Ran: 6”; Dur: 5 minutes.|
|1|**eye of oral encapsulation**||This Eye has the ability to capture any audible sounds or voice, and store it in its matrix for immediate transfer into any inanimate object or substance (eg; Storage into a gem, door, statue, wall, painting, etc). The Eye works in two stages. Firstly, the amount of stored sound is determined by the time duration that the stud is initially depressed for. Once the “recording” is ended and fixed, then the next target for the Eye’s iris is the object that the sound will be transferred into (which also uses up 1 charge). Enchanted or Warded items or areas may have a MRF resistance roll to avoid being ‘implanted’ with the ‘sound series’ [See Magic Items section of Gardasiyal]. Otherwise assume that the item has a MRF factor to resist the Eye, equivalent to L8 (Eyes have a standard MRF of L20). This gives a 35% chance to resist the sound implantation.<br><br>Each additional sound recorded is implanted separately at a cost of 1 charge for the recording, and one for the implantation. The activation of the sound or the ‘replaying’ is triggered by prefixed programming in the Eye, by either:<br><br>i) Touch: by a creature within 5’ or less of the “implantation point”.<br><br>ii) By the ‘recognition’ of the same language that was used in the recording sequence (triggered at 30’ range or less from implantation).<br><br>An unforeseen use of the Eye is produced if the iris is pointed directly at a creature or sentient being. If the activation stud is depressed, the target may have all its sound capability or voice transferred into the Eye’s matrix (as per a ‘Silence’ spell). An MRF vs L20 is permitted. This occurs if there was no sound(s) stored in the Eye at the time. If there were sounds stored in it then the target being will have their normal voice or sound replaced 50% of the time, each time they attempt to communicate (Whatever the last voice recording, or sound, was …) This effect is permanent unless the Eye is re-activated again successfully against the being. Even then, there is a 50% chance (again) that the wrong sound was removed, requiring another activation! If the Eye is destroyed, then all implanted effects are nullified.|
|1|**eye of orotund fulmination**|Excellent travelling volume|By means of this eye, the user can create a cone of sound 12” long and 3” wide at its base. All within this area must make a saving throw versus eyes. Those who succeed are stunned (and thus unable to act) for 1 round and deafened for 2 rounds. Those who fail suffer 2–12 points of damage and are stunned for 2 rounds and deafened for 4 rounds. If employed against structures, the eye should be treated as a large catapult as described in Sec. 722 of the Empire of the Petal Throne rulebook.|
|1|**eye of purposeful defoliation**|Excellent travelling volume|This eye destroys all plants and fungi within a 3” radius of the user, turning them brown and desiccated. Plant and fungus creatures (e.g. the Sagún) suffer 6-36 points of damage, unless they make a successful saving throw, in which case they take only half.|
|3|**eye of raising an infernal barrier**|(Source Book)|This Eye raises a wall of flame 6” (12m) long and 2” (4m) high in front of the user. This wall adjusts to fit the size of the room or area (as far as its maximum dimensions permit). See 10.4.2 for rules regarding areas of flame. If this Eye is used as a weapon against a being by the firer, the target must make a Dodge skill check at -1 (see 9.6). If this fails, he/she takes full damage. If the target succeeds, he/she takes half damage but gets away. Ran: 3”; Dur: 2 minutes|
|1|**eye of reducing the enemy**||This Eye was accidentally created by a tinkering scholar-mage during the ‘Lords of the Latter Times’ era. (Basically, it is a ‘Reversed Thoroughly Useful Eye’). This will “suck” Other Planar Power from charged magic items, including the technological items of The Ancients. It will also dissipate from1-100 Pedhetl points from a mage or a magic-using creature that is hit by the beam.<br><br>Any mage or creature that has their store of Pedhetl reduced to zero or below falls unconscious. The remaining score of depleted points below zero is recalculated as the % Chance of that creature or mage’s instant brain death. Survivors will remain incapacitated within a coma-like state while their Pedhetl slowly returns at a rate of one point per day of rest. If they fail a MRF roll vs L20, then their psychic spell ability is reduced by one level due to the trauma.<br><br>Note: Certain out-of-phase creatures or beings sealed within an extra-temporal state (Excellent Ruby Eye, etc) are immune to the effects of this Eye. Certain spells will also protect against it, such as; ‘Vallation’ (All) G8, #68; ‘The Sphere of Impermeable Quiescence’, U10, #20; ‘The Speculum of Retribution’, G2 and upwards, #65; ‘The Muniments of Excellence’ T8, #75; ‘The Pearl-Grey Citadel’ (all variants) #179; ‘The Obsidian Obelisk’ T3 and up, #130; ‘The Inimitable Defender’ T2 upwards, #103 and the ‘The Expediter of the Skein of Destiny’ (all variants) #181. All spells except ‘The Expediter’ (Qon) that are barriers have their magical energy sapped instantly, gaining the sorcerer time to extricate themselves or react further.<br><br>If cast upon a victim (not self) immediately after the Eye’s beam hits (or before!), the spell of ‘Benefaction’ G8 may save an unfortunate mage by replenishing the Pedhetl. Range = 120' / Duration = instant (aimed beam) / Affects 1 being or item.|
|2|**eye of regeneration**|(Source Book)|This Eye heals 2/4/6 hit points and restores one lost limb or seriously injured body area, permanently and without scarring, with every use. It also repairs lost eyesight, hearing, and other injuries or defects caused by wounds or hostile magic. It does not act upon genetic defects, nor can it revive the dead, but it does heal the ravages of disease, drugs, starvation, and thirst. Assuming the Eye operates correctly, no die roll is needed to perform this healing. The target is allowed to resist using its Magic Defense. Ran 1”, Diam: 1 target|
|1|**eye of rejuvenation**||This Eye produces a ‘pick-me-up’ effect, renewing the vigour (Constitution) of 1-6 beings within 10 feet, and dissipating all feelings of lassitude and fatigue. In game terms it restores all lost Constitution, fatigue and stamina to depleted targets. To unfatigued or fit subjects, it will act as a Generic level ‘Nimbleness’ spell, adding = 10% to Dexterity or Intelligence % rolls for up to 12 turns (successive applications are not cumulative). (12 turns – 4 Kiren or 2 hours).<br><br>An application also revives and awakens those who are stunned, unconscious or in a coma (and sleeping). It also ‘cures’ the effects of hangovers and drunkenness! The adherents of Dlamelish and Hrihayal and foreign equivalents value it highly, as it assists them with their long and orgiastic rituals. Range = 60', affects 1-6 targets in a max. 10' cone.|
|1|**eye of renewing the enemy**||This Eye refills a person’s Psychic Reservoir or Pedhetl. It will also recharge depleted magical items or technological items. The amount of charge is 1–100 points per application. If this ‘renewing’ exceeds the person’s allocated maximum of natural Pedhetl, then they will have the amount in excess converted to a % chance of brain seizure, and death (ie, 40 points over Pedhetl Maximum = a 40% chance of death). Even if this does not occur, then the recipient will also have to make an instant Endurance % Roll at Real Challenge level or fall into a coma. Further rolls may be made using the Recovery chart (Swords & Glory Vol. 2, brown book), or make the same % Stamina/Con roll, once per day (Critical failure means that they do not awaken from the coma). If revived, then the recipient’s Pedhetl total will be permanently reduced by the excess amount! If magical or technological devices are over charged, then the same is similarly applied, except that if the item fails a saving roll (against destruction by level 20 magic), the it will be destroyed (or explodes, as per Eye malfunctions table). The range for using this Eye is 2' from the iris and affects only one target item or creature at a time. If used upon the Thoroughly Useful Eye, it will only renew one charge per application.|
|3|**eye of retaining all things**|(Source Book)|This device opens a dimensional pocket that can store up to 1 ton of equipment. Twisting the stud will empty the contents of this dimension; this process does not use a charge of the Eye. No oxygen exists in this pocket, so living beings will die of suffocation. Items may drift in this dimensional pocket, so multiple objects must be tied together, or bound by some other means. Any size of object, up to the maximum capacity of the dimension, can be put into the Eye, if some small corner can be put within the aperture.<br><br>This Eye opens a door approximately 75mm in diameter into a vacant dimension in which object(s) can be stored. It requires one charge to open the door to store objects, and another charge to remove them. There is no oxygen in the "pocket" plane reached by this Eye, and thus living beings cannot survive in it. A Resistance Check is thus allowed to anyone who does not wish to be ‘retained’. If several objects are to be stored, they must be roped together since otherwise they may drift out of reach. Objects of any size can be sucked into this Eye, provided only that a corner of the object is small enough to fit inside the aperture, and that it is not permanently attached to any larger object (e.g. a wall, floor etc.).|
|1|**eye of retaining the past forever**|(Gardasiyal)|Each charge from this device produces a three-dimensional cube 25mm square that contains a coloured image of an area 3” (6 meters) in diameter in front of the Eye's iris. No focusing is necessary. (A viewing device or projector is a nice accessory for this Eye, but these are rare; the image can be seen anyway with the naked eye.) This device never needs recharging, but it does require small quantities of various metals, glass, and minerals taken by other-planar means from nearby objects. A d10 is rolled every time it is fired:<br><br>1-5 = no harm is done to the user, and the Eye's requirements are removed harmlessly from the surroundings;<br><br>6-8 = a garment, weapon, or another device in the user's possession loses its strength, cohesion, or power, as the GM decides;<br><br>9-10 = the user himself/herself loses 1 hit point temporarily, and 0/0/1 hit points permanently. Diam: 3”; Ran: 6”|
|3|**eye of retarding destiny**|(Source Book)|This Eye slows the targets' perception of time. An affected being moves at half of his normal speed, and its melee and missile defences and all its ability checks suffer a penalty of - 2. This Eye affects living creatures and the undead, but not androids, automatons, creatures created by sorcery, or demons. Diameter: 3”; Range: 24”; Duration: 5 minutes|
|4|**eye of returning unto darkness**|(Source Book)|This Eye creates a sphere of darkness. No being within this sphere can see anything, nor can anyone see into or through the sphere, except by sorcerous means. The sphere cannot be moved and can only be dispelled by the 5B or 5C variant of the spell of Disenchantment. Diam: 3”; Ran: 12”; Dur: 20 minutes|
|2|**eye of rising above all**|(Source Book)|This device raises the user (plus up to16kg x his/her PHYS Value in cargo) to a height of 48” at a rate of 6” per combat round. The user controls the height to which he/she rises. He/she can drift laterally up to 1” (2 meters), but remains almost directly above the spot from which he/she fired the Eye. The user can fight with melee weapons or throw objects (with a -2 penalty to his/her chance to hit), and he/she can cast psychic (but not ritual) spells. If he/she is unencumbered, he/she can lift one other human-sized being instead. Diam: 1”; Dur: 20 minutes|
|2|**eye of ruling as a king in glory**|(Source Book)|This device causes all targets in a 40-yard radius who fail their Will roll to loyally follow the user as for the Loyalty spell for 1 hour. This Eye has no effect on animals, automatons, androids, or undead. This is a rare Eye.<br><br>This Eye uses delicate illusions to increase the user's leadership qualities. These qualities can be adjusted by settings within the Eye's casing, but the method is no longer known, and the Eye uses the standards of leadership of some long-dead previous owner. A d10 is rolled:<br><br>1 = the ancient owner's standards were virtually identical with those of modern Tékumel: +5 to WILL based interpersonal skill checks;<br><br>2-3 = the ancient owner's standards were slightly different: +3 bonus;<br><br>4-7 = the ancient owner's standards were somewhat different: +2 bonus;<br><br>8-9 = the ancient owner's leadership standards were very different: - 1 penalty;<br><br>10 = the previous owner was a nonhuman or alien: - 4 penalty. The user has no idea of his success until he/she attempts an interpersonal skill check.<br><br>At the GM's discretion, a negative result can be interpreted as a positive result in a different culture. The target is allowed to resist using its Magic Defense. Diam: 1 target; Dur: 30 minutes|
|1|**eye of safety amidst predators**||This Eye sprays the target with an “anti-predator” essence that wards off or deters away carnivorous fauna for up to 30 turns per full application. No aggressive natural creature will be able to approach closer than 20-50 feet of the protected person. A very strong wind or rainfall can reduce the essence deterrent. (5–15 feet). Creatures will not attack the scented person with ranged weapons either. Unfortunately, there is a 20% chance (cumulative per turn) that hostile creatures that are attracted to the smell of rotting meat, such as carrion-eaters and certain Undead. Carrion-eaters will detect this essence up to 300’ range from the user. Range is 20', Duration = 6 hours and affects 1 being of size ‘M’ or smaller.|
|1|**eye of sensory adaptation**||This Eye dramatically improves a single sense organ of one being (even non-corporeal creatures and automatons !). The GM can choose a sense or the PC rolls 1d6 on the following random chart below;<br><br>1 = Vision<br><br>2 = Hearing<br><br>3 = Taste<br><br>4 = Touch<br><br>5 = Smell<br><br>6 = Extra-sensory, i.e. – danger- sense or other ‘special’.<br><br>Other chances for a ‘special’ effect could be; ESP, ‘danger-sense’, precognition (extra temporal perception or foresight, extended sensory range or capacity/capability, sensing of invisible or “out-of-phase” objects, creatures, Planes and portals and so on.<br><br>NOTE: The results of using this Eye may be a blessing or a curse to the recipient! Amplified sight could result in ‘flash-blindness’ in certain circumstances (like firecrackers to a person with ‘Night-Vision’ goggles on). Extended range and capacity hearing could potentially be fatal to a Pe Choi who hears a sudden overpowering loud noise or explosion. Stun, unconsciousness or even death could result from an amplified sense of smell with a powerful/repulsive odour (a corpse pit in summer for example!). The Temple of Chiteng covets this Eye, as an aid to its interrogations, tortures and special ceremonies. Range = 30', duration = 10 turns, affects 1 being enclosed or ‘point blank’ or up to 1-6 beings (narrow cone effect), per charge.|
|2|**eye of strengthening the majesty of weapons**|(Source Book)|When fired at a steel helmet, breastplate, shield, or sword, or at arms or armor made of Lord Sárku's specially consecrated copper (see spell 135E), this Eye permanently improves the quality of the material. The item becomes enchanted for +1 physical and energy protection if it is a helmet or suit of armor,+1 damage level if it is a weapon, or +2 hits if it is a shield. This Eye has no effect upon other substances, and it can only be used once on any given object. There is no Resistance Check. Diam: 1 target|
|1|**eye of subaqueous perseverance**|Excellent travelling volume|This eye creates a 2” diameter sphere of force that can hold up to six humansized passengers, including the user. If used while on land, the projected sphere is immobile; if used underwater, it moves at a rate of 3” per round in any direction under the control of the bearer of the eye. The sphere of force protects those inside from pressure effects and contains enough oxygen for its passengers for 6 hours. The sphere is transparent, which enables those within it to see outside. The sphere can be banished at any time by the user before the internal oxygen has been used up after which it disappears on its own. The sphere affords those within it a level of protection identical to that of the Group III spell shield of defence.|
|1|**eye of the amber coating**||This Eye will produce a hard, amber-coloured polymer substance, which will cover a 10' x 10' surface, or a 3' x 3' cubic area, sealing down all items into a block or sheet of ‘adamantine’. Successive applications of this Eye against the same target will expand the coverage of the area or block. The reverse setting for ‘melting’ the substance away is achieved by turning the Eye upside down before activation. Unfortunately, it will also permanently soften and make useless (like soft “goo”); chlén-hide items, leathers, and the chitinous exoskeletons of the Pe Choi, Hluss, Ngrutha, Ghar and Hokun. A magic save is permitted against this effect. Range = 30'.|
|1|**eye of the compliant mind**||This Eye as used by the Ancient ‘Security Forces’ of interstellar Tékumel, to interrogate suspects and prisoners. It was also used by some operatives to implant hidden ‘sleeper’ instructions in subjects, that would be triggered by specified conditional circumstances (Eg: “Kill the Commander once he sleeps tonight”).<br><br>A single charge will reduce the subject’s mental resistance and enhances their cooperation for questioning (The Willpower% Stat (WILL) is reduced to 10% of its original value (I use a WILL % Stat. In my Gardasiyal game, and this constitutes the third Stat. Required to total up a Pedhetl amount for Sorcery / INT% + WILL% + Psy. Res.% // Psychic Ability is a Stat. Bonus and competence in my game).<br><br>An original Willpower % stat. of say 50% would be temporarily reduced to 05% by one charge (MRF vs Level 20 allowed) of the Eye [a Real Challenge save test to resist interrogation and suggestions afterwards!].<br><br>WARNING: If used again upon an already influenced victim, OR upon one who is Mind-Barred, ‘Jade-Arched’ or under sorcerous mental control (ie; ‘Domination’), then there is a 75% chance of pushing there mental state into either (Roll 1d6):<br><br>1 – 2 : A brain seizure (1-4 rounds), followed by a Coma.<br><br>3 – 4 : A violent bezerk frenzy, followed by a state of permanent homicidal paranoia (!).<br><br>5 – 6 : Gibbering Insanity (‘Hlakme Death’).<br><br>This Eye will also work upon intelligent non-human species, non-corporeal entities/spirits (subject to ‘Age’), and some minor Demonic Servitor Races. Duration = 3 turns (I Kiren), affects 1 subject, Range = 30'.|
|2|**eye of the creeping fog of doom**|(Source Book)|This device would produce any gas the user wanted, but the method of selection has been lost. Now most of them produce poisonous gas (roll 3d: 3-10 = nerve gas, 11-14 = contact gas, 15-18 = some harmless gas, such as carbon dioxide). The gas is expelled from the Eye at a rate of 1 yard every 2 seconds, and the resulting cloud will eventually cover an area 3 yards in radius. It will remain for 4 minutes before dispersing. Wind can blow the cloud back at the user, and the Eye cannot be used safely in a confined area, since the gas needs at least the area mentioned above to spread.|
|1|**eye of the effervescent blanket**||This Eye produces a spray of a white, slippery, foamy substance that is emitted in a cone from 10 to 60 feet in range. Its main function is to extinguish fires, solidify magma and liquid metals, etc. [See Swords and Glory, Vol II ‘Putting out Fires’ table, pg. 140]. It will raise the difficulty of moving across smooth, flat surfaces covered in the foam, by two categories ‘worse’ (ie: Easy Difficulty becomes Difficult with a Dexterity roll). The Eye will automatically extinguish a normal fire and have a base chance of 50% to put out a magical fire. Range = from 10 to 60 feet. Duration ; for 3 rounds per ‘burst’.|
|1|**eye of the gleeful stone gaze**|(Gardasiyal) Excellent travelling volume|This Eye is similar to the Excellent Ruby Eye: it surrounds the target with a red-glowing stasis field (unless a Resistance Check is made). After 3/5/7 minutes, the target's substance begins to be transformed into a chalk-like, whitish mineral, beginning with the extremities and moving to the internal organs. This transformation takes approximately 20 minutes. If the Eye is fired at the target a second time before the transformation begins, the target is released from stasis unharmed. If the release charge is fired after the transformation has begun, however, that portion of the target that has already been affected crumbles to dust; the remainder (if any) is restored and removed from stasis. The GM decides what percentage of the target is destroyed. Lost body parts can only be restored by the Eye of Regeneration or the 10C variant of the spell of Healing. The target is allowed to resist using its Magic Defense. Diam: 1 target; Ran: 6”|
|1|**eye of the glorious lord of worms**|(Gardasiyal)|This Eye infests all horizontal surfaces (and all characters who fail to make a Resistance Check) within the area of effect with tiny voracious worms. If a spell or Eye of healing is not applied within 2 combat rounds, a victim dies. Spells of Zoic Domination have no effect upon these little monsters. Anyone who enters the area of effect must make a DEFT or Acrobatics check at +2 in every space they pass through in order to avoid infestation. Diam: 3”; Ran. 6”; Dur: 5 minutes.|
|1|**eye of the scintillating artificer**||This Eye will convert one base metal into another of a different type (ie, lead to gold). This conversion however is now totally random, since the ‘voice activation code’ used to specify the end product metal was in the ‘Language of The Ancients’. After the Eye has fired at its target, roll % Dice on the table below: (metal to metal):<br><br>01% - 20% …...…. Lead<br><br>21% - 40 ……..……...Tin<br><br>41% - 60% …...….Copper<br><br>61% - 70% ……..…Silver<br><br>71% - 80% …….…..Gold<br><br>81% - 90% ……….…Iron<br><br>91 – 97% …….…Platinum<br><br>98% - 100% … ‘Duranium’ [The metal of ‘The Ancients’]<br><br>Should the metal original be the same as the result rolled on the Table, then instead Roll 1d6 on this sub-table:<br><br>1 or 2 : the metal original or object ‘vaporises’. It is ‘absorbed’ into the resources matrix portal built into the Eye.<br><br>3 or 4 : An Alloy of the two metals is created (even if this is not usually possible).<br><br>5 : A totally new Elemental metal is created, with a new name and new properties.<br><br>6 : A ‘super-hardened’ version of the original metal is created (akin to Enchantment).<br><br>The Eye does not work again upon a transformed original, or magically enchanted items. The original metal object or sample must be equivalent or under an Encumbrance Value of ‘3’ (15lbs) (or ‘per piece’). [see Gardasiyal, Section Two, Page 4, Purchase Lists in the Player’s Guide, Vol. 1].|
|4|**eye of transformation**|(Source Book)|This Eye affects one target's opinions, causing him to perceive the user as smart, brilliant, and worth following if they fail a Resistance Check. The target is not dominated or controlled, but the user has a better chance of convincing the target of a course of action, idea, etc.: a +2 modifier is applied to the user's WILL-based interpersonal skill checks. Diam: 1 target; Ran: 6”; Dur: 30 minutes|
|2|**eye of triumphant passage through infernos**|(Source Book)|This Eye protects targets within the circle of effect from nonsorcerous fire or heat. Targets only take 1/4 the usual damage (rounded down) from flames or heat (see 10.4). This Eye provides no protection against such spells as Calcination, the Fist of Fire, or the Bolt of Imminent Immolation, although it does protect from secondary fires created by these spells. Diam: 3”; Ran: 3”; Dur: 3 minutes|
|1|**eye of voluminous translocation**|Excellent travelling volume|This eye surrounds 1–2 targets in a 1” diameter and within 3” in a protective force field and holds them in it for one round. During this time, the user can move the target(s) to any other location desired within the eye’s range. The distance between the user and target remains constant. The field is inertialess and very heavy objects can thus be moved. An object permanently affixed to a wall, floor, etc. cannot be targeted. Since the target has no inertia, it cannot be hurled; instead, it drops straight down when the round expires.|
|1|**eye of voluminous translocation**|(Gardasiyal)|This Eye surrounds targets in its area of effect who fail their Resistance Check with an inertia-less, protective force field and holds them in a force beam for 1 combat round (6 seconds). During this round, the user can move the target(s) to any other location he/she desires within the Eye's range. The distance between the user and the target remains constant. The field is inertia-less, and very heavy objects can thus be moved. An object permanently affixed to a wall, floor, etc. cannot be moved. Since a target has no inertia, it cannot be hurled: instead, it drops straight down when the 6 seconds expire. Diam: 1”; Ran: 6”, Dur: 1 round|
|1|**eye of wondrous preservation**||This Eye suspends the act of natural decomposition, putrefaction or decay, upon any non-living matter. It can be used therefore, to keep fruits, herbs, vegetables, meat or bodies, suspended until needed again. (It will not refresh rotting fruit/ meat however). It stops the Undead from regenerating though. It will also prevent the advance of decomposition, and the progression of certain offensive spells. Range = 100', duration = 24 hours, target area = a, area = 20' circle.|
|1|**horrible eye of disparate congealment**||(The inspiration for this Eye came from Prof. M.A.R. Barker’s “The Man of Gold”).<br><br>A limited number of these Eyes were created via the tinkering of an unfortunate scholar-priest of Thumis at the Monastery of the Grey Cloak in the Chaka Forests. It affects a 1 foot (max) targeted area (range = 30'), “melting” all material of organic or inorganic material, and ‘refusing’ it again equally together …. [On an atomic level – ever seen The Fly No. II movie ??]. If used carelessly upon a living target (Say “un-aimed”), then roll for a random body location, and the nearest surface or contacted object (A warrior might have a part of his armour permanently bonded to his flesh). The victim may even find their feet permanently bonded to the floor where they are standing (!). There is no known reversal for this effect (besides amputation of the affected part). If a hit occurs upon a vital area, then this would become invariably fatal (ie: face ‘melts’ and then solidifies into an intermingled mess …It would be amusing to have a warrior’s helmet permanently bonded upon his skull though?).<br><br>The original creator of this Eye spent the remainder of his Lifetime permanently bonded to the stone floor of his study room ….by the hip-joint where he fell. His fused bones are still shown to Temple initiates as a lesson in experimental folly. The Priesthood of Hru’u would perhaps show an interest in the acquisition of this Eye, but may possibly become incensed by anyone who is seen using this Eye, since it very closely duplicates a portion of their ‘Viscosity’ (Temple Spell #115) spell. [The Eye however does make an excellent ‘glue-gun’!].|
|2|**incomparable eye of command**|(Source Book)|This Eye turns all targets in a 3-yard radius into slaves as for the Command spell for 10 minutes. SS 12, Acc +2, Max 60.<br><br>This device gives the user crude control over targets who fail their Resistance Check. These can be ordered to flee, fight against their friends, or remain immobile for the duration of the effect. They cannot be made to perform more complex tasks. Diam: 5”; Ran: 24”; Dur: 10 minutes|
|2|**ineluctable eye of healing**|(Source Book)|This Eye casts the Cure Serious Wounds spell on the subject. Roll 2d for the number of ST healed. It can cure blindness and deafness caused by magic or injury. This device may also be used instead of a ST roll for either poison or disease but must be used before the roll is attempted. This Eye has a range of 3 yards, with no range modifiers.<br><br>This Eye heals all physical damage sustained by one target from wounds or hostile magic. It does not act upon genetic defects or deformities or restore lost body parts, nor does it heal the ravages of disease, drugs, poison, gas, starvation, or thirst. If this Eye is operating properly, no die roll is needed to perform this healing. Diam: 1 target|
|1|**slaver Llérgo's eye of irresistible tranquility**|(Gardasiyal)|This strange device causes beings within its circle of effect who fail a Resistance Check to lose courage and/or physical strength for 8/11/14 minutes. A d10 is rolled for each target:<br><br>1- 2 = the victim no longer wants to fight or perform strenuous activities but loses nothing else;<br><br>3-4 = the target's armor and weapons become limp and as soft as cheese for 2/3/4 combat rounds;<br><br>5-6 = the target loses 2 points from his/her PHYS for the duration of the Eye's effect;<br><br>7-8 = the target loses both PHYS and weapons (as for a result of 3-4 and 5-6);<br><br>9 = the target yearns only for peace, will not fight or run away, and will become subservient to the Eye's user until a spell of Disenchantment is successfully cast;<br><br>10 = the target becomes permanently comatose and can only be restored by a spell or Eye of Healing. Diam: 3”; Ran: 12”|
|2|**splendid eye of Kra the Mighty**|(Source Book)|Targets in the area of effect are seized by an invisible vice of psychic force, as though by great pincers. Affected targets suffer 8/11/14 damage, with no armor protection. Secondary targets who successfully resist still take damage but their armor applies. This Eye also performs actions requiring a single burst of great strength: e.g. smash open a stout door, break down a wall, etc. Inanimate targets get only ½ the normal benefit of their Material Strength (round down; see 10.5) if partially affected, none if fully affected. Diam: 1”; Ran: 12”|
|1|**splendid eye of seeking far adventures**|(Gardasiyal)|The user and other beings within the circle of effect are unceremoniously hurled into another plane, as selected by the GM. These planes are never instantly fatal (i.e. they do not open into outer space, the heart of a sun, solid rock, etc.), but they are likely to be very distant from the world of Tékumel. A Resistance Check is allowed to anyone who does not wish to be transported. The Eye must be fired again, or a powerful spell must be cast, to find the interplanar road back. Targets are transported with only those possessions worn or kept in pouches or backpacks; all else is left behind. Diam. 3”; Ran: 3”|
|2|**terrible eye of raging power**|(Gardasiyal)|This Eye unleashes a devastating ranged energy attack on a target, and any vaporises any target in the cone of effect (6m cone at 20m range). If there is no target, there is a small risk the effect will rebound on the user!<br><br>("Target" = anything with enough magical signal to be considered alive, undead, or an automaton)|
|2|**terrible eye of raging power**|(Source Book)|This Eye projects a beam of electricity, electrocuting targets within the area of effect who fail a Resistance Check. Their possessions are destroyed, and only arms and armor of enchanted steel are not damaged, although straps, padding, etc., are incinerated. If there is insufficient space for the beam to extend out to its full range, it rebounds towards the user and may harm him/her, ricochet off nearby iron objects, etc. Diam: 3”; Ran: 12”|
|0.5|**thoroughly useful eye**|(Source Book)|This Eye is capable of recharging Eyes and certain other ancient devices: one charge can be restored to one device per day. Both items are placed iris to iris, and the Thoroughly Useful Eye's firing stud is depressed. One charge is immediately restored; another is regained each day by leaving the two items together. The Thoroughly Useful Eye itself never needs recharging. This is the rarest of all Eyes; only four specimens are known in the Tsolyáni Empire and two in other lands. Thus, if this Eye is randomly rolled, the GM rolls a d10 as a confirming roll: 1-8 = the GM must re-roll or choose another Eye; 9-10 = a Thoroughly Useful Eye is indeed found.|
|3|**wonderful culinary eye**||This Eye converts any harvested flora (not connected to the earth), or non-living (e.g.: ‘slaughtered’) fauna, into an appetising, presentable and appealing cooked meal (as interpreted by the modern tastes of the Ancient Spacefarers). It was commonly used as a ‘labour-saving’ kitchen convenience.<br><br>The targeted item or area (3' circle or a maximum of one being of size M or smaller) will momentarily vanish, to re-appear some few Sivel later—sliced, cooked, crumbed, basted (or whatever!), and tastefully presented upon a series of appropriate plain white ceramic platters. Unforeseen effects upon Current Tékumel will be that it will now convert also Undead creatures (eg: Mrur) of previously organic natures (‘non-living’), into a cooked, sauced and sliced ‘meal’ as well (Destroying them unless a MRF Roll vs Level 20 is made). The Eye will not affect live fauna or uncut (growing) flora, automatons or non-corporeal creatures.|

That’s It ! I hope that some of these provoke some creativity and amusement for All. Now—the Tékumel GM may decide upon the Standard or Extended List (here). Ohe! Thankyou Professor Barker (Phil) for your amazingly interesting World of Tékumel, as worthy of preservation as ‘The Scrolls of Pavar’. Martin Gibbs / Mike Bell / 2009.
