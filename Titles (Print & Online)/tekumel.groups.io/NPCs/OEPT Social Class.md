Social Class, Skills and Races in OEPT  
  
I know some of you will think I am needlessly spoiling the pristine simplicity of OEPT with these suggestions, but IMO the social system of Tsolyánu is a very important aspect of the setting and needs some recognition in character generation. The system I am proposing will also give more variation between characters, and a modicum of ‘realism’ should you be interested in such things.  
  
Each character draws skills not just from the professional skills list (OEPT page 20) but has a social class based list as well; this replaces the ‘Original Skills’ list on p18 and the rules for gaining more on p421. Some skill levels may be vacant, others may have more than one possible skill. PCs may still acquire training in original skills from clan masters at a suitable fee, and having sufficient social status will of course help wangle this at a reasonable cost.  
  
You no longer need all the previous skills on a list to gain the next one, and you must take one skill from the social class table at first level. When gaining levels through experience you gain +1 skill per level from any table your PC qualifies for, with a 50% chance of gaining a second, and gain +1 max skill level. Thus if you start as a Nakomé warrior, each further level you can choose from the Nakomé list or the warrior list as you gain skills. If you join a clan you get access to the appropriate clan level list instead of Nakomé.  
  
Priests and Sorcerers must be at least semi-literate; if this means spending an initial skill on this talent, so be it; if you do not have high enough stats to access the skill at your clan level, you don't get into the temple school and you are relegated to being a warrior despite your potential; caste systems can be wasteful of talent.

Using skills

Most of the time the GM can simply say the possession of a skill enables a PC to do a given task, but from time to time it may be appropriate to roll a skill check to see if a PC has succeeded. The base chance of success depends on how difficult the task is (duh!), the PCs level and a bonus for having a good score in a stat that might be relevant.

Base chance of success = 35% +5% per level with skill

0% + 3% per level with no skill

Difficulty mod = +50% (doddle) to -50% or even more (heroically hard) depending on assessment and/or whim of GM

Stat mod = (Stat-50 /4) to give +/- 12%

Opposed skills – each person rolls highest score that is still a success wins.

Examples:

Arjan the Gladiator (Level 3 Warrior) has a bout coming up against Yuth the N’lüss. Wanting to know how good this huge foreign oaf is he asks about in the usual gambling dens – the GM allows him to use his Streetwise skill – 35+15 = 50% - rates the task as hard as few people in town have seen Yuth fight - -20% - and allows Arjan to use his Guile of 63 to help – (63-50)/4 = +3% = 33%.

Arjan rolls 52 – he cannot find out anything about this guy. If he had rolled very high, the GM could have decided that he had failed so badly he got false information.

Still looking for an edge, Arjan sneaks into Yuth’s training yard. No stealth skill so Lev 3x 3 = 9%, average task 0% bonus and using 78 Dex for +7% bonus = 16%. He rolls 18; as he tries to nip in through a door he is spotted, recognised and told to go away in no uncertain terms.

He finally gets to see the man fight at an exhibition bout at a nobleman’s banquet, and tries to spot any weaknesses. Gladiator skill applies at 50%, hard task for -10% and Intelligence of 40 gives -3%; total 37%. He rolls 30% - Arjan reckons that though the barbarian’s wild N’lüss claymore style is terrifying and brutal a quick man with a shortsword could nip in under one of his wild swings and deal him a death blow.

And finally the bout. Each man sizes the other up and Yuth swings, looking for a quick decapitation; Arjan spots his chance and dives in… Each rolls on his Swordsman skill – Yuth uses his Intelligence as a bonus to see if he spots the ploy. Base success for a Level 4 Warrior is 55%, he has an Int of 30 for -5%, he rolls 27, succeeding. Arjan is using Swordsman skill with Guile as a bonus 50% +3% = 53%. He rolls 37, also succeeding, and as he got higher than Yuth he has the advantage – The GM awards him +2 to hit for this round, but with Yuth on his guard any further attempt at such feints on Arjan’s part will be at a penalty. The shortsword jabs at Yuth’s wide leather belt as the claymore whistles just over his head; this blow had better count…

Literacy Skills

There are three levels of literacy skill.

Illiterates cannot work out what is going on in any piece of written information except the most obvious and literal hieroglyphics.

Semi-Literate people know a script well enough to make out what it says most of the time. Roll Intelligence as a %age or as if Literacy was an ordinary skill, which ever is higher, whenever they need to read a document or inscription, but they will suffer modifiers if the script is unclear, poetic rather than straightforward, or archaic, cryptic, uses fancy calligraphy and flowery phrases as many Palace documents do etc. People may be semi-literate in more than one language.

Literate people automatically read most writings in the script and a document must be pretty obscure or fragmentary to force them to roll. They can use their literacy skill to try and fathom out codes and ciphers, read ‘Classic’ forms of the same tongue and glean partial meanings from documents in similar scripts they don’t know. A person who could read Engsvanyáli script could have stab at reading Tsolyáni, Mu’ugalavyáni and Livyáni for example, if he knew the spoken languages.

Gaining Stats

Religious Lists

All PCs also have access to skill list related to their religion. Anyone can access this but many skills are limited to just priests and/or sorcerers.

The following also includes dress/weapon restrictions for each deity. This is an attempt to reconcile the OEPT limitation on armour and weaponry with Mitlányal and other publications on Tsolyáni religion and includes much that is non-canon; feel free to ignore this.

Optional rules:

Casting spells in armour

Priests and sorcerers may use armour and shields of any kind, but this does severely restrict their ability to cast spells.

Leather -25% success

Chain -50% success

Plate -75% success

Helmet -10% success

Shield -15% success

Steel and magical feedback

Carrying metals while casting spells in NOT a good idea. The magical energies drawn through from the other side are severely warped and absorbed by the metal and become powerful jolts of electrical energy. This includes the spare change in a priest’s purse, and any gold rings and chains. Most such gaudy accoutrements used by a magician are thinly gilded wood and Chlén hide, and he usually has his guards carry the loot. One Káitar weighs 3 grams.

Weight

0-100Kt Pain only

100- 200Kt 1 dice

200 – 400Kt Dagger 2 dice

400 - 800Kt Shortsword 3 dice

800-1600Kt Sword, 1H hand weapon 4 dice

1600 -3200Kt 5 dice

3200-6400Kt Chainmail 6 dice

Etc.

Add 1 dice for a Professional skill of Level 3-6 or a Group 1 spell, 2 dice for skills level 7-9 of a group II spell and 4 dice for skills of 10+ and Group III spells.

The only exceptions to this are the odd enchanted non-ferrous metals used by certain temples for ritual purposes, such as Sárku’s copper knives and Ksárul’s silver gilded masks.

Only priests of Karakán and Vimúhla tend to be loopy enough to take the risk of using magic while armed with steel. The priests of Karakán in particular love the tooth loosening high-voltage jolt and try and stab their swords into enemies as it arrives in order to slay hated foes in a suitably spectacular fashion..

Bright sparks (pun intended) who think they can avoid this problem with suitable insulation won’t get far. The personal magic aura of a human extends about a foot from the body, and up to two feet around the head and it is the field as a whole that is electrified. People wearing metal items standing next a sorcerer should not get too close. Rumours of the existence of a Blessed Ankle-Chain of Earthing that will drain the charge harmlessly into the soil have proved baseless.

All Priests and Sorcerers now have the option to go for the following skills –

1

2 Scribe (PS) – as Professional skill

3 Sacrifice (P) – Can officiate at ceremonies in a suitable temple and ask his blessing in return for suitable sacrifices (eg white flowers for Hnálla, burnt flesh for Vimúhla etc.). These can gain +1-6% one use ‘luck’ bonus, which lasts a week (or a month if made on a holy day). The cost of the sacrifice is at the GMs discretion, but high level and wealthy PCs will be expected to pay a lot.

If made on behalf of another, the priest gets to keep 10% of the value of the sacrifice.

4 Public Ritual (P) – Can bless weddings, funerals and other public devotions and ceremonies. 90% of the fee must go to the Temple, but still a decent source of income for many priests (+2d100 x Level Kt/Month average), Requires Comeliness 60+.

5 Power sacrifice (S) – Sorcerer can make sacrifices to increase chances of a spell working. This can only be used as part of a long ritual, so using this skill is impossible in combat, and usually only used when creating magic items. The bonus is up to 15% on the chances of a spell working, depending on value of sacrifice. Sacrifices for Group III spells are vastly more expensive than those for Group I or for professional abilities.

6

7 Exorcist (S) – Demons and spirits of unquiet dead do occasionally trouble the public of Tsolyánu, and even more likely is the use of paid sorcerers to cast spells and curses on one’s enemies. The professional Exorcist counters all that, and can earn 5d100Kt x Level/Month, or even more if retained by a noble clan as a magical bodyguard/advisor. Requires Psychic Ability 80+ and Medium skill.

8

9

10 Inscription (PS) – Can make scrolls of spells known, which will work at the usual chance of success the priest/sorcerer has of casting them. Level I-III can make scrolls for professional skill type magic, level IV-VI scrolls for Type I spells, Levels VII-X Type II spells, Level XI+ Type III spells. It is usual practice to use ancient and/or secret languages for higher level spells, and a person foolish enough to inscribe a high level ritual in ordinary Tsolyáni may well be disciplined by his temple. Takes 1 week, requires Full Literacy in language used, Scribe skill and 5000Kt per ‘level’ of spell inscribed.

11 Create Talisman (P) – A precious sign of the favour of a deity, these vary considerably in form and function, but as a rule of thumb they add 10% to the chances of success in certain skills or spells or +1 AC or +1 to hit against certain foes of the deity. They are very expensive to make, 20,000Kt+ and the enchantment rituals can take a month or more, and are usually supplemented by sacrifices to improve chances of success.

12

Hnálla

Priests and Sorcerers of Hnálla are required to avoid contact with blood or become ritually polluted. They may only use flails, maces and warhammers but can use shields. If they do come into contact with blood, even by accident and even if using Physician skill or a healing magic, they lose 10% on their chance to cast magic and cannot officiate at rituals and blessings until they can get to a temple and make a suitable sacrifice. They cannot butcher meat themselves, and the meat must be prepared according to certain ritual requirements. Even laymen sometimes follow these restrictions on behaviour, even though they do not suffer any magical penalty. Each subsequent pollution reduces the chance of magic working by a further 5%. Chaplains in Hnálla worshipping military units spend a lot of time purifying their flocks and persuading the deity to forgive the mayhem they have wreaked on his ineffably ordered universe.

Worshippers of Hnálla frequently consider themselves a cut above the common amoral herd of humanity, and GM may exact larger than usual penalties if such a person is caught doing something dishonourable, requiring serious penances, long periods of fasting and even excommunicating them in serious cases.

The Temple of Hnálla regards fasting as meritorious. Any ritual or blessing is usually preceded by a fast, and priests willing to risk their health with prolonged fasting can gain blessings from the deity.

1

2

3 Effulgent Radiance (PS) – As Group I light spell and can be used to blind 1-6 opponents

4 Righteousness – Known as an upstanding and honourable citizen of his/her class, extra bonus in dealing with social situations (can be lost through dishonourable action)

5 Peaceful Repose (PS) – A spell that enables the target to resist nightmares and other psychic attacks while asleep. If attacked physically, he is awakened beforehand and cannot be surprised. Usable once/day on one target.

6 The Power of Ultimate Perfection (P) – Can dismiss a summoned creature or demon. At level I this affects 1-3 HD worth of creatures, at level III it affects 2-4HD, at level V affects 3-5HD and so on. The spell has no save, the creature(s) is dismissed instantly.

7 Artfulness (S) - +10% success in any skill roll for one turn, requires sacrifice of a white flower.

8 The Ritual of the Purified Sphere (P) – As for Protection of Evil, but +2 on saves vs evil and -4 points from damage dice. At Level IV it will totally exclude beings summoned or created by evil magic as well as undead, at Level VII it will exclude evil Priests and Sorcerers as well.

9 Fully Literate in Thu’úsa (PS)

10 Light of Glorious Truth – Bonus when resisting Guile of others, can detect lies, +1 Save vs Illusions; requires long membership in good standing of the temple and at least a 5000Kt value diamond as a sacrifice.

Sect of Chiráshin Tuléngkoi (P) – Must always go naked and wear at least 5000Kt worth of diamonds and crystals. May cure insanity once per day, serious wounds once per day and cure fear in 2d6 individuals once per day.

Sect of Jérmochusùn (P) - +15% chance of casting spells while wearing armour , +2 levels in attack chance and damage when fighting undead.

11 Halo of His Sheltering Arm - +1 save vs any magic cast by an evil priest or sorcerer, +1 AC vs any physical assault by an evil creature or warrior; requires long membership in good standing of the temple and at least a 10,000Kt value diamond as a sacrifice.

12 Fulguration of Imminent Grandeur (S) Creates a blast of intense light that incinerates all within a radius of 20 feet who fail their save and does 6d6 damage to those who save. (Replaces The Grey Hand)

Drá

Priests and Sorcerers of Drá are required to avoid blood or become ritually polluted. They may only use flails, maces and warhammers but can use shields. If they do come into contact with blood, even by accident and even if using Physician skill or a healing magic, they lose 10% on their chance to cast magic and cannot officiate at rituals and blessings until they can get to a temple and make a suitable sacrifice. Each subsequent pollution reduces the chance of magic working by a further 5%. They cannot butcher meat themselves, and the meat must be prepared according to certain ritual requirements.

Supporting the Perfect of Drá financially is a duty for all priests and sorcerers. They are expected to give 10% of any income to the temple for this purpose, preferably more, and may be penalised in the spells the Temple is willing to teach if they lack enthusiasm for giving their own wealth and raising cash from others.

The Temple of Drá regards fasting as meritorious. Any ritual or blessing is usually preceded by a fast, and priests willing to risk their health with prolonged fasting can gain blessings from the deity.

1

2

3 Stoicism – The person accepts whatever their Skein of Destiny throws at them with equanimity and can use Psychic Ability score to resist attempts to insult them or make them succumb to strong emotions.

4 Apathy (PS) – Useable on the caster himself and makes him immune to mind controlling magics of any kind.

5 Meditation Upon the Sun – If the person spends an hour contemplating the bright disc of the sun they gain +1d6% Luck bonus for use in any circumstance that day, and relief from mental troubles and fears. Requires 1000Kt in donations to the Temple to learn.

6

7 Simplicity – Person appears to be slow-witted and bland in character, but gets +2 save vs mind affecting magic, +1AC vs evil opponents, can dispel illusions once per day and gets +20 Guile when resisting the Guile of others attempting to deceive him. Cannot have Int more than 30.

8 Hymn of the Lord of Light (P) – As Protection from Evil, but in addition evil targets may flee from the caster. At Level I-V any undead that see the caster run away in fear with no save, at Level VI+ Demons, phantasms and hostile animals flee.

9 Fully Literate in Thu’úsa (PS)

10 Endless Song of Praise (P) – causes the target to endlessly sing the praises of Hnálla, whatever their faith and wherever they are. The spell lasts 1 hour per level of the caster, though the target does get a save vs magic per hour of singing. Each hour does 1d6 damage in exhaustion and reduces the targets Strength by 1d10, and while singing the person cannot cast spells or recite them from scrolls or communicate normally. The spell also reduces their chance to hit by 1 during the first hour, 2 during the second and so on. If cast on worshippers of Hnálla or Drá, such as a unit of Temple guards or a temple sponsored legion, it will give +1 to hit for the first hour, 0 in the second, -1 in the third and so on and immunity to morale checks, though the caster must save vs magic per hour to be able to end the spell before severe exhaustion sets in and his troops collapse.

11 Holy Fool – Person loses interest in material wealth donating all cash to the Temple of Drá. Becomes immune to mind control magic, able to prophesy once per day and gets +1d6% per day luck bonus automatically.

12 Risibility (S) The targets within a 10ft radius realise the utter futility and ridiculousness of existence and are overcome by laughter. There is no save, and after 3 combat rounds of hysterics they collapse and die unless disenchanted. (Replaces The Grey Hand)

Thúmis

Priests and Sorcerers of Thúmis may use only blunt weapons and daggers and this deity has a notably non-violent and pacifistic bent. It is considered pollution for a priest or sorcerer of Thúmis to initiate personal violence in any form - though they do order their temple guards to rough people up on their behalf, it is usually with expressions of great regret that they cannot come to a reasonable and logical solution. This limitation does not include animals and beasts of the underworld, but does include intelligent non-humans, even inimicals. Most Thúmis priests accept that the inimical species are utterly and implacably hostile to humans and don’t waste much time negotiating before using the military option, but some fanatics of the temple have martyred themselves trying to spread the sweet reason of the Pearl Grey Lord to hordes of demented Hlutrgú and the like.

Thúmis also regards fasting as meritorious, and will precede major rituals and tests of knowledge and sagacity with a fast. Again in extreme and possibly health damaging cases, blessings can be wrested from the deity in return for self-denial.

Scholarship is very important to Thúmis; at each level of the Temple hierarchy there are examinations to be passed and theses to be written. No person who is not fully literate can learn Temple skills above level 6, and priests and sorcerers will not be able to learn Professional skills above level 6 either, and will not be taught Group II and II spells. To gain access to Group III skills or professional skills above level 9 a priest or sorcerer must have at least one scholar skill.

1

2 Semi-Literacy – Even the children of peasants are instructed by the teachers of Thúmis in return for small sacrifices and donations in kind. Costs 50Kt.

3 Fully Literate – Free to priests and sorcerers, a more thorough grounding in Tsolyáni language and literacy costs laymen 200Kt to learn.

4 Foreign Language – the Temple of Thúmis is especially proud of its Linguistic scholarship and will teach modern foreign languages to anyone with 2000Kt for the course.

Benignity (PS) – a spell that makes hostile creatures or persons temporarily friendly and amenable to negotiation. Usable once per day on 2d6 creatures and functions on people and intelligent nonhumans without saving throw. Inimical species get a save and can never be more than malevolently neutral. Effectively adds +10 to reaction rolls (see sect. 1020 of rulebook) per level of caster, lasts 3 turns, and if success in oratory/etiquette/negotiation etc is achieved during this time, reaction may be permanently improved.

5 Education – Anyone who follows Thúmis from the highest to the lowest can wander the corridors of the temple and hear lessons and lectures being conducted by the wise priests of the temple. Those with money to spend can learn much of the ways of the world. Requires that a person be at least semi-literate, and paying 2000Kt increases Intelligence by 1d6, +1 per further 2000Kt, half price for Priests and Sorcerers. Confers full literacy in one modern or classical language, and gives a small chance of answering any question of scholarship.

Scholar (PS) – Clergy of Thúmis are expected to have extensive knowledge of at least one academic subject. Can learn the highly useful Linguistics skill, which gives a person some chance of fathoming almost any human language.

Librarian (P) – Allows a priest to more easily access the often chaotic and disorganised Temple libraries and confers a reasonable knowledge of where to look for information on a given subject throughout the Empire and occasionally beyond. Knowledge of the contents of other Temple’s libraries can be a bit sketchy or just rumours. Also includes the valuation of books and scrolls and the use of the spell Preserver of Wisdom three times a day. This makes a scroll proof to ordinary fires, partially tearproof and marks it as Thúmis temple property to the security demons used by the librarians to prevent theft via nexus point.

6 Teacher (PS) – a profession followed by many clergy and scholars in the Temple, ranging from those who sit over hot schoolrooms of children with a switch to those who tutor the wealthy in the higher aesthetics of the arts on cool verandas over a glass of wine. Requires Full Literacy plus Education or at least one Scholar skill and Int 80+. Earns 2d100 per level per month, +2d100 per extra Scholar skill or modern foreign language.

7 Sagacity (S) – trebles Intelligence bonus to any single skill roll, requires sacrifice of a grey flower or a Tsévu fruit.

8 Dedaratl (PS) – Only learnable by those of Str 50+ and Dex 80+, this is an unarmed combat technique which enables a user to attack as if they were +1 Level using a variety of nasty kicks and throws. Can only be used unarmoured, but adds +2 to effective AC through dodging. Very rarely taught to Warriors, and then only to special agents of the Temple.

9 Fully Literate in Thu’úsa (PS)

10

11 Discerner of Enchantments (P) - This highly useful ability enables the caster to determine the characteristics of any spell cast on any target and make a basic analysis of its properties. Three times a day it can be used to detect magic within 60 feet and whether such magic is harmful, related to which deity etc, and has a chance of detecting who the caster was, when it was cast etc. Or once per week a caster can investigate a magic item such as an eye determining its alignment, function and charges without risk. The degree of success depends on a skill roll using Psychic Ability as a bonus.

12 Gate of the Grey Pentacle (S) – replaces the Grey Hand. This spell creates a whirling grey nexus point which will suck in one person per round until disenchanted or until it has taken 1d3 victims per level of caster. Targets are allowed a save, but if they fail they are sent to a plane of existence far, far away and by no means necessarily able to support sentient life for any length of time. If they succeed in their save they may be targeted again next round if the caster so wishes, though they can try and use Dexterity to avoid the whirling mass. It is possible to return to Tékumel from such places, or even be rescued by a sufficiently skilful sorcerer, but such cases are countable on the fingers of one (human) hand. Cannot be cast at all by persons of Level I-VI, can be used once a week by those of Level VII-XII and once every three days by those of level XIII-XIV, daily by XV+.

Keténgku

Priests and Sorcerers of Keténgku may use only blunt weapons and daggers and this deity has a notably non-violent and pacifistic bent. It is considered pollution for a priest or sorcerer of Keténgku to initiate personal violence in any form - though they do order their temple guards to rough people up on their behalf, it is usually with expressions of great regret that they cannot come to a reasonable and logical solution. This limitation does not include animals and beasts of the underworld, but does include intelligent non-humans, even inimicals. Most Keténgku priests accept that the inimical species are utterly and implacably hostile to humans and don’t waste much time negotiating before using the military option, but some fanatics of the temple have martyred themselves trying to spread the sweet reason of the Pearl Grey Lord to hordes of demented Hlutrgú and the like.

Keténgku also regards fasting as meritorious, and will precede major rituals and tests of knowledge and sagacity with a fast. Again in extreme and possibly health damaging cases, blessings can be wrested from the deity in return for self-denial.

Example characters

**Tnaka Illakma** is a Nakomé barbarian from Kilalámmu. His initial stats are:

Str 40 Int 72 Con 83 PsyAb 43 Dex 25 Com 37 Gui 56

He cannot be a priest, even though intelligence is his highest stat. He is illiterate, but his Int would only give him a maximum skill level of 4 and Semi-Literacy is a level 6 skill for barbarians.

He ends up as a warrior, and he isn’t especially good at it; he has a maximum skill level of 3, though he rolls 76 and ends up with 5 skills.

He chooses as his initial skills: Speak Tsolyani, Hunter and Labourer from the barbarian list and Spearman and Axeman from the Warrior list.

He gains from these skills +7 Str, +3 Con, +9 Dex, -5 Int, -3 Com and -4 Guile and now has:

Str 47 Int 69 Con 91 PsyAb 43 Dex 34 Com 34 Gui 52

We see Tnaka as an ambitious young barbarian fresh from the hills. He is a bit scrawny but tough; he can hunt, he has worked long and hard in the meagre fields of his mountain village and picked up enough Tsolyáni from the passing peddlers to think he can make it in the soft valleys below, especially if he takes his axe with him. He is interested in the gods, but the significance of the squiggly lines the Tsolyáni use as oracles evades him.

He survives long enough to gain a level, rolling 85 to gain stats and choosing +5 Dexterity to bring it up to 39; he is still clumsy, but improving. He rolls 84 on his skill gain roll – he gets two skills and can now get up to skill level 4. He also in the meantime joined the Temple of Hnálla, giving him access to the Hnálla Temple skill list. He takes the skill Swordsman from the Warrior list and the skill Righteousness from the Hnálla list. Despite being a foreign Nakomé scumbag people are recognising Tnaka as an honourable and dependable person with an acute sense of right and wrong. He can get work as a body guard, and the temple will recommend him to merchants and minor gentry as a dependable and hard worker; carrying the noble sword rather than the déclassé axe will improve his chances of work as well.

At third level he rolls 34 for stat gain, getting nothing, and 16 on his skill roll gaining one skill, but can get up to a level 5 skill. He chooses the level 4 Streetwise skill from the barbarian list. He has been hanging around the Foreign Quarter long enough to know a few rogues and drinking holes here and there. While to his Tsolyáni acquaintances he is still dependable and loyal old Tnaka, he can put them in touch with murky people from the back alleys if they ask him to and can spot wrong ‘uns and divert them from bothering his well-heeled charges by quietly reminding them that he knows where they live and goes to the same temple as many city magistrates.

At fourth level he again gains no stats (roll12) but does get two skills (roll 99), and can choose level 6 skills. He chooses Slinger from the Warrior list and Semi-Literate. He has made himself indispensable to various Merchants who need a man they can trust to guard them when they plunge into the Jakállan Foreign Quarter in search of cheap deals on certain hard to come by goods. He, in return, is picking up reading and writing and is using discrete written notes and letters to communicate with them and is acting as their agent.

At fifth level he gains no stats again (32) and gets one skill up to level 7 (44). He chooses Merchant, now accessible to him as he has learned to read. He has graduated to trading on his own behalf – his knowledge of both the white and black markets has served him well, and as long as he doesn’t take too many risks with his hard won reputation for honour and probity he is intelligent enough to do well. Not bad for a youth who came to the city unable to read and with only an axe to his name.

**Osul hiGuruté** is of the middle ranking Yellow Plume clan. His stats are:

Str 06 Int 86 Con 41 PsyAb 90 Dex 55 Com 75 Gui 26

This weedy and bookish youth is an obvious candidate for the priesthood or maybe a sorcerer. He chooses the priesthood of the Temple of Thúmis, his initial skill level is 5 and he gains 3 skills. His first skill is Clerk from the Middle clan list, he takes Full Literacy from the Thúmis list and Produce Light. He gains +7 Int and -4 Str from long hours spent poring over his clan’s business papers. Note that his Int is now 93 – this makes his initial skill level 6, and when he increases in level it will be 7; his Str is however 2; you will not find a more useless warrior, he has the physique of a millennium old Mrúr with none of the dried out toughness.

His sharpness means he rises to level II very quickly (his Int gives +10% experience); he gains +2 on his Guile (random rolls), he is slightly less naïve than he was, but the other novices in his dormitory still have many a laugh at his expense. He gains 2 skills (84 rolled) and can have level 7 skills. He chooses ESP from the Priest list, and Public Ritual from the Extra Priest list. He looks pretty clever and fearsomely ascetic without being scary (Com 75), just the kind of ‘front man’ the Temple of Thúmis likes, and gets a job conducting rituals. He earns 2d100 x2 a month = (79+46) x 2 = 250Kt. He rolls 69 on his roll to get bonus spells, learning none. He gets a few invites to go on adventuring expeditions; a guy who can produce light and see through walls is pretty useful, and he can now afford to hire a cheap bodyguard or two.

At level III he gets no more stats, two more skills and no spells (09!). His max skill is now 8, and his salary goes up by 2d100Kt, giving him (250 + 98) = 348Kt month. He gets the Scholar skill, learning Archaeology and becoming semi-literate in Bednálljan, and the Protection for Evil skill. He is spending a lot of time poking around the tsuru’úm, deciphering ancient inscriptions and using his magical abilities to ward off evil beasts. He is sometimes required to go into the deep secret shrines of the Temple to perform rituals, hence the danger money.

At Level IV he gets +4 Dex (random roll), one skill max level 9 and one spell of Group III (95 roll!). He chooses Benignity from the Temple list and the spell Energy Bolt. He is now armed with powerful magic and very dangerous. If the beasts of the underworld cannot be persuaded to see reason with the Benignity spell, then they had better beware. He also gain 2d100Kt = 100Kt in income, bringing him up to 448Kt

At Level V he gains no stats, but does get two skills of max level 10 and another Group III spell. He chooses Wealth from the Middle clan list, Teacher from the Temple list. The Wealth skill means he has invested cash in his clan business and now earns 5x2d100 = 490Kt month, he earns 5 x (2d100) = 435Kt as a teacher passing on his knowledge of Archaeology plus he gains 2d100 to his income from being a Ritualist = 448+73 = 522Kt. In total he now gains 1447Kt a month, a tidy sum; he has bought a number of slaves and retains a number of research assistants, some heavily armed, for his archaeological expeditions. He also learns the Group III spell Shield of Defence; most useful in warding off monstrous beings in the lower levels of the underworld. The nerd is making good.
