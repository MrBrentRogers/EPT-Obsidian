    Chói spread all over the empire. The integration of Pé Chói into human society has  
    been going on for thousands of years. This clan was recognized by the ruler of Béy  
    Sǘ during the “Time of No Kings” over 2,000 years ago. The Long Tails came to  
    Tumíssa about 1,000 years ago and are regarded as medium status there. Many members  
    have served as Nipw-nchopk and a few have served as Tii-petk for the Pé Chói  
    district. The members are equally divided between Change and Stability, and, unlike  
    their country cousins, they are not deeply religious. They all get along fine though  
    there is friction between those who join the priesthoods of human temples. Their  
    rivals as the leading Pé Chói clan in the Tumíssa area are the Dkik-dsa-ke clan,  
    many who are members of the legion of the same name as well as dedicated followers  
    of Hnálla. In Yi'ita, outside of Tumíssa, the Long Tails have one small clan house  
    with 15 members who all work as civil servants in the Palace of the Realm.

gear and squat cross-legged on mats of scuffed red fabric. Boys scuttle to and  
fro with trays of sweetmeats and beverages; older youths pull cords of sweep-fans

Spinning Sphere of Gold and the Seven Tiered Mansion in Sra'ón.  
Sra'ón- Municipal color is a light yellow. Gray-green stone walls, ocher-tiled roofs, and  
intricately carved gables march off to the horizon, among which the gilded spires  
of the temples of the dread Shadow Gods thrust up into the smoke-daubed sky. The  
harbor is to the west of the city, a slate-hued, shallow bay. North, along the mud-  
flats, is the maze of tacky houses and shops that make up the Foreigner's Quarter.  
To the north-east, turrets, bastions, and tiled domes hang against the mist-blued  
sky, while further north, almost out of sight even on the clearest of clear days,  
the headlands of Kakársha Bay fade into indigo distances.

Vrú'uneb colors are green and purple, and their seals are blood-scarlet in hue. Their  
cells are called palláz.  
Vrú'uneb- The most efficient security force in the Five Empires. Each of the 13 temples  
contributes personnel, money, and goods to the central government in Tsámra,  
which thus supports the Vrú'uneb. Everything in Livyánu dances to the tune of the  
temples, and everyone must belong to one of the temples with most being members of  
the Vrú'uneb on one level or another. Few are exempt from spying upon their  
neighbors, and the organization is divided into cells with only the cell leader  
knowing the members as well as the leader of the cells above and below. Every member  
of a cell is ranked (5th of 20), and the smaller the number of people in a cell, the  
more powerful as well as the closer to the top it is.

Ajján: Coastal city (S&G Map 3) just outside the Chadára Protectorate is a typical  
Salarvyáni coastal city/town. The coast nearby is studded with enchanted Stelea to  
repel pirate attacks. The walls are in good repair, and the town within has narrow  
streets, elaborately decorated buildings as well as the noticeable odor of human  
bodies, strong pomades, and baking raw sewage. There is a frowning fortress where  
the ruling family (the Khelantikesh) resides, over looking the walls, but a long  
arrow shot within; they are strongly tied to the Chruggílléshmu family of

Tsatsayágga. Townsfolk bustle about their business, and curious children follow  
travelers if they enter the town. The ships of the Nchésh of the Sea Gray Wave visit  
frequently, recruiting personnel as well as taking on supplies and repairing their  
vessels so the dock and docking facilities are in good repair. Papers from the  
Chruggílléshmu are usually respected, but on the other hand, travelers from Jéggeth  
may be scrutinized as possible agents from the Gürrüshyúgga from Tsa'avtúlgu. There  
are some court factions that want closer ties with Tsa'avtúlgu.  
Akhána Nettles: Held by their long stalks and used as a whip to punish.  
Anjü: A spice used in eastern Salarvyá.

Salarvyá and their hide is not as durable.  
Eastern Salarvyá is not fertile ground for magic but also not barren.  
Eastern Salarvyá has a different language than western Salarvyá.  
Eastern Salarvyáni are not as hairy as western ones.  
Ebon Throne: When one refers to this they are referring to monarchy of the country. There  
is a throne (in the Tsolyáni sense) and it is ebon.  
Edhéka: A yellow flowering broad leaf tree that is unknown in Tsolyánu, but common in  
eastern Salarvyá.

The city is walled all around and guarded by a frowning fortress that rises  
behind the commercial district to overlook the harbor. Fearsome images of the  
Goddess Shiringgáyi guard the canal that leads from the sea to the thriving port  
district. Farther away several drum towers, with walls at least four man-heights  
thick, stand at the eastern and western approaches to the ridge behind the city. The  
Éngsvanyáli engineers had leveled the top of that ridge centuries ago and  
constructed a pillared pleasure palace of white marble and rose-red coral upon the  
highest pinnacle of the escarpment. Every corner and cranny of the Lord's dwelling  
is embellished with mosaics of gold and rare gems. The windows are single slabs of  
thin alabaster, each pierced with a thousand arabesques so dainty that they admit  
the light like a lace. In every niche stands a statue of a dignitary from the city's  
illustrious past. Every surface is a delight of tessellation and artful mosaic. Each  
chamber differs in its décor: some are faced with pink coral, others with polished  
turquoise to give the sense of being deep beneath the sea. The furnishings are of  
the rarest woods and the most costly fabrics.  
Great Salarvyáni dictionary written by the Priest Hórri. In that dictionary is the word

Hymn of the Verdant Land: celebrated on the 27th of Langála in Jækánta.  
Incest is common in eastern Salarvyá.  
In Tsa'avtúlgu instead of drawing power from the planes beyond, spells suck power into  
them causing “interesting” results.  
Jækánta: A kaleidoscope of pastel towers, arches, domes, walls, and lacy turrets made of  
Hládz, a porous limestone made of a myriad of tiny shells and marine creatures. It

is soft when dug up but hardens when exposed to air. The port of the city is up  
the Mriáz river which is protected by maroon colored towers with artillery atop  
them. Pink and pale green domes, dark scarlet towers, sky-blue turrets, white  
walls. A sea wall girds the Adamantine Pagoda, the port area.  
Jækantémmu: The Lords of the far eastern cities. They have 19 noble ranks with number 19  
being the highest. Rekhaddé-1st, Anjeddé-2nd, Diudde-3rd, Laghaddé-19th, Mbeggéhmu- the  
commander of all military forces in a province.

storehouses and fruit stands. It is a bright blue-green in color and is sacred to  
Shiringgáyi. A rapacious little beast. [DoK]  
Khomórg: Movement started by the Priestesshood of Shiringgáyi to over throw the existing  
order and establish a theocracy with themselves as the rulers. Its members were  
drawn from the disaffected, the downtrodden, and those who had nothing. They killed  
the upper classes, and practiced cannibalism.  
Lady Mrettén “She Who Walks on the Wind”.  
Legion of the Sea-Gray Wave.  
Many Salarvyáni children are taught from the beginning to guard their minds.  
Many Salarvyáni women know something of poisons especially the nobles.  
Mézh: A light wood found in eastern Salarvyá that is used to build ships.  
Mithudaré: A potent beverage in Eastern Salarvyá that rots the brain.  
Mmilláka is much more of a typical Salarvyáni city with bulbous domes, thick pillars,  
ornate decoration and colorful and opulent palaces.  
Monument of Excellence: A fine hostel in Jækánta that welcomes foreigners.  
Morass of the Péne Kánth: A throttle-plant that is semi-intelligent and able to bait  
people with jewels and illusions. It is a yellowish-green phosphorescence with  
branches, leaves, and twisting tendrils. An Éngsvanyáli legion motions from the  
shore and the “stuff” offers jewels and valuables to tempt sailors. If caught, the  
victims are eaten.  
Muállu: This coastal city (S&G Map 3) located near the middle of the Chadára  
Protectorate's coast line is a typical Salarvyáni coastal city/town. The coast  
nearby is studded with enchanted Stelea to repel pirate attacks. The walls are in  
good repair, and town within has narrow streets, elaborately decorated buildings as  
well as the noticeable odor of human bodies, strong pomades, and baking raw sewage.  
There is a frowning fortress where the ruling family (the Hwa'altikonesh) resides,  
over looking the walls, but a long arrow shot within. They were placed in power by  
the Chruggílléshmu to remove the Ruthoshshikh family who ruled the Chadára before it  
was conquered and became a Protectorate. The town is to small (average population  
30,000) to figure into higher politics, and it does not suffer from the attentions  
of the Gürrüshyúgga from Tsa'avúlga. This freedom from outside meddling allows the  
rulers to keep a firm hand on the protectorate. Political dissidents are swiftly  
suppressed, which helps to maintain the town's status as a sleepy backwater. Prices  
are high, outsiders are not encouraged to stay after trading, and there is little  
for sailors or other travelers to do. Most press on to Peléis or Ajján as fast as  
possible. The city's buildings tend to be of a light gray limestone with gray tiled  
roofs made from the local clay. The artisans are not as skilled as in Tsatsayágga  
(or Ajján, for that matter), but they labor hard to cover every available surface  
with carved vines, faces (demons or otherwise), and praises to Shiringgáyi.  
Naggás: The city's walls are well-maintained, with spells and warnings carved into them  
along with magical stelea raised along the shore line. The governor is Lord  
Mmachutusu Hruchchittlantyal, and his palace is high above the city, each side  
carved with a massive, frowning face, which is why it is called “the Palace of the  
Four Faces.” Local legend says that four brother wizards of the Fisherman Kings were  
merged into the tower by the demon Shibb'tlekhkharm, who was cheated of payment for  
his services in creating the port. The streets ascend from the port to the rise of  
the palace, and then descend down to the other side. The rich folk live near the  
rise, and the poor live closer to the walls, and especially by the waterfront. The  
Foreigner's Quarter is small and divided from the rest of the town by the Zurr

river. This city (average population 150,000) is at the far end of Chruggílléshmu  
influence, and although the ruling Hruchchittlantyal family owes their fealty to the  
Chruggílléshmu family through the Vringgamuluk family of Shíggath, they are well  
aware they are at the edge of their sphere, and the Gürrüshyúgga of Tsa'avtúlgu have  
designs upon their city. They have committed their forces to the war with  
Tsa'avtúlgu by way of Shíggath, but the war has been stalemated for years.  
Nchésh of the Trampling Hoard: An Ahoggyá legion of the priestesses of Shiringgáyi at Lake  
Mrissútl and treated almost as pets.  
Nérreshnu: An open work headdress worn by unmarried girls on the 19th of Lésdrim, a  
holiday to honor ancestors in Jækánta. [DoK]  
Nhá-shell Armor: From the shell of the Nhá mollusk. A good armorer grows the mollusk to  
size and shape for the customer. They employ molds, chemicals, and “other” processes  
to “persuade” the Nhá to shape itself to the desired shape and form.  
Nimóllu: Cobbled streets from the harbor rise by a series of stepped terraces to an  
elegant castle-like edifice on the north-eastern summit.  
Nmatl: Species of fish found in Salarvyáni waters.  
Noble children in Salarvyá do not survive long if they do not develop mental defenses like  
blocking telepathy.  
Noble Fashion: Flounced skirts and over cloaks that leave the left arm and shoulder bare;  
the arm is covered by golden armlets that bear clan symbols set with gems. [DoK]  
No woman can rule in Salarvyá by herself.  
Ocher hued sea rushes in eastern Salarvyá.  
Ojjága Flats: This area is famous for its shell fish. The Salarvyáni relish the Shúggwa (a  
black, pulpy thing in a tubular shell) which they eat raw, accompanied by a fiery  
seaweed paste which beginners find vile, and the Ghighánnok (a disk shaped, 12-  
legged, creature in a hard shell) that is baked over coals. One may also mention the  
sea vegetables such as Jujjókhkh(a muddy-green globule of a rubbery consistency), or  
the Ng'atlmóch(a flabby mass with crisp black bulbs throughout), or Hlinnghóm  
(clusters of small pods with a salty taste that is usually fried). The Haqél, “The  
Toother Dweller Below,” is appreciated here as a fine eating fish, although it is  
very expensive due to the dangers of hunting it (when they grow large enough they  
feed on those who hunt them and damage their boats and they are responsible for many  
lost limbs and deaths). The occasional monster sized ones threaten large vessels,  
and expeditions are mounted to hunt them down. A caution to foreigners: although  
these dishes are Salarvyáni delicacies, it takes non-native mouths months to  
acclimatize to them. In addition to tasting vile to the uninitiated, vomiting and  
severe diarrhea are common side-affects. Hlinnghóm is especially vile and only the  
locals eat it.  
River Ojór: Flows by Tsatsayágga.  
Pakhlün: Low antecedents, treachery, dishonesty, etc. = a person from Háida Pakála.  
Peléis: This town (average population 30,000) is thought to have the best cuisine of the  
four cities/towns bordering the Ojjárga Flats. Its has the agricultural bounty of  
rich farm land outside its walls as well as the bounty of the sea from the flats.  
The markets are full of fine black bread, multi-colored fruits, and rich black Drónu  
wine. Foreigners find the land food easier to digest than the seafood, but the  
Lollyánthi (a thick, greasy soup) made from the gelatinous “bones” of a spider is  
guaranteed to cause vomiting in an outlander (which is often quite amusing to the  
locals). The harbor is on the inside of the bay even though the southern suburbs of  
the town overlook the flats. The famous Achetláppen lighthouse and the Káummodh  
lighthouse of Fammánnashtl Isle (about 2 Tsán off the point) allow pilots for hire  
to guide ships around the point without stopping for the night. The city's sturdy  
granite walls and magical stelea to keep pirates away and the occasional warship  
from the Nchésh of the Sea Gray Wave. There is a famous inn in the city, the  
Dhrümmillyithétl House, which has excellent seafood (but very greasy to Tsolyáni  
tastes), and good entertainment as well. If one wishes to discover what the  
Salarvyáni see in a bowl of Lollyánthi soup, or a platter of baked Ghighánnok  
drizzled with Hmélu fat, a side dish of fried Jujjókhkh, and fine, thick black  
Drónu, this is the place to do it. Sailors often throw away their pay here, and so  
many of them have been thrown into the street that the section outside the inn is

locally known as “the pauper's sleeping-mat.” This town has one of the few temples  
dedicated to the Dlamélish Aspect of Shiringgáyi, and it does a brisk business with  
sailors and travelers, though the local Peléisi sneer at the Tsolyáni inability to  
see Her (Shiringgáyi) in Her Oneness. The Peléisi are rather friendly, for  
Salarvyáni, but hard bargainers expecting to earn money from their hospitality;  
however, they are not friendly toward those from Tsa'avtúlgu (the Tsa'avúlguyáni) as  
they both fear and hate them. They will sometimes refer to that place as the “horrid  
city,” avoiding even its mention. The name of the ruling family is Wittupenukh, but  
it is part of the cultural tradition of the city that one never names a person,  
clan, or ruling group that is higher than your own. One says only “wowallyu khukh”  
(loosely translated as “the unmentioned one”). They are a canny family that values  
keeping the city pleasant and profitable. Travelers do not mind the high cost of  
things in the city because of the virtues of the place, and all are grateful that  
Shíggath up the coast of the bay shields them from the attentions of the  
Gürrüshyúgga, and they owe their loyalty to the Chruggílléshmu. The city is a good  
place to collect information (rumors or truth) without moving into non-C  
hruggílléshmu territory. Fammánnashtl Isle off Point Pu'ortlinggoch is sparsely  
populated (only the pilot's station at the lighthouse and a village) but contains  
large Hmélu herds, and Gǘdru plants are cultivated for cloth. Lichens on the isle  
are raised for dyes of ocher and rust, but demand outstrips supply. The villagers  
are thought to be simple and suspicious of visitors, but they spend money freely  
enough when they visit the city.  
Pendéssa: Small fortified town at a river crossing about 150 Tsán from Fort Órmichash  
toward Chichúvu. Taken by the Arikkái forces.  
People of Jækánta are known as Jækántánnü.  
Point Hricháku outside of the town of Hngú SW of Tsatsayágga.  
Poisonous jellyfish are found in the sea off eastern Salarvyá.  
Prince's Legion of the Black Standard.  
Purná: Mollusk that grow to be several feet across. The shell is translucent and used  
as lamp holders in eastern Salarvyá.  
Qímmu: Salarvyáni unit of 1,000 soldiers.  
Retsúllu: A city. They have heavy siege engines mounted atop the towers facing the sea.  
Outside the city at the bridge crossing the Ojór river is a barbican. There are  
bronze bound gates that open to allow access to the walled inner harbor. The back  
wall of the citadel consisted of the sheer cliff of the sugarloaf peak itself. The  
other walls are tremendously thick and massive. Machicolation along the upper  
parapets, and an octagonal tower that commands the narrow pathway leading up to the  
temple. Gates, porticulises and passageways commanded by arrow slits (murder holes)  
guard the way to a pleasant rotunda with windows that overlook the city, the sea,  
and the river Ojór.  
Salarvyáni are sallow and hairy. They are self conscious about being hairy as no other  
known people on Tékumel are.  
Salarvyáni are trusted as far as one can throw them as misdirection and general humorous  
malice are common reactions to foreigners. One must check names 2-3 times, from  
several informants, and one should not be afraid to lie, cheat, and bluster in order  
to get what you want!  
Salarvyáni Military Formation Names: Beetling Cliffs of Distant Paránta  
Mighty Embrace of Ssirandár  
Reveries of Distant Empire  
Viridian Serpent  
Seen from afar above the steaming, sweltering gray-green plain, the mansions of Salarvyá  
are gaudy mountains teaming with sculpted figures, ant-hills of color and chaotic  
movement, topped with gilded domes, bulbous cupolas, and sky-reaching gables all  
a-crawl with gargoyles and other mythic beasts – more than a man could assimilate if  
he stood rooted to the earth and gazed for thrice 3 thousand years!” description by  
the Tsolyáni traveler Diján hiBasküné (who died in 2117 A.S.).  
Shíggath: This town (average population of 30,000) is a strong contrast to other towns on  
the Ojjárga Flats. It is situated by the mouth of the Tsa'av river, which is  
navigable up stream to Tsa'avtúlgu by riverine vessels, and the transshipment of

goods from sea going vessels takes place here. The river spills an unpleasant  
yellow-colored mud into the bay and flats, and the waters near the town are stained  
with it. The ruler, Lord Chuggillishmayul Vringgamuluk, is a fussy little man  
devoted to his creature comforts and the deference of his subjects. He is obsequious  
to those he is inferior to (notably powerful Chruggílléshmu and Gürrüshyúgga  
agents), and over bearing and demanding of those below him (he has been described as  
“like a slimy hair-ball found under a rug”). The Vringgamuluk family is the dominate  
political force of the Flats, and they have been fighting a “war” with the forces of  
Tsa'avtúlgu for years. The Tsa'avtúlgu armies are better equipped but indifferently  
lead as well as being poor fighters. The Shíggath forces are small and also poorly  
lead, but they are supplemented by troops sent from Naggás as well as hired Háida  
Pakála mercenaries. The Vringgamuluk citadel of black granite frowns over the town,  
and the black-hatted police force is known to be more concerned with extracting  
money than with enforcing the law, save for periodic sweeps for “known criminals.”  
It is rumored that travelers disappear here, and most visitors prefer to sleep on  
their ships or outside of town in tents (the city has its share of Gürrüshyúgga  
spies, and those travelers who interest the Lords of Tsa'avtúlgu may find themselves  
drugged and carried off). Although the town can hardly be considered a happy place,  
the citizens do bustle, and they seem to be fairly prosperous. There is a large  
amount of merchant traffic with buying and selling especially of luxury goods, and  
the taxes that are paid from this traffic flood into the town's coffers. The  
Vringgamuluk also collect tribute from the other families under it, as they do from  
those under them, and they “tax” all their “police” can strong arm outside the city  
either on land or water.  
Shringgáyi's 36 motherly teats. She has a “Garden of Eternal Verdure”.  
Special naming sages are popular in western Salarvyá while in the east they pick a name.  
Starting on the S&G map #3 the ethnicity of the population begins to change until one gets  
to the eastern coast where the people are referred to as Salarvyáni but ethnically  
they aren't.  
The Láchish Lords of Fort Órmichash and Fort Vrusággu came to the area “only” a few  
thousand years ago.  
The Old Fighters: This organization is constantly agitating to regain Fénul from the  
Tsolyáni. They are also working for Salarvyáni “linguistic purity” (no Tsolyáni  
words or phrases), trade only with Salarvyá (not northward to Hekéllu), pure  
Salarvyáni religion (no Dlamélish/Avánthe split), etc. They are lead by a “Princess”  
of Khúm, Zéshsha Tiqinnu Thirreqúmmu, who has not been to Fénul at all!  
Villages in eastern Salarvyá have dances where the men face the women in lines and they  
perform elaborate steps.  
Vlíkka: worms that eat wood. They are more common in the east than the west.  
Wasteland of Sorrow: A place that is barren, icy, cold, and those interned there endure  
eternal torment.  
With the death (murder) of the Mad King by worshipers of Black Qárqa from Tsa'avtúlgu,  
then the death of the council of nobles, the Khomórg (Shiringgáyi fanatics) rose up  
and order broke down. Cities rethought their allegiance to the Ebon Throne and the  
Tsolyáni forces invaded to take revenge for the Salarvyáni invasion during their  
Civil War. The Ahoggyá of the Sharúna Lowlands rose up, sallied out and killed every  
human they could lay their hands on. They probably ate their share also.  
Zachá fish have red meat.

Service of the Investiture of Indigo: Ceremony.  
This priesthood is one of the most secretive and complex organizations in the empire. Its  
real goals are hidden behind many layers of false or half-true statements. The Ndálu  
Clan is one of the most secretive societies within the temple, and the Blue Light  
Society is another; however, unlike the Ndálu Clan, the Blue Light does not wish to  
take part in the politics of the empire. Butrús is an ancient stronghold of the  
temple. The temple has a shrine in the (not so) ruined city of Hmákuyál: House of  
the Cerulean Clarity in the College of Mirrored Radiance. In that city also resides  
the Phantasmic Library of the Indigo Tower. There is also the subterranean shrine of  
the Azure Orb beneath the necropolis outside of Jakálla.  
The temple in Pála Jakálla has recently expanded its fiefs and holdings of townhouses  
thanks to the generosity of Kurshétl hiSsánmirin. It has 48 known members, has a

and over 50 eyes are held. The Society of Blue Light currently holds sway in the  
temple and has 28 known members including the chief priest. The Ndálu Clan has 28  
member in and out of the temple. The temple has recently come into dispute with the  
temple of Thúmis over the discovery of one of their sponsored expeditions of an

The Stalkers of the Indigo Night is a secret organization dedicated to protecting Ksárul  
and Hrü'ǘ pilgrims on the road to the shrines of the (not so) Ruined City of  
Hmákuyál. Members come from the Temple Guards of the Temples of Ksárul, Grugánu, and  
Hrü'ǘ, and given the sinister nature of these “cults,” they are very likely to have  
other functions as well as policing the Sákbe road past it and provincial highways  
leading to it.  
The Tumíssan Temple has 60 guards and 120 or so clergy with a capacity for twice that.  
The Yi'ita (about 100 Tsán north of Tumíssa with a population of about 5,000) Temple of  
Ksárul serves about 100 people mainly from the Black Stone, Weeping Stone, and Black  
Hand clans.  
To a Ksárulite knowledge possessed by those who do not follow Ksárul is not knowledge but  
ignorance. Theft under these conditions is not ignoble because those who had it were  
not noble – and unable to retaliate.  
The basic precept of the temple is that things can never be as they were. The cosmos is  
Change, and the only permanence in the universe is Change itself.  
Qón

Béy Sǘ: On the right bank of Mssúma river there is the vast temple complex of Avánthe, the  
temple of Keténgku, the mighty complex of Sárku's temple of the Rising from the  
Tomb, a few other minor temples, the City of the Dead where all the Tlakotáni  
emperors are laid to rest as well as the graves of many from the Bednálljan dynasty,  
and lastly the Tólek Kána Pits which is the vast imperial prison complex. Most of  
the temples, the City of the Dead and the Pits are connected via the “underworld”.

are Salarvyáni decent. There are no palaces in the village and there are small  
temples (really shrines) to Dlamélish, Avánthe, Shiringgáyi, and Belkhánu. The head  
man is Dik hiZhigau (Green Kirtle clan). There is no formal garrison but a cohort of  
militia can be raised as needed in a few hours. The third rate Sákbe road on the  
dike which runs along the river protecting the area from the rainy season floods has  
about 10 guards from the local militia at any one time.

Chaigári Protectorate:

1. Geography= Two main terrain features dominate the Chaigári protectorate, Kákri Midállu  
    peak and its surrounding ranges, and the Kanayugára River. Kákri Midállu is the  
    youngest of the three major mountain ranges in the vicinity, the others being Tláni  
    Hidállu peak and the oldest being the Chayéngar range. All of these ranges have been  
    caused by the collision of the Salarvyáni continent with that containing Tsolyánu  
    Even though Tékumel lacks the uranium in its core which keeps the Earth's core  
    fluid, its larger size led to a greater release of gravitational energy when it  
    collapsed to provide a much larger fluid core with a longer cooling time. That plus  
    the larger energy it received from its sun (until recently by geological time) have  
    combined to give Tékumel a fluid core and a plastic mantle. This leads to volcanoes,  
    earthquakes, and continental drift. Since continents are more common than oceans on  
    Tékumel, continent-continent collisions are more common than continent-ocean  
    collisions. Continent-continent collisions are spectacular. The Himalayas of  
    northern India are the product of a continent-continent collision and are the  
    highest mountains on Earth. Lake Baikal in the Soviet Union sits in a hole caused by  
    a fault resulting from that collision, even though it is over 1500km away from the  
    point of impact. In this case, the Tsolyáni-Salarvyáni continent moving north  
    collided with the eastward moving Yán Koryáni-Jannuyáni continent. In the Chaigári  
    region the initial impact created a series of east-west trending over thrusts which  
    flung up the Chayéngar range and another series of ranges south of it. The  
    Kanayugára river runs in a gap between these ranges. After the initial collision,  
    the Salarvyáni portion of the continent rotated first one way, flinging up a series  
    of northeast-southwest trending over thrusts on top of the east-west ones, and then  
    the other throwing up more over thrusts in the northwest-southeast direction. Where  
    these secondary over thrusts overlapped the original east-west over thrusts,  
    mountains were piled on top of mountains. The results are the spectacular Tláni  
    Hidállu and Kákri Midállu peaks. In the course of all of this, the 10km thick  
    continental crust of Salarvyá was shortened by a hundred kilometers. All of that  
    rock went up.  
    The other major geographic influence on the Chaigári is the Kanayugára river.  
    For the best part of 50 million years there has been a Kanayugára river winding back  
    and forth across its valley, working and reworking it. The valley is broad, flat,  
    and steep-walled with a thick soil layer regularly recharged with fresh loam eroded  
    from the mountains and brought down by fast flowing streams.
2. Geology= The mountains immediately north and south of the Kanayugára river are the  
    oldest and hence the most eroded in the region. In some cases only the metamorphosed  
    core of the original mountain remains, yielding marble, slate, and a few heat  
    produced gem stones. In other places, whole cliff faces of sandstone and limestone  
    present themselves for easy quarrying for building materials. A type of coal  
    can also be found, but it is purplish in color and extremely malodorous. Any who  
    can afford to use charcoal do so. Seeps of oil are also found here and there in the  
    Chaigári, but this is particularly nasty stuff, evil smelling and extremely  
    corrosive. Areas around such pools are devoid of normal life, although Food of the  
    Ssǘ can be found growing there, and any who fall into such a pool could well find it  
    the most unpleasant experience of their rapidly diminishing lives.
3. Agriculture= The broad, rich valley of the Kanayugára is somewhat cooler than the dusty  
    plains of the Imperium and although Dná grain is cultivated, hardier grains such as  
    wheat are more common here. As well, many specialty fruits and vegetables not  
    commonly available in the Imperium are available here, but the reverse is also  
    true. High quality Ngalu fruit does not flourish here and therefore the Chaigári  
    produces little decent wine with the possible exception of Fénul Some of its berry  
    concoctions are drinkable and mildly amusing to the connoisseur. Those who can  
    afford to, import wine. Hekéllu is somewhat well-known, however for the quality of  
    both its wheat and barley beers.  
    Chaigári is chiefly known for its animal husbandry and land too poor to grow  
    crops is used to graze the huge herds of Chlén, Hmá, and Hmélu (Chlén at the lowest  
    and Hmélu at the highest elevation). Final fattening of animals is often done at the  
    lower elevations in recently harvested fields or fields allowed to lie fallow. This

```
also helps enrich the fields.
```

4. Ethnicity= The protectorate was conquered from the Salarvyáni a little over three  
    hundred years ago and many of its citizens claim Salarvyáni descent. Most of these  
    live in and around the town of Fénul. Since the conquest there has been a steady  
    stream of political refugees and more recently refugees from Ssǘ activities. Also  
    some wealthier Salarvyáni choose to reside in Fénul owing to the lower and more  
    consistent Tsolyáni tax structure.  
    Hekéllu contains few Salarvyáni, by contrast. Hekéllu was rather badly damaged  
    during the conquest and since it was already long overdue for Ditlána, the town was  
    leveled and built anew. Many of the Salarvyáni left at this time and were replaced  
    by Tsolyáni. Tsolyáni had been colonizing the area for some time prior to the  
    conquest in any case. Today only the lake fishing clans and some of the merchant  
    clans claim direct Salarvyáni descent, and even these people appear to be Tsolyáni  
    due to intermarriage.  
    Tsolyáni form most of the population of Hekéllu with the exceptions noted  
    above and except for some native menials of Kilalámmu stock. Tsolyáni also dominate,  
    if not form the majority of the population of the area around Hekéllu and the  
    Kanayugára river as far east as the big bend. These areas have been heavily  
    colonized by the agricultural clans from Ferinára and Sokátis. Of the Tsolyáni in  
    Hekéllu, most are from eastern based clans of scribes and officials and also  
    merchant and transportation clans. Tsolyáni in Chaigári average 1-2 cm taller than  
    their cousins in the Imperium owing to a diet higher in protein.  
    Most of the mountainous areas and portions of the river valley are populated  
    by indigenous Chaigári tribesmen. These people owe a great deal ethnically to the  
    Kilalámmuyáni and Jannuyáni stock. Short and of wiry build, they are poor  
    agriculturalists, being at best subsistence level farmers. They are far better  
    herdsmen, hunters and mountaineers. Lately they have been used as miners and  
    quarrymen. Although their small stature suits them to mining, their light builds do  
    not. There are better miners to be found elsewhere in the Imperium and some of these  
    have begun moving into the area.  
    Their language has been identified as a dialect of Jannuyáni, but has  
    borrowed a great deal from Tsolyáni and Salarvyáni. Because they tend to be quite  
    insular, large variations in dialect can be found from mountain valley to mountain  
    valley. In the north and west the Tsolyáni influences dominate and in the south the  
    Salarvyáni becomes transcendent. Banditry is endemic among the tribesmen and while  
    some of this may be attributed to the Kilalámmuyáni, the locals make up the bulk of  
    the bandits. Tsolyáni proverb, "A Chaigári herdsman is a bandit who has stolen many  
    animals."
5. Economy= The protectorate has several major industries and it depends on the time of  
    year which is the largest income earner. Mining and quarrying are the largest  
    industries in most years, however. In various places may be found tin, lead, zinc,  
    silver, and gold. While almost no iron production exists in Chaigári, iron is found  
    in western Kilalámmu and southeastern Milumanayá, and a lot of ore finds its way to  
    Hekéllu. Most ores are concentrated in Hekéllu for trans-shipment to the larger  
    population centers but there is a small domestic iron/steel industry which supplies  
    Hekéllu armorers.  
    Many gems and semi-precious stones are also brought out of the mountains.  
    Jadeite, lapis lazuli, agate, carnelian, tiger eye, amethyst, and quartz are found  
    in abundance. Opals, rubies, emeralds, garnets, diamonds, and sapphires are also  
    found. An ornamental quartz called a Chaigár is peculiar to the foothills of Kákri  
    Midállu peak and is found nowhere else in the known world. The rich translucent  
    brown variety and the dark blue variety with pale veining are the most valuable. The  
    pale blue, yellow, and purple varieties are too close in appearance to other types  
    of ornamental quartz found elsewhere to be as valuable.  
    Chaigári and surrounding area produce abundant building quality stone.  
    Limestone, sandstone, and slate are so common that kiln-dried brick is rare in  
    Hekéllu and sun-dried brick is only found as a temporary building material or in  
    some of the pooerer river side villages. Even many of the poor live in sandstone  
    buildings with slate roofs. The buildings of the rich, the temples, and the major

public buildings are commonly faced with fine limestone and rich marbles. Gneiss and  
schist are also found and inlays of agate, quartz, and lapis lazuli are also seen.  
Basalt and granite are not to be found as the nearest sources are in the Hundránu  
Rise outside of Sokátis. Hekéllu therefore presents a pleasing facade of red, pink,  
white, cream, gray, blue, and even black buildings with gray slate roofs. Ample  
supplies of sand, gravel, and limestone have also led to a thriving cement and  
concrete industry. Much of the stone for export is at least rough dressed in Hekéllu  
or Fénul and thus the masonry clans are quite powerful in both towns.  
The next leading export is meat. Huge herds of Hmélu and Hmá roam the rough  
ground and foothills of Chaigári. Hekéllu and Fénul both have packing industries,  
Hekéllu for shipping to the Imperium and Fénul to Salarvyá. Animals for export are  
slaughtered in the late fall to early spring in order that they may be shipped in  
cooler weather. They are usually lightly salted or smoked for preservation, but not  
heavily so as salt or wood for smoking both have to be imported. In addition, the  
higher reaches of the mountains contain game animals, such as Tsi'íl, which are  
hunted for their meat. Most such game is exported to places like Fasiltúm where it  
is served at the feasts of the wealthy. It is considerably cheaper in Hekéllu and it  
is a rare middle-class feast there where it is not included.  
Chaigári is also known for the quality of its Chlén beasts. Most of these are  
peeled in situ but poorer armor producers are shipped out loaded as beasts of  
burden and sold at their destinations along with their cargoes. Some of the hides  
are merely treated to preserve them and shipped while others are turned into  
finished products in Hekéllu and Fénul. There are thus several thriving armorer's  
clans in both towns and those in Hekéllu also make some steel armor on occasion  
with iron ore from Kilalámmu.  
Farming is mostly for domestic consumption and in fact Dná grain often has to  
be brought in from Ferinára to meet needs, due to the shorter growing season and the  
shortage of arable land. Wheat and other rare hardy grains are more common and many  
of these are exported for specialty baking. The higher unit value of these grains  
usually means a net profit for Chaigári in most years.  
Fishing is also worthy of note. Lake Hekéllu produces several species of  
edible fish, mostly for domestic consumption. The mountain streams also produce some  
excellent eating fish, although not in significant quantity. There are also several  
species of shellfish to be found in the lake and streams and these are considered  
gourmet delicacies. They are caught and rushed live in tanks of water to Sokátis and  
Fasiltúm to grace the tables of the truly wealthy. Additionally, there is a species  
of bottom dwelling fish in the lake which can be jigged for. While the fish itself  
is virtually inedible, in the fall the female produces a roe which commands a fancy  
price indeed at the tables of the very wealthy (up to 50K per kg in Fasiltúm, more  
elsewhere). The fish can get up to 6 meters in length and a single female can  
produce up to 10kg of roe. However, a single fisherman is lucky indeed if he gets  
more than a bite or two in a season. They fight hard once hooked, struggling for  
hours or even days, and frequently escape or sink the boat and eat the fisherman.  
Even when a catch has been boated it is a male as often as not. There is even a  
small chance that a female has already laid her eggs.  
Although there are occasional woods and forested areas in the mountains, all  
hardwoods must be imported. The softwood forests of the Chaigári do produce some  
tall straight spars which are rafted down the river to Jakálla to make masts. These  
are superior to the usual hardwood masts because they do not require splicing to  
make a full mast and their lighter weight leaves the vessel lighter and less top  
heavy.  
Another revenue earner is trade, between Tsolyánu and Salarvyá in Fénul and  
Hekéllu and between Tsolyánu and the states of the northeast in Hekéllu. Hekéllu is  
the effective head of navigation of the river for large barges and hence serves as  
headquarters for large numbers of carters, bargemen's, and mercantile clans. One  
clan is able through a clan secret to produce ice, even in summer. It is they who  
ship roe and other valuable perishables by refrigerating them. The price is very  
high, however, and the process is dangerous and leads to periodic damage by fire or  
explosion to the clan house.

Company of the Crystal Sword: A group started out as a band of hardy adventurers of  
medium clan who found a benefactor in Lord Hetepk hiAztlan. In the course of many  
adventures, the wealth of Hetepk grew, and the band became the Company. Hetepk  
became aware of a legend of great antiquity concerning a King of the Dragon Warriors  
and his six sons. To each son he gave a powerful sword, each having the essence of  
one of the elements. The search for these weapons was long, and the Clan of the  
Silver Links was grateful and took the band into it which worked to the benefit of  
both. [BRA]  
Court of Crys: City of Púrdimal below the Temple of Ksárul and outside of the Temple

Fasiltúm has mines.  
Fénul: Two roads lead from Fénul northward. A minor one skirts the Kákri Midallu Peak  
highlands and the Ssǘ enclave, and a major provincial highway skirts the Salarvyáni  
border then follows the provincial border through the highlands between Tláni  
Hidallu Peak and Kákri Midallu Peak to Hekéllu. Most of the mines in the highlands  
of the area north of Fénul are owned by the Imperium, but there are clan as well as  
personal ownership of some. The mines employ free men, but the heavy labor is done  
by slaves. These are purchased in Tsolyánu, loaded with supplies and marched to  
Hekéllu and/or Fénul and thence to the mines. They are then worked until they die  
but not in the way the Nazis or Soviets did. Discipline is not a problem as those  
who are a problem are placed outside the compound at night and nature takes its  
course. There are gold, silver, copper, tin, and a very few small iron mines in the  
area.

Population averages are: Pála- 30,000, Jakálla- 600,000, Músa- 7,500. The Gate of  
Bones (that gate which leads to the City of the Dead) is officially named the “High  
Gate of Chaimaktel” who was a mistress of Ssirandár I, but the gate was really built  
during the last Ditlána.

Kachor chiefs of the Inner Range of the Chákas.  
Kashkomái: A little valley in the mountains to the east of Sokátis where the “Worm Prince”  
retired after his mind was befuddled. There are iron mines there.  
Katalál: Most people worship the war gods but Vimúhla and Chiténg are worshiped the most,  
and other Stability Gods are not popular. Its walls are red-and-black chequered and  
there is a tiny blue lake that is fed by artisan wells. The streets are lined with  
Gápul trees, and it is known for its roof gardens giving it the look of an overgrown  
mound. The white governor's palace is above the lake, and the temples of Karakán and  
Vimúhla face each other across the square. Traditional garb is kilts with red-and-  
black checks and stripes, short cloaks of thésun gauze, and flat, wide-brimmed hats  
of enameled Chlén-hide. The unpretentious Temple of Thúmis is on a side street of  
the main square.  
Khirgár has walls and towers that are bluff brown in color. Hot in the summer, windy in  
the spring and autumn, blustery and sometimes chill in the winter. Upon its steep  
hill, the old town hoards its memories to itself. The lowest concentric ring of  
walls is of red sandstone and black basalt, and the gates bare the sigil of Emperor  
Metlunel II “the Builder.” Within these ramparts, the second ring skirts the lower  
slopes of the hill; this is made of Éngsvanyáli gray granite brought from the  
mountains to the east. The third and highest battlements, those surrounding the  
edifices of the dim age of the Bednálljans, the First Imperium, are of marble and  
black diorite, stone not found in the area. Bands of sand-scoured glyphs march  
around these innermost and highest towers proclaiming the majesty of Queen Nayári of  
the Silken Thighs. Other slender spires speak of the Priestkings of Éngsvan hla  
Gánga, the Golden Age of Pavár. The truncated pyramids and monumental walls of the  
present Second Imperium jostle for room amongst these older, more graceful  
structures. Upper Town is quieter, the narrow, wind-worn, many storeyed clanhouses  
leaning against one another like old ladies exhausted from a day's excursion. There  
is a steep climb to the Gates of the Blue Fish, named for some hoary, local deity.  
High God Hill, beyond the Blue Fish Gate, had once been arranged in a neat square  
around a central plaza: armory and legion barracks to the left of the gatehouse at  
the southeast corner; the colonnades of the administrative offices opposite in the  
southwest; the temples crowded together along the crest of the hill in the north-  
west; and the Citadel of Victories of the Emperor on the summit to the northeast,  
facing the windy deserts beyond which lay Milumanayá and Yán Kór. The citadel dates  
from the First Imperium, but has been rebuilt and refurbished many times. The  
pattern of High God Hill was spoiled by buildings thrown up helter-skelter during  
the past 1,000 years so that the plaza exists only as an irregular patch of rutted  
stone around the stump of an Éngsvanyáli obelisk while the clanhouses of the  
newly rich jostle with each other for a place in its shadow. The army built more  
barracks here, the temples an annex there, the Imperium another hall for scribes and  
records in that corner. The citadel has bronze banded gates. The city is usually  
crowed but the war made things worse.

Puru oil: beloved by those in Béy Sǘ, and used for body treatments.  
Rǘ: Just north of the Hundránu Rise lies the little valley of Kaskkomai where there is  
much agriculture. Near Rǘ the terrain is hilly, with fields and copses interspersed  
with stands of larger trees. As one travels north toward the Rise, the hills become  
higher and less easy to traverse, until one reaches the top of the low pass between  
the Rise and the Gilráya Forest. The forest is quite dense with many critters. The  
trees are deciduous (Gapúl, Dáichu, etc.), with occasional small, hardy peasant  
holdings. South of Rǘ the Sákbe road runs to neighboring Mmilláka, a Salarvyáni city  
par excellence. The countryside is filled with villages, small towns, farms, and  
grazing for herds of meat animals. The great city of Koylugá consumes most of the  
produce from this area while some goes to Khúm also. Around Tláni Hidállu peak there  
are some sheer precipices and dizzy climbs with Ssǘ rumored to be around. The higher  
one goes the vegetation tends towards dense stands of black-needled Tíu trees.  
Higher up, the summits of the peaks in the area are bare or only sparsely covered  
with high mountain scrub. The lower slopes of neighboring Kákri Mídallu peak are  
inhabited by hardy, suspicious, courageous farmers – the region is invaded, raided,  
and terrorized by groups of Ssǘ, who have become bolder in recent years. The peaks  
of the Chayéngar Range are higher and wilder yet.  
This city is an anomaly: a Tsolyáni town right on the edge of the border of  
Salarvyá, with which it trades constantly. It is under considerable Salarvyáni  
influence but still retains its essential character. It was founded during the rein  
of Kánmi'yel Nikúma I (1031-1067 A.S.). Later, at the time of the Siege of Mmilláka,  
Emperor Hejjéka II “the Heretic” (1325-1340 A.S.), populated it with colonists from  
the east-central provinces of the empire. He expected it would be the first to carry  
the banners of Tsolyánu into the Salarvyáni homeland. This did not work: the  
“invasion” ended in a standoff, with the Tsolyáni facing a sea of hostile Salarvyáni  
around them. The Salarvyáni tolerated Rǘ because it was a useful trading depot, but  
they allow few Tsolyáni into their own areas. The teaching of the Tsolyáni language  
as well as the Tsolyáni temples is forbidden, especially the Éngsvanyáli doctrine  
that the two goddesses Avánthe and Dlamélish are separate beings: the Salarvyáni  
consider them to be Aspects of one Goddess Shiringgáyi.  
Emperor Gyésmu, the Iron Fist (2015-2065 A.S.) restored the town and started to  
construct fortifications and public buildings, but these were left unfinished when  
he died. Up until the ascension of Emperor Dhich'uné, it was a backwater town, with  
large a population of Salarvyáni and Tsolyáni merchants and culture. Shortly after  
that ascension, the Salarvyáni struck out from Koylugá and Khúm to take it back.  
They took the town, but eventually had to give it up. They were going to burn it to  
the ground, but the Tsolyáni governor persuaded them not to (the merchants clans of  
the town also have alliances with Salarvyáni merchant clans and they put pressure on  
also).  
The town is roughly an oval, with various small lakes and ponds on the south, in  
the midst of lush fields and groves of trees. The Gilráya Forest begins to the west,  
and parties of noble hunters often come to try their luck with Sérudla and other  
beasts there. About 80-90 Tsán to the south lies the ancient city of Mmilláka,  
besieged by Emperor Hejjéka II during 1300 A.S. It is much more of a typical  
Salarvyáni city with bulbous domes, thick pillars, ornate decoration and colorful  
and opulent palaces.

political or social doctrine, as long as it has the sanction of their faith and  
tradition. Those who obey their teachings openly and proudly are “noble”; those who  
are lazy, hypocritical, weak, or unwilling to act are “ignoble” and beneath  
contempt. Warfare is thus noble to followers of Lord Karakán when it is fought for  
the prosperity and stability of the state. He also ordains the sacrifice of captured  
enemy warriors upon his altars. This is “noble” for the War-god's devotees. Those

help people from the upper-level mercantile clans, while members of “Dark Trinity”

honorable man, however, and has only been known to sell a few of his Tsolyáni  
visitors into slavery in Háida Pakála or into something worse in Tsa'avtúlgu – and  
only because they annoyed him or were arrogant or perhaps worshiped Durritlámish,  
whom he particularly loathes. They say his breath stinks bad enough to slay a Chlén-  
beast! Also, they say his womenfolk have to eat a Salarvyáni herb that completely  
kills their sense of smell, and his bodily cleanliness is just as bad so stand

Infantry. Currently the legion is being reconstituted after its experiences during  
the civil war [MitV1]. Originally a nomad from the Dry Bay of Ssu'úm, he was hired  
as a mercenary by one of the less affluent member of the Clan of Sea Blue. In that  
employment he gained enough wealth to purchase a position as a legionnaire in the  
Legion of Sérqu, Sword of the Empire (14th Imperial Heavy Infantry). His dedication  
and fighting prowess brought him to the attention of the Commanding General and he  
was slowly promoted until he became a Molkár. The untimely death of the commander of  
the Legion of Mnáshu of Thri'íl opened the way for his promotion to that post. To do  
this Sérqu took Korúnme into his clan and lineage, the prestigious Chaishyáni. The  
promotion was signed off on by Prince Eselné. 31yrs old in 2354 AS. [MARB]

and immediate family are of the “poor relation” variety. Before his inclusion in the  
delegation he served as a Lector Priest in the Subterranean Shrine of the Azure Orb  
beneath the necropolis outside Jakálla, and he witnessed the terrible guardians who  
guard the sepulchers of the pontiffs of the temple. He is thin, gaunt already  
graying at the temples, bulging forehead, and widows peak. Lantern jaw, sunken  
cheeks, and dark circles around the eyes with a long, thin nose giving him the look  
of a Qásu bird eyeing a dead fish. Not really ugly but looks older than his 20's.
