## Life Events:
 BirthsAll births are registered with the Palace of the Realm, and birth festivities are
as lavish as the family budget will allow (10 káitars for a peasant up to 10,000 káitars
for the nobility).
Males are heavily celebrated in the south while females are in the north.
Naming is very important in the Five Empires and in Mihállu.
Puberty is another occasion for feasting, rituals, and rites of passage. At this
time, adolescents are usually inducted into the clans of the Five Empires, their client
states, and Mihállu.
## Health:
 DiseaseMottled and Spotted plagues- 60% chance of Tsúral buds being effective against.
Occurs mostly in hot & humid areas and is spread by touch and/or breath.
Plague of the White Hand- 15% chance of natural immunity. There is no known cure,
and if contracted, death comes in 2-3 days.
Rotting Death- 70% chance of a cure with Hmíss weed bark concoction if drank 2-3
times a day until it is totally healed.
Black Flux- Painful diarrhea and vomiting but usually not fatal.
Ailment of Arkun Mssa- No known cure.
STD- Carried by females but has no effect on their genitalia. This causes the penis
to swell like Elephantiasis. No known natural cure but the poison buildup can be drained
by laying the penis on a hard surface and hitting it with a mallet (very painful!!!) and
letting it drain for a couple of hours. The man will survive if the poison is drained but
the woman will eventually die.

A person of the lower social orders addresses an equal as “tsám”, and if they are
plural as “tlúmi”. He calls his superiors “túsmi” or “túsmidal” or “mìsritúsmidàli”
according to their status. A man of the middle class speaks to inferiors as “tsám” or
“tlúmi”, to equals as “túsmi” and “tlúmiyel”, and to those of higher status as
“túsmidàli” or “mìsritúsmidàli” as they require. Persons of the upper and noble classes
follow similar patterns. Men and women both use the same status-pronouns for the same
types of addressees: a lady of the middle status calls her social equals of either gender
“túsmi” and “tlúmiyel” just as her husband does.
In the privacy of the bedchamber even a high noble addresses his wife as “tsám”,
and she may respond in kind. Amongst intimate family members and retainers he may call
her “túsmi”, instead of “mìsritúsmidáli”, and she may reply with “tsúmi” or “túsmidàli”
in return. Close friends of both sexes often address one another as “tsám” or “túsmi”
irrespective of rank. The beginner must be cautious in applying this principle, and it is
proper to ask whether the other person minds being treated as a familiar or not. Note
also that while this practice may be applied to equals and inferiors, one can not use it
with superiors.
