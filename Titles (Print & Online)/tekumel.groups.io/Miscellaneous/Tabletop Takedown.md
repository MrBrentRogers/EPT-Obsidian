# Introduction

Welcome to Tabletop Takedown, the easy and inexpensive game of miniature combat. This game came about as a direct response to the proliferation of high-priced and overly complex miniature games. With this sheet and less than five dollars worth of equipment you can stage endless battles. Enjoy! **PS – wear eye protection!**

# Playing Pieces

You will need the following items commonly available at dollar stores, toy and hobby shops, etc. At least 20 small plastic soldier figures (preferably in two different colors), a box of small rubber bands (these are the guns your warriors will use), a sheet of scrap paper for each player (this will be used to create ammunition for your troops), some books (these will be the hills and buildings your war is fought around), one piece of three inch string and one piece of six inch string for each player. You will also need a number of pennies, buttons or other small objects equal to the number of soldiers.

# Setup

Flip a coin. The person who calls it sets up the terrain upon which you will be playing, and then sets up their figures on their edge of the playing surface. Place one rubber band and ten paper wads with each figure (if a band breaks, your soldier has a defective gun). The loser gets to set up their figures on their edge of the playing surface and also gets to move first. Determine a time limit for the your game, from thirty minutes to hours. If you are playing a series of battles, you may set a point total to play to (see Winning below).

# Movement

Figures may be moved up to six inches each turn (“prone” figures may move only three inches, “mounted” figures may move up to twelve inches). After moving a figure place a penny next to it to indicate that it is finished for the turn. Figures may alternatively be moved up to three inches and may then fire at an opposing force (“prone” figures may move only one inch and then fire, “mounted” figures may move up to six inches and then fire). When all of your figures have been moved or have fought, remove the markers. Your opponent then removes any of their dead soldiers and gives the figures to you for later tallying. It is now the other player’s turn.

# Combat

If you choose to have one of your figures fire at an enemy unit, you must take a rubber band, a small (one inch square) wad of paper and, holding the rubber band as close to the front of your figure as possible, with your fingertips on the playing surface, aim and fire at the enemy unit. If the unit is knocked over it is dead. If the hit figure knocks over any other figures place a marker next to them, they are stunned and do not move or fire during the opponent’s next turn. Each soldier may only fire once per turn. If you run out of paper wads your forces are out of ammo and should begin a strategic withdrawal.

If any soldiers end their movement within one inch of an enemy unit they are considered to be in hand to hand combat. Each player flips a coin for his or her soldier, starting with the player of the attacked figure and alternating. Heads = alive, Tails = dead. If both come up heads, players flip again until at least one soldier is dead.

# Winning

After the battle is ended you are scored according to the following chart.

1 point for each of your surviving infantry units. 2 points for each dead enemy infantry unit.

2 points for each of your surviving cavalry units. 4 points for each dead enemy cavalry unit.

# Game Suggestions

**Capture the Flag**: each player puts an object on their edge of the board. The first player to get three figures within one inch of their opponent’s object wins.

**Rush the Line**: the first player to get all of their surviving soldiers to the opposite side of the board wins.
