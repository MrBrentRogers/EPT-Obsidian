Tékumel Source Book
```
Regulus set up secret observation outposts in remote areas of Tékumel (or perhaps they had been there all along since before the planet was terraformed?). The aquatic Nyaggá from Alhena and the translucent crystalloid Hokún from Markeb did the same. The strange and unpredictable Mihálli from Dorsum, a race endowed with interdimensional travel and objectives so unintelligible that commerce with them was forbidden, appeared without warning and proceeded to dig an underground city in the wilds of the northern hemisphere. Since they bothered no one and since they were of mild interest to the jaded masters of Tékumel, they were left unopposed.

In their ancient fastnesses the Ssú and the Hlüss brooded, waited, and bided their time. Patches of the Old Vegetation learned to adapt and to flourish in the untravelled depths of the remotest hinterlands. 

Thus it remained until the Time of Darkness. No records exist of this catastrophic age. The few fragments of folk memory which do exist lament in mythic terms of a time when the hills rose up, the seas walked the land, flame spouted from the brazen mouths of the mountains, and the stars went out forever. This last is most significant: it must be assumed that Tékumel and its solar system fell -- or were thrust -- through a warp in the fabric of space-time itself, a “hole in the sky,” into a pocket dimension in which no other matter existed. The reasons for this terrible calamity can only be guessed: natural forces, stresses created by the incessant use of the Three-Light Drive, the actions of a hostile race, interference from mighty interdimensional beings far beyond man and his allies on the evolutionary scale, the vengeance of God upon His arrogant and overweening Creation --? No one knows. It may only be noted in passing that this same fate befell 722 other worlds of Humanspace within a century after the disappearance of Tékumel and its system. If these catastrophes are due to some unimaginable weapon, it is a terrible one indeed and one for which no known race has yet developed a counter.

The sudden cutting of the lines of magnetic and gravitational force which link star to star caused unimaginable strain upon the sun and planets of Tékumel system. For a time the survival of life itself hung by the slenderest of threads. Dazed and shocked, the survivors of the cataclysm, man and non-man alike, looked up into the black emptiness of the new night sky and despaired. Communications and commerce were gone. The great ships stood idle because there was nowhere for them to go. Cities sprawled in ruins, new lands rose dripping from the oceans, while others sank beneath the waters. Food production and distribution came to a halt. Plagues once thought banished forever returned to stalk the land. Factories went silent as power sources failed. Raw materials once brought from the stars became unavailable -- particularly iron which had never been common on Tékumel due to the planet’s light core. The machines of former times became great prizes and assumed an air of wonder and of sanctity. As the centers of education were obliterated by earthquake, volcano, and the ravages of time, technicians could not be found to maintain the machines, and one by one the lights went out, bringing about a darkness which was not only of the skies or of the cities but also of the mind....

Some machines continued to run, of course, fueled by self-contained transfer devices which pulled raw energy through from other dimensions. Parts of the subterranean tubeway system survived since its tunnels and cars were powered by these forces. The seas roared into some of the tunnels, of course, while others were choked with lava or were folded into oblivion through the birth-agonies of the continents. Slowly Tékumel’s survivors began to learn the techniques of agriculture and a less technological way of life. Mankind and his allies survived and eventually prospered once again in spite of all that the elements and an angry Fate could do to them. It is said -- although it is not known for certain -that the Time of Darkness lasted for more than fifty centuries. The Ssú and Hlüss also suffered in the cataclysm, but as the planet stabilized once more they began to see it as a blessing. The weapons and force fields which had restricted them to their reservations ceased to operate. The Old Vegetation reappeared here and there, aggressively pushing back the alien greenery brought by the hated Conqueror. Mankind and his allies retreated here, gave way a little there. The Old Races

kept this secret, intending to use it to gain leverage with the Imperium. There is no other remedy, and anything more than a tiny bit causes addiction. Possession or use of *Zu’úr* is a capital crime throughout the Five Empires, but there are always those who cannot resist its temptations.

Repeated applications of sorcery are either ineffective or even dangerous. If a spell or device does not benefit the victim immediately, it will not do so later, and a physician must resort to other methods.

The sages of the period before the Time of Darkness, and afterward during the Latter Times, also developed spells and devices which cause disease: dreadful plagues and contagions which kill within incredibly short times. Since these are created by the sorcery of the ancients, they can be cured by the same means. It is thus axiomatic that any magically-induced illness, poison, or other toxin can be eliminated by magic. So far as is known, there are no exceptions to this. Modern physicians therefore apply any magic at their disposal first (assuming the patient to be rich or important enough to warrant this) and only afterwards turn to more mundane treatments.
## [1.413] THE NONHUMANS
The intelligent nonhuman species which share Tékumel with mankind were mentioned briefly in Sec. 1.200. These are described physically below, while notes on their societies will be given later at appropriate points in the narrative.

## Ahoggyá
These four-armed and four-legged, barrel-bodied creatures are bristly and knobby They are brown, gray, or dun in color, sometimes parti-colored, and are tremendously strong. Their four arms extend out at equidistant intervals from under a domed, thickly armored carapace on top of the body. Between and below these arms, protected by a horny ring, are the eyes and other organs: two eyes and a fanged mouth on one side, and two eyes and other organs on each of the remaining three sides. Their thickly muscled legs extend out from the base of the body in a permanent crouch, and their hands and feet both possess three digits and a thumb. The excretory organs are centered up beneath the body out of harm’s way. They range from 1.41 to 1.6 meters in height, but their torso is perhaps 80 cm in diameter.

Ahoggyá have eight sexes, but their reproductive processes are largely unknown. They tend to be gruff, rude, boisterous, and insensitive, obeying their own alien customs but displaying little interest in man’s concerns. Some Ahoggyá emerge from their swampy habitat to serve as mercenaries in human armies for two or three years, but they eventually return home. They have no curiosity about religious matters, only rarely join a human priesthood, and are abysmally poor sorcerers. Indeed, one in every ten is a “psychic dampener” (Sec. 1.620). Enclaves of Ahoggyá are found along the southwestern coasts of Salarvyá, across the sea in Háida Pakála, and in a large and as yet unexplored region in the far southeast, called Ónmu Tlé Hléktis. The last of these is an autonomous state.
## Hláka 
These slender, light-boned flyers have leathery wings and grayish or brownish short fur. The head is humanoid but somewhat flattened, with three close-set eyes (often bright blue) protected by nictitating membranes set beneath a heavy brow ridge. A furry ruff at the sides and back of the head conceals their hearing organs. Their arms and legs are relatively weak, and they hate walking for any distance. They also possess a powerful prehensile tail which ends in a rapier like
