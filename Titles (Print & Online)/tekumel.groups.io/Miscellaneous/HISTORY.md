Keshkuru Gama'an founds the actual dynasties of Pk's per se were complicated affairs: after all there were 20 temples to provide theocrats. Some of the PK's were related as clan-cousins or whatever, even when their Temples differed. However, most historians tend to lump all the PK's from peaceful periods (without blood feuds governing the successions) into these 'dynasties'. Thus a PK of Sarku could be followed by a totally unrelated PK of Thumis but the historians would regard the 'Dynasty' as unchanged. There was no secular government once the last Bednalljan fled. The bureacracy was in the hands of the temples who co-operated in extracting what they wanted to from their subjects. Sometimes things got out of hand, and there were rebellions. But the 'Palace of the Priesthoods' woue'). Chai Aijjakhan (Saa Allaqi) was a High Governership as was Mihallu[FS]. Purdimal was a provincial capital [MoG289]. Tumissa was called To'om Ssa [FS260].

The story of the Unborn Prince: Thurrigenda, the Protector of the Sun-Lit Pool, made his way to the north to visit the shrine of the Golden Lady. Stricken by ague, shivering and snivelling, he was forced to rest at the Hostel of the Ten Heroes, renowned for its gourmet repasts, where he met a foreign prince from the distant east. This prince was a swarthy looking man, deep of chest and of voice too, with broad hands with speckles on their backs. As they devoured a fine repast of Ghar-eyes pickled and then stewed in a Dlel sauce, they discussed many matters. The techniques of battle to be used in fighting on ships, the best varieties of Tsuhoridu, the largest wagers in gambling. They eventually moved on to a consideration of their deepest loves. The eastern prince lamented his fate: that the admiration of his dear lady was lost to him through his unhappy lack of birth. With no parents, he had hatched from an egg in a shrine to the demon lady Khashe'era and risen to his present position by finding an iron sceptre on the Isle of Curses on the River Which Flows Unto Eternity. Raising an army of Invisible Seekers, he took the cities of Silver-shored Ta'ashar and Demon-haunted Ejqonte and glimpsed from afar the dark-tressed priestess of the Third Moon, with whom he was entranced. He sought the Shrine to beg for om afar the dark-tressed priestess of the Third Moon. He sought the Shrine to beg for a return of his affection. When they arrived after a month's travel, and had sacrificed that they had brought with, the Duke of Ejqotne was githey arrived after a month's travel, and had sacrificed that htey had brought with, the Duke of Ejqotne was gis given to sip of an Ebon Chalice, whereeat he was seized by the priests of the shrine and had his flesh stripped from his bones with demon-toothed whips of woe and torment. Thus perish the Raiders ofthe Gloom-tossed Isle. His spirit met the Ferryman of the BBarque half-shriven of its baleful agonies.
