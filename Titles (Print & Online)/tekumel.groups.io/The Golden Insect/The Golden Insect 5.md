To the illumined Kadesh hiVutraiyu, Kusijaktosa, Temple of Hru'u at Meku

My most sincere thanks to Hrugash Trinesh hiMitla for approaching you on
this matter, for it brought your great wisdom to bear in this matter.

I shall try to elucidate on the final state of the insect, to better explain
what occured.

After it had detached from the forehead of my dear friend, it ascended some
two feet into the air.  There it hung for what seemed like a few kiren,
though it was only a moments or two.  As I mentioned, in my letter, its eyes
were a deep green at this point.  Green like the sickly vines one sometimes
finds in the wilderness.

The humming was terrible, and seemed worse just moments before it vanished.
And I do say vanished, for that is what occured.  One moment the body of the
beast was there, with its six wings blurring in the air, and the next it was
gone -- while its transparent wings drifted slowly like fallen leaves.

The house priest still possesses those wings, as well as the box and
pyramid.  They are kept within special wards, I am told, though any who are
wishing to investigate the death of Varsu are welcome to visit their
location and examine them.  Of course, precautions and security must be
observed during those visitations.

To me, the method by which the insect vanished does not speak of breaking
apart nor becoming visible.  The wings seemed cleanly severed, or perhaps
detached, moments before it was no longer in the room.

I thank you for your interest in this, and the thoughts you have placed with
me.  I look forward to hearing of anything further my observations may aid
in learning.
