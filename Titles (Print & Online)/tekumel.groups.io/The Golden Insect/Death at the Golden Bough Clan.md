To the most illumined and erudite scholars,

I beseech your aid in uncovering the mystery of the death of my good friend, Varsu hiMrityatlaku of Golden Bough.

Varsu hiMrityatlaku was laid low, after acquiring a gift from one of his compatriots -- whom, unfortunately, none seem to know the identity of. It was a tradition, between us, that when unknown gifts were received the other was always present. Thus, should misfortune befall one of us, there was a witness to the proceedings. It was in this way that I was in attendance at the death of my friend.

He was receiving a guest, on a cool spring night, and had requested that I wait in my customary spot: A hidden closet behind a thin wall, where I could spy out through a set of peep-holes. I could not see the guest, from where I stood, nor could I determine anything of their voice save for a monotone sound of it.

What I saw was a set of large gloved hands place a colourful box upon the desk of my friend. Varsu spoke, as if with a long time ally, and I could hear no subterfuge to his voice. At length, my friend bid the guest farewell, without ever having used their name.

After some time, he glanced in my direction and smiled. He seemed unconcerned as he opened the box and there, sitting within, was a small stone pyramid. It was of three, smoothly joined, layers: Brown on the bottom, sea green in the middle, and ivory or bone to form the point.

When it was free of the box, the edges split open, and I heard a humming from the interior. Like a dozen locusts all clinging to the inside walls, the force of their wings brought vibration to the pyramid and the desk upon which it sat. The humming felt not with the ears but within the bones and behind my teeth. Then the sides fell out, revealing that the pyramid itself was a box containing yet another object.

The locusts or rather the single beetle, for that is all that was within despite the noise, was shimmering gold in colour. Solid, like the metal, not some animal mimicry. Its back plating folded, pleating sideways from the middle, and as this moved aside, six glittering wings flicked out into three spaced sets. The thing's eight legs clawed at the air as the transparent wings hummed and brought it aloft.

A smoky scent drifted through the room, as the beetle took wing. Burnt honey and dná, it was acrid; like the smell itself was yet another assault upon the body.

Its four baleful blue eyes regarded my friend, and before either he or myself could react, the thing was on him -- its eight limbs clinging to his forehead. A proboscis, an insectoid drill, then burrowed under his skin and my friend's eyes rolled up as his expression mixed between pain and ecstasy.

Baleful blue eyes became green, as my friend lost consciousness. Lifting from his forehead, the thing shed its wings and vanished. The transparent remnants fluttering towards the ground with the last dying breathe of my dearest friend.

Since that time, I have done my best to uncover what this creature was or who might have sent it. What meager motes of information I have uncovered are summarized below.

With the aid of good friends, I have tracked down records detailing the appearance of the pyramids. These records, only a few handfuls in total, are spaced through recorded time. It appears that they are somehow related to Tsámra, and Púrdimal as the majority of the pyramids seem to have appeared in those areas. As well, I was able to find record of a few sightings in the City of Sárku, and three travel logs indicating their discovery in an ancient Salarvyáni ruin.

A more recent entry indicated that a Lord Hejjeku hiKadesh had recently acquired one, and if this is the case he should be warned. If any amongst you know of him, please pass along the danger he may be in by owning such an object. Sadly, I could find no notes on where this man could be found.

The most disturbing reference I found was from a century-old manuscript that indicated that somewhere in the underworld beneath Béy Sü there was a great room. Within this room were found hundreds upon hundreds of small, tri-coloured stone pyramids. It also states that a number of these were removed and brought to the surface. The idea of thousands of these insects within the great city brings fear to my heart. Perhaps fortunately, the storeroom has long since been lost in the shifting passages.

Should any of this information lead any of you to further hints upon the matter, I would be so very gracious if that should find its way to me. He was a great man, to both his clan and his friends. I am sure that any aid that leads to the cause, and perhaps further to restitution, would be well rewarded.

Tsemel hiTlekune, Purple Gem Clan

To the Most Noble and Honored Tsemel hiTlekune, Purple Gem.

My deepest condolences and commiserations on the lost of you dear friend. Know that I will make an offering this day at the temple of Qón to beg protections and guidance for the lamented Varsu hiMrityatlaku's further journeying.

Forgive me for daring to speak on this matter, as I know in my youth and lowly rank it is unseemly to speak before my betters can address your needs, but I am moved by the teachings of my elders and by this sad tale to offer what little learning I have. I fear I will likely ask more questions than I shall answer, but questions light the path to final illumination.

Please know that I have asked my master, the wise if stern Ng'talu hiVashemne, Dark Flame, Kusijaktodali here at the Portico of Whispered Enuciations, Temple of the Black Hand, to peruse your missive. I may have his reactions before this ink dries.

When you say "I saw, was a set of large gloved hands place a colourful box upon the desk of my friend." I must ask, were these unusually large hands? Did you note the movement of five fingers rather than three or four or dare I ask...six? And a monotone voice you say?

I take it your friend was a noble official or military man? He was not distracted by the learnings of the arcane? What can you tell me of the precautions and wards regularly maintained by his house priest? Or was it the practice to only accept gifts personally from the most trusted of acquaintances? Did the house priest detect any emanations or traces of other planar power when he or she properly performed the Perception of the Energies?

"It was of three, smoothly joined, layers: Brown on the bottom, sea green in the middle, and ivory or bone to form the point."

I would suspect that the colors may be significant. They question is how? Related to the astrological signs of the person who delivered it? Of the victim? Of the Gods or demons involved? If as you say these pyramids are many and old, then the actors in our drama are not the link. Perhaps the Bodies of the Heavens...Sárku's brown Ülétl, Dlamélish’s green Gayél, and Hnálla’s yellowish-white Tuléng? Or is it truly bone...no I dare not think. However these are associations any child at play could make. I would suspect a deeper, hidden association. Let us not forget the possibility of foreign demons, oft worshipped as "gods" by the outlying barbarian nations or the weak Livyáni. I fear my education has but begun in the areas of the demons of the outer darks, and I can be of little help here, although I shall consult what texts I may wheedle out of my elder students. There is one here who is deeply immersed in these studies and his den-den debt to be is substantial.

Your description "humming felt not with the ears but within the bones and behind my teeth" and "the single beetle, for that is all that was within despite the noise, was shimmering gold in colour" fills me with dread.

A beetle? Like unto that sacred to my Lord's Lord? Yet gold you say? The colour sacred to Lord Belkhánu? Again these leaps are too easy and too clumsy. I would suspect a deeper mystery. If these symbols have meaning it is a twisted and subtle one that my poor reasoning is not equal too.

Yet you saw "Solid, like the metal, not some animal mimicry". I fear I do not fully understand, my reading of your fine words being insufficient. Are you saying that it did not look alike to you? That it could have even been a construct? A sorcerous toy or a weapon devised by the Lords of the Latter Times, or dare I even speak...the Ancients? Is this how they slew their enemies? The legends say their power, their subtlety, and, it is rumored, their madness was without parallel. Dare I ask...I must...how carefully did the authorities and the priests examine the honored dead? Is it certain that he is dead and not laid low by some sorcery or poison delivered by the creature or the device? Could he be wearing but a semblance of death? I mean no disrespect.

Six wings and eight legs? I fear my learning of the natural world is even more feeble than my understanding of religious ritual and proper theology.

I dare not speak of the numerology of the sacred numbers of six and eight. What manner of insect is this thing most like? I know of no insect with eight legs save for some varieties of the Atlun-spider. What you describe sounds terrifyingly like "The Leech", the fearsome Ngrútha, save this horrid thing of nightmares is 10 feet long more!

I fear I shall not sleep well on my dormitory mat after your description of an insectoid drill, then burrowed under his skin and my friend's eyes rolled up as his expression mixed between pain and ecstasy".

Again the mind leaps to fears of an unknown toxin or, Mighty Grugánu forefend, the possession of your friend by sorcerous or demonic means. This must be investigated! Perhaps it is not too late if the bákte is preserved, the chusétl is helplessly wandering, the hlákme is trapped or restrained, and the balétl waits for the outcome of this drama.

Your investigations have mentioned Tsámra, thus a possible connection with the shadow gods and the demons revered by the Livyáni, and Púrdimal whose roots are very deep indeed. If these are the same pyramids they are indeed old.

Alas, I fear that this is all I can offer at this time. Perhaps soon my elders will speak and put us on the right path. If I may be of any small service, please allow me the honor of doing what I can in your service. Your offer to the effect of "any aid that leads to the cause, and perhaps further to restitution, would be well rewarded" is quite kind, but as you know Noble Action calls to all those of proper breeding to assist in exposing a foul and ignoble deed such as cowardly murder, and the bringing to justice of any bússan assassin. The very survival of the Empire and all the traditions we revere demand it. Thus rewards for proper behavior are unnecessary.

Humbly written this day,

Su'uzur hiMneleth, 4th Circle Priest of Grugánu, Iron Helm

PS. My master has returned and spoken to me. He, as always, has kindly turned this time into a opportunity to impart a lesson which I will remember, and perhaps pass on to my students if one day I earn a proctorship. Still smarting under the points of emphasis, made with his equally agile tongue and cane allow me to summarize his points, replacing his occasional word which may be applied to a insufficient student but should not be applied to a noble person of your status.

I shall avoid his opinions as to the wisdom of the practices of accepting gifts of unknown provenance and the, shall we say, less than wished-for level of duty exhibited by house priests of the Golden Bough. I must insist that the less than temperate statements made by my master as to the skill, intellect, training, competence, and sobriety of the Tlomtlanyal affiliated and trained sorcerous guardians must be attributed to the heart-rending grief he feels at the loss of the noble Varsu. It is but his sorrow speaking. He does remind the mighty Golden Bough that certain protective amulets, talismans, and wards are assumed to be in place for eventualities such as this, when dealing with the unknown. He states he would not insult said worthies by lecturing at length about the Triangle of Being Repelled Forever, The Ward of I'ussuane, and so on. His statements were brief, other than the lessons to students to learn from these...events, (to be careful and methodical, perspicacious and suspicious, and to never shirk from proper research and proper warding diagrammes and ritual, and so on) but he is of the opinion that, with this limited information to go on, that this device, for that is what it is, he says, is indeed an infernal plaything of the Latter Times, and that some perverse Wizard made these devices to steal the hlákme of the victim, and to spirit it off to another place where it may be toyed with, used, tormented, or even treasured, like a fine piece of First Imperium sculpture, to be admired for a time, and then forgotten on a dusty shelf. He says you may yet find and return your friend...if you are swift and wise. I fear that I do not understand much of what he is saying, but I write this as well as I can. Do you envy me my studies at his knee?

I look forward to hearing what other things the Wise might say.

Su'uzur

To the noble Tsemel hiTlekune, Purple Gem

From Kadesh hiVutraiyu, Kusijaktosa (senior scholar), Temple of Hrü’ü at Mekú

(Tlaksa hiVirida, his scribe)

Most noble Sir -

The name and honorable achievements of your friend are known to me, and it is with great sadness that I heard of his passing. I was given a copy of your letter by my friend, Hrugash Trinesh hiMitla, who asked me if I would assist you with any insight I might bring to bear.

Although the specific device you describe is not known to me, I have seen similar simulacra in the possession of my Temple's scholars. They are devices that date from the Latter Times, as near as we can tell, and were the playthings of the lords of that time. Like the Ru'un, we believe that these puissant sorcerers could change the behavior of these devices, but sadly, this knowledge has been lost in the intervening centuries.

However, I have never heard of one being trained to attack. Certainly, this device was intended for assassination. I was particularly intrigued by the mention of gloves. It is not a common sartorial practice here in Mekú, and it stands out. I suspect that the device was set to activate when touched with the bare flesh of the victim, and may even have used that contact to mark your friend for death.

I have also never heard of one of these devices "disappearing", as you say. A more technical description would be helpful. It is unclear if the device came apart into pieces too small to be seen, or if it shifted in a planar fashion, or if it became invisible. Also, have you examined the box, and the remains of the pyramid, or have they "disappeared" as well? The various forms of disapparation and their associated visual effects are an area of particular interest for me; please forgive my impatience on this point.

I would not worry about the existence of more of these killer devices. In all ways, this to me looks like an attack specifically directed towards your friend, and I would look towards his enemies, and especially his other friends for more information regarding this fatal gift.

I hope that in some small way my wisdom can ameliorate your grief.

(Signed)

(His Mark)

Su'uzar hiMneleth, Iron Helm

It pleases me greatly to have received response to my letter, and with that response comes questions that I shall do my best to answer.

I do apologize for some of my previous letter, for I am sometimes known to be too poetic at times -- in such a way that I might accidentally obscure my meaning. This particular affliction taking me during times of high emotion.

In your letter you ask about the nature of the gloves I saw. Please understand that my memory is somewhat hazy surrounding the preceding events, but I am sure that the gloves were of hide. Brown, as sturdy gloves intended for work. Perhaps a smith's, save for they were exquisitely made and well fashioned. I noticed no particularities in the number, nor size, of fingers. As far as I can remember, they bore no marks that might make them other than unremarkable.

Given Varsu's reactions to this unknown assassin, he must have been at least a long-term acquaintance. I knew my friend well, and could read the signs of his expressions. This guest was someone whom he trusted, but since I am not privy to a list of such people, I cannot narrow down or even investigate directly who this might be.

My friend, Varsu hiMrityatlaku, was distracted by a great many activities. It is known to me that he had some understanding of matters arcane, for this was the purpose of a recent expedition into the underworld beneath Béy Sü.

As to the wards and precautions, I know there were many – particularly within that room in which he entertained guests -- but I do not know their nature. Such matters, try as I might, are difficult for me to understand with any clarity.

Now that my memory is upon it, I do remember one item that may be of significance. Above the sole visible door to the room was a complex symbol, which my friend kept carefully drawn. Each day he would examine the sigil, and redraw any small part that did not satisfy his critical eye. Upon the eve of my friend's death, I do not remember seeing the sigil above the door.

I know that Varsu would not have allowed it to be removed, and as he could see it from where he sat, he would not be unaware if it had vanished. To me, then, this means it vanished after some point at which my friend's attention was distracted. Perhaps somehow removed by the guest as they retired from Varsu's presence?

You question the nature of the colour of the beetle, when I mentioned that it was "Solid, like the metal, not animal mimicry." What I had meant to say is that, in nature, an animal quite often takes the aspect of a material. Blues, greens, and golds, are common amongst insects. However, the quality of the colour belies its nature, revealing it to be of an insect and not the metal itself. This creature that my dear friend succumbed to was of purest colour, such that I could discern no hint that it might not actually be made of that material.

Yet, to clear a point, I saw no indication of mechanation. The joints moved smooth, like any insect, and where its six wings attached I could see ropy sinew of muscle. If this truly be a construct of some Later Time Wizard, then they were crafters of great skill for the insect was terrible in its beauty.

Should this parchment find useful information for you, so that you might better understand the gravity of what has transpired, I will be pleased. If it, further, reveals secrets as yet unknown then I will overjoyed.

Tsemel hiTlekune, Purple Gem Clan

To the illumined Kadesh hiVutraiyu, Kusijaktosa, Temple of Hrü’ü at Mekú

My most sincere thanks to Hrugash Trinesh hiMitla for approaching you on this matter, for it brought your great wisdom to bear in this matter.

I shall try to elucidate on the final state of the insect, to better explain what occurred.

After it had detached from the forehead of my dear friend, it ascended some two feet into the air. There it hung for what seemed like a few kirén, though it was only a moment or two. As I mentioned, in my letter, its eyes were a deep green at this point. Green like the sickly vines one sometimes finds in the wilderness.

The humming was terrible, and seemed worse just moments before it vanished. And I do say vanished, for that is what occurred. One moment the body of the beast was there, with its six wings blurring in the air, and the next it was gone -- while its transparent wings drifted slowly like fallen leaves.

The house priest still possesses those wings, as well as the box and pyramid. They are kept within special wards, I am told, though any who are wishing to investigate the death of Varsu are welcome to visit their location and examine them. Of course, precautions and security must be observed during those visitations.

To me, the method by which the insect vanished does not speak of breaking apart or becoming invisible. The wings seemed cleanly severed, or perhaps detached, moments before it was no longer in the room.

I thank you for your interest in this, and the thoughts you have placed with me. I look forward to hearing of anything further my observations may aid in learning.

Tsemel hiTlekune, Purple Gem

<unaddressed>

I prostrate myself before you, and offer up these words to appease any anger that might be brought by my presence. I am worthless, for it is only these words that hold scant important.

My worthless self -- as directed by your Noble, Honourable and Wise plan in all things -- has been spending its waking days watching the aftermath of the death of Varsu hiMrityatlaku, clan Golden Bough, follower of the teachings of Thúmis.

There shall be no repetition of that which this worthless scribe has already sent to you, as your time is more precious than a thousand shields of iron.

The body of Varsu hiMrityatlaku has been prepared for viewing, and as such this worm of a servant was able to secret the Sliver of Unending Existence from beneath his skin. The great wards and protections you cast did indeed prevent it from being found when the clan's priests examined the body.

As to the remains of the Eight Arms of Repentant Transmission, the Six Hands that Claw The Heavens are still in the possession of the clan of the Golden Bough. For this transgression this lowly creature deserves the greatest punishments. It is the sincerest hope of this servant that no thread can lead back from there to your great and powerful personage.

To complete this missive, and hope that the information so contained balances the time it took from your great and honourable self to read, some few notes on the activities of Tsemel hiTlekune, Purple Gem Clan.

As is known in the clan of Purple Gem, Tsemel hiTlekune is a follower of Dlamélish and has spent much time in the temples since the death of Varsu. It is apparent that they were quite close, though details are as yet unknown to this researcher.

This lowly worm did notice that this Tsemel hiTlekune has been in correspondence with many learned scholars across Tsolyánu and beyond.

This servant suggests, though in no way means to imply that such suggestion should be followed, that Tsemel be watched further.

As always, your words reach my ears and my five selves obey with question or thought to themselves.

<unsigned, undated>

<unaddressed>

Great Lord and Master, you who hold my balétl with forefinger and thumb.

This worm regrets the time he takes from your contemplation, in order for you to read this simple missive.

Disturbing news has come to me. A richly dressed noble lord, who wore the colours of White Crystal and the temple of Chiténg, arrived at the doors to the clanhouse of Golden Bough. It pains me greatly to say that he then offered forth an imperial writ, and was admitted. Immediately thereafter I witnessed the Most Honorable and Revered Lady, Mrissa hiKetkolel, Hrugashkoi to the Temple of Ksárul, leave the clan house.

This worthless servant perceived an angry cast to her features, which only speaks of being forced to leave the residence before she was ready to do so. Since it is known she was studying the Six Hands that Claw The Heavens, I must assume that this new individual must have been seeking similar diversion.

I know fear, now, Noble and Wise lord who owns me, bákte and hlákme. Not the unending terror that your presence brings me, but the fear that you might be in danger. I perceive greater forces are now investigating this disturbance.

This worm awaits the punishment he shall receive for not knowing sooner.

{A magickally encrypted message to Kasikoi Mriyen hiTankolel, Commander,

Béy Sü Prefecture, Omnipotent Azure Legion}

To The Most Intrepid and Illustrious Kasikoi Mriyen hiTankolel, Greetings,

It is with some trepidation that this unworthy servant does make this report. By now, to be sure, you are apprised as to the manner of passing of one Varsu hiMrityatlaku, of the Clan Golden Bough hereabouts. Reports received by this humble observer would seem to indicate that the device used to accomplish this foul deed was identical to the seven such devices just recently secured in a display case at the Imperial Hall of Relics at Avanthár. These seven were part of a cache liberated from beneath the Soul of The World by an expedition led by this Varsu hiMrityatlaku a few six-days past, in which this abased one had the duty of hired bodyguard (a commission accepted based on my charge to observe all of significance that occurs within the precincts of my watchful eye.)

During this expedition, the twelve men and women in our party discovered some twenty-three of these pyramid shaped artifacts now of such notoriety. Seven were sent to Avanthár immediately for study by the wise priests of Thúmis in that great city who are sympathetic to our causes. Further, twelve of these were crated up and returned to the Temple of Eternal Knowing in Béy Sü. The rest lay yet undisturbed in the deep tsuru'umyal beneath our feet, perforce, for as we exited the chamber with the first load of crates, a foul trap of the Ancients did cause the chamber to collapse, interring the remainder quite probably for all of time. Four of our number, porters of low birth and no consequence, were within the chamber when it collapsed. Your humble servant barely escaped serious injury, being nearly within the doorframe of the chamber when the collapse began.

As the nature and provenance of these objects may be of concern to your worthy person in the near future, this lowly one does now report concerning the chamber and environs wherein these were found. Should a trip to this location prove necessary for any reason, this one stands ready to guide you with surety. The chamber was of an hexagonal shape, with but one door set in a wall facing to the rising sun (as best one might determine it). The ceiling was of a low height, scarcely two man-heights tall, and was groined by what appeared as timbers of some grayish looking wood. The whole was unremarkable, save for the inscriptions on the walls of the chamber, written in a tongue with which this unworthy one is, alas, unfamiliar. Long rows of spiky glyphs ran the whole of one wall and half of another, leaving a blank space. So the pattern of glyphs and blank spaces continued, leaving two such blank spaces equidistant from the chamber door.

A crude dais of this grey wood was in the center of the chamber, and thereupon were rested the pyramids. It is unclear at this time whether one of the remaining pyramids was resting on or acted as trigger for the trap that collapsed the roof. At any rate, a low buzzing sound was felt within the chamber, and it is by instinct alone that this unworthy one effected his escape from certain death, for, upon sensing this, my own thoughts turned immediately to finding and crossing the egress, dragging as many as I could with me, these being a priestess of Keténgku, one Kayalen hiVriyen, and my fellow legionnaire, Trinesh hiTankolel (who, if my memory serves aright, is one of your distaff clan-cousins?) who was with me on this mission.

In view of the strange nature of these devices, it would seem prudent to take precautions to ensure that none of these relics are left unguarded or unwarded. If I may be so bold, noble sir, might I suggest carefully placing all of the seven in Avanthár in a tight fulat casket and under strict guard until such time as we may better understand what possible threat they may be to the life of our Glorious Seal Emperor (may His Life be long, His praises uninterrupted!). Those in the Temple of Eternal Knowing are already under the strictest of magickal wardings, and the Temple Guard mount sentry duty within and without the chamber wherein they are stored (well does Prior Harringashte remember the incidents concerning certain Llyani relics entrusted to their care for the Emperor not so long ago!). Be sure, please, great Captain, that none who handle these relics do so with bare hands! Thus was Varsu hiMrityatlaku laid low!

The relics related to the death of this Varsu hiMrityatlaku are still within the precincts of Clan Golden Bough, and might yield vital information were they subjected to a rigorous examination by one of our more puissant sorcerer-priests. For this reason, this humble one further recommends that all such relics be impounded for study at once.

Should further consultation with this lowly observer be required, he remains at your will and pleasure. The Servitor who delivers this missive has, of course, our full trust and confidence.

Your Humble Servant,

Tirrikamukoi Vayanamu hiKolelmu
