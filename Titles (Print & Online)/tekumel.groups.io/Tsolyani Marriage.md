## GENERALITIES

The Tsolyani are marriage-mad. It is expected that every adult is married, or at least  
wanting and trying to get married. Marriage is the glue and nails that hold together the  
many elements and myriad participants in Tsolyani society – without its bonds,  
economic life would cease, political structure would collapse, social aggression and  
violence would flare out of control, and the world would end in anarchy, chaos,  
madness, and despair. To live a fully human life as a Tsolyani, you must be married.  
Your wife doesn’t need to bear children, and might be dead, or have a penis; but you  
gotta have her.

What exactly is meant by “marriage”, though? For the purposes of this article it will be  
defined as an explicit agreement between two kinship units to cooperate in their  
reproduction through the socially recognized union of at least one member from each of  
the units. Marriage exclusively limits “legitimate” sexual intercourse to one’s spouse  
(however strictly or, more often, loosely observed), and more importantly, it defines  
legitimate lines of descent from generation to generation, guiding inheritance and the  
allocation of wealth and power in the next generation.

For purposes of this article, the viewpoint assumed is that of patrilineal Tsolyanu, not  
the aberrant northern parts of the empire where descent is often reckoned matrilineally.  
Nevertheless, for the most part the descriptions given here could be applied also to the  
matrilineal north by reversing the gender markers (e.g., substituting “male” for  
“female”, “matrilineal” for “patrilineal”, “wife” for “husband”, etc.) though this is  
misleading in many points and may create a falsely “matriarchal” conception of  
northern Tsolyanu. The kinship structures, family patterns, and social organizations of  
this part of the empire demand separate investigation and description, and are  
specifically not covered by this article.

Also, in this article the “ego” or “point of view” is to be considered to be male, unless  
otherwise specified.

Personal Functions of Marriage (for a husband, at least)
- Legitimizes children;
- Secures sexual access;
- Assures necessary balance of division of labor within household;
- Allows for acquisition and affirmation of prestige and status within the  
    community.

Social Functions of Marriage (for communities and society at large)
- Reduces sexual competition between individuals and social groups, thus limiting a source of social conflict;
- Links families and households together by necessitating cooperation (or at least non-belligerence), reduces violent conflict, and helps provide individual units with sources of outside support in times of need or unexpected crisis;
- Increases the political interdependence of minimal social units through obligatory exogamy.

Marriages in Tsolyanu are almost invariably “arranged marriages”. Neither the bride nor  
groom has a say in the selection of their future spouse; rather the decision is made by  
one’s parents, often considerably influenced by their own siblings and parents. For a  
man, when it comes to second, third, and additional marriages, he is typically older and  
has more power and wealth than when he was young, and he accordingly he has more  
say in whom else he might choose to marry.

The arranged nature of marriages in Tsolyanu is due not merely to the “importance of  
the clan” as such, but the young age at which (first) marriages need to be negotiated and  
the relatively high cost of doing so (more on this below). A young person is not  
considered mature and experienced enough to select a mate himself (or herself), nor  
even capable of funding such an undertaking on his own in the majority of cases. In any  
case, romantic love and even compatibility (psychological, aesthetic, or sexual) are  
rarely considered to be primary criteria in selecting a marriage partner. Pre-existing  
relationships with the family in question, their lineage, location of residence, status level  
of the lineages or households, their wealth, the personal prestige of the individuals in  
question, and other kinship bonds between the families: all these are instead the things  
that a Tsolyani family looks at when considering whether someone is a good match for  
their young bachelors and maidens.

In fact, the Engsvanyali legal code strongly encourages arranged marriages. Under it,  
marriage is prohibited unless the “senior members of the houses” give their “explicit  
consent and blessing” to the union. (How these two quoted phrases are interpreted  
varies widely among the various schools and traditions of law that descend from the  
Engsvanyali age, of course.) Thus in Tsolyanu, a young couple crossed in love simply  
can’t elope together; there is no acceptable way they can be legally married without their  
families’ approval.

Tsolyani disapproval of non-arranged marriage runs deeper than simple collectivism  
and paternalism. It is seen as psychologically damaging as well – the intense emotional  
forces at play in a relationship founded on romantic love, when combined with the  
institution of marriage, are considered to be socially isolating, separating people from  
their families and friends. It reverses the natural order of human interaction, the  
Tsolyani think: a relationship comes first, and out of it an emotional bond later grows.

## INCEST & SEXUAL RESTRICTIONS

Tsolyani society is widely regarded as sexually permissive, or even promiscuous. No  
human culture, in reality, gives a person free sexual access to anyone who is (or could  
be) a potential sexual partner. Though limitations and restrictions vary widely from  
society to society, they always are present – legal, social, and moral.

For example, it is already well-known that the “good clan-girl” (i.e., the vast majority of  
Tsolyani women) are expected to be sexually faithful to their husbands. They are not,

however, expected to be virgins before marriage. In many cases they are also not  
required to be celibate as widows, though this is fairly widely expected of them. Tsolyani  
men, on the other hand, have no such requirements placed on them in terms of sexual  
continence.

In many areas of Tsolyanu, perhaps the majority of the empire, children of many  
households and lineages are raised together in their clanhouse, sharing a dormitory.  
There is considerable variation in how this is physically arranged: in some places a given  
clan compound has only one collective “nursery” in which all children of all ages live;  
others may divide the children’s dormitory into two or three buildings according to age  
group but not sex; others do segregate the sexes’ formal dormitories but without the  
expectation of “exclusive space” in practice; many others, especially in larger or more  
internally stratified clanhouses, have several different children’s dormitories specific to  
individual lineages or groups of allied lineages. In most clanhouses, children are  
expected (and encouraged, in some cases) to experiment sexually with one another and  
carry out a number of sexual liaisons prior to marriage. This is regarded as providing  
them experience and prepare them – emotionally as well as physically – for married life.  
Pregnancy resulting from such liaisons is always to be avoided – unmarried teenage  
girls are obliged to take contraceptive drugs, and either abort or secretly give up the  
infant for adoption if they should fail. Thus, premarital sex is approved and encouraged  
for girls, but premarital pregnancy highly stigmatized.

Sexual experimentation with other children from outside one’s own dormitory is  
strongly discouraged and frowned upon. Likewise, sexual contact with adults is  
generally forbidden across the board. These strictures are largely due to the Tsolyani  
emphasis on rank, combined with generalized mild xenophobia. No parents want their  
children associating with people of significantly different statuses or origins – let alone  
forming attachments with them! People from outside the clanhouse certainly qualify as  
dangerously inappropriate, and so do adults: age and status are closely linked in  
Tsolyanu. As mentioned, larger and more stratified clanhouses may contain lineages or  
groups of lineages that feel they are distinct enough in status that their children should  
be kept somewhat separate from those of other lineages, and encouraged to socialize  
amongst themselves. This gives rise to multiple “semi-private” children’s dormitories in  
a given compound. For the genuine elites, their children are raised more or less within  
their parents’ household, and they may have much more limited contact with other  
children.

[Sex with slaves: for male children vs. female]

Like all human societies, Tsolyanu also has incest taboos. These are prohibitions on  
sexual intercourse with certain categories of close relatives. How the category is defined  
again varies widely from society to society. In Tsolyanu, though, it can generally be  
defined as “those belonging to your own lineage, or who are members of your natal  
household”. Because Tsolyanu reckons descent unilinearly, one or the other of your  
parents is not a member of your own lineage. Tsolyani incest taboos thus permit sexual  
contact with some much closer relatives than our own would tolerate (e.g., half-siblings  
by your off-descent parent, cross-cousins), while forbidding sexual contact with a much wider category of people that we would probably consider barely related at all (anyone  
sharing the same “last name”!).

[Note on lineage fission frequently being driven by need/desire to establish marriage bonds between two families for whom an incest taboo exists]

In general, Tsolyani also disapprove of intergenerational marriage and even any kind of  
intergenerational sexual intercourse, unless the parties are clearly unrelated – i.e., not  
only from different lineages, but different clanhouses and not connected indirectly by  
marriage bonds. In effect, it is only truly acceptable (tasteful) where it is thus impossible  
to state categorically whether two people belong to the “same generation” or not  
anyway. The difference in status between successive generations is considered deeply  
significant, if not fundamental, and improper to bridge in this way: it is thought to  
disorder the fundamental structure of the family and to confuse the ancestors as well.  
Note that there is no objection to sex and marriage between people with large  
differences in age – just so long as it can’t be shown that they do belong to different  
generations.

[EXAMPLE: Intergenerational liaisons]

## PREFERRED PATTERNS

In human societies there are two different types of rules of marriage partner selection,  
operating simultaneously. The first type are rules of exogamy, which require that  
marriage be outside some defined group. The second type are rules of endogamy,  
requiring that marriage be within some (larger) defined group. Endogamy rules are  
usually more flexible and broad compared to exogamy rules; they indicate who is  
preferred or potentially acceptable. Rules of exogamy are comparatively strict and rigid;  
the incest taboos mentioned above are among them.

A Tsolyani youth must find a marriage partner who is not part of his or her exogamous  
group but who is within his or her endogamous group. Thus, marriage to overly close  
relatives is forbidden, while overly distant or alien outsiders are also discouraged as  
spouses.

Tsolyani culture defines a the preferred choice of spouse to be a specific type of cousin –  
that is, certain relatives who are not forbidden by exogamy rules, but who are not more  
distantly related than through the grandparents’ generation. While this is the ideal form  
of marriage, it is often not achieved. Perhaps two-thirds of all Tsolyani marriages are  
with a cousin, though the proportions vary considerably depending upon region and  
rural/urban communities.

Systematically speaking, are two types of cousin: parallel cousins and cross cousins.  
Parallel cousins are those related through sibling parents of the same sex (i.e., your  
father’s brother’s children or your mother’s sister’s children). Cross cousins are those  
related through sibling parents of the opposite sex (your father’s sister’s or your

mother’s brother’s children). When combined with the Tsolyani pattern of unilineal  
descent (see elsewhere; predominantly patrilateral except in some northern parts of the  
empire), the social impact of parallel cousin versus cross cousin marriage is significant.

Both parallel and cross cousins fall into two subtypes: patrilateral and matrilateral,  
depending on whether the linking sibling is your father’s or your mother’s.

| Your ...     | ---              | consist of your....         |
| ------------ | ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| patrilateral | cross cousins    | father’s sister’s children  |
|              | parallel cousins | father’s brother’s children |
| matrilateral | parallel cousins | mother’s sister’s children  |
|              | cross cousins    | mother’s brother’s children |
 ### *Parallel Cousin Marriage*

Marriage between patrilateral parallel cousins – that is, marrying your father’s brother’s  
daughter – helps strengthen the solidarity of extended families and patrilines, while  
reducing obligations (social, economic, and ritual) outside of them. Where it is  
practiced, it tends to mean that family groups or local lineages become relatively socially  
isolated, closed to outsiders, and economically autonomous. However, the majority of  
Tsolyani consider sex with your patrilateral parallel cousin (much less marriage) to be  
incest.

On the other hand, matrilateral parallel cousins (your mother’s sister’s children) are  
neither members of your own lineage nor your mother’s. Rather, they belong to that of  
your mother’s sister’s husband. Such cousins are typically either too closely related  
(within the exogamous group, because your mother’s sister’s husband often turns about  
a member of your own lineage) or else too much “outsiders” (outside the endogamous  
group) to be very acceptable marriage partners. It is much more common than  
patrilateral parallel cousin marriage, but still accounts for only a small minority of  
marriages in Tsolyanu.

Neither type of parallel cousin marriage forms the basis for any widely distributed or  
significant patterns of spouse selection. Where such patterns are found, they are  
typically limited to small communities or sub-communities that occupy specialized or  
extreme social niches.

### *Cross-Cousin Marriage*

Cross-cousin marriages, on the other hand, involve individuals marrying either their  
father’s sister’s children (patrilateral cross cousins) or their mother’s brother’s children  
(matrilateral cross cousins). In either case, the cross-cousin is considered a member of a  
different lineage. The practice of preferring these kinds of marriages has the effect of  
uniting separate lineages through the continued pattern of marriage exchanges between  
them. Ties between the lineages are reinforced with each subsequent generation of  
marriage exchange, creating reliable allies and close bonds with people outside one’s  
own household or lineage segment.

Three subtypes of cross-cousin marriage can be identified:

1. *Bilateral cross-cousin marriage*, between pairs of lineages (also called “direct exchange marriage”);
2. *Matrilineal cross-cousin marriage*, between an indefinite number of lineages (also called “assymmetrical” or “indirect exchange marriage”);
3. *Patrilateral cross-cousin marriage*, which results in a combination of the two other forms.

In general in Tsolyanu there is a strong preference (or in some cases, even a  
requirement) that men take wives from the same lineage that their fathers did; in effect  
duplicating the pattern of marriages that were made during the previous generation.  
Thus a man’s wife is ideally from the same lineage as his mother. (Conservatism runs  
very deep in the Tsolyani mindset.) In the larger cities of Tsolyanu there is considerably  
more fluidity, as there is also among the upper reaches of the nobility. While even there  
the ideal of cross-cousin marriage is still dominant, there is less pressure for marriage to  
specifically match the previous generation’s.

*Bilateral cross-cousin marriage*s are found in situations where only two lineages  
exchange brides with each other over several generations. In its most basic form, this is  
two men marrying each other’s sisters. Over time, a dense layering of kinship roles  
results. It thus is not uncommon for one woman to be 1) your wife, 2) your father’s  
sister’s daughter, and 3) your mother’s brother’s daughter. In other words, your spouse  
is related to you on both sides of the family. This erases the distinction between  
patrilateral and matrilateral cross-cousins that was given above; one instead has  
“bilateral” cross cousins. Due to unilinear descent ideology, even in such a case marriage  
with a bilateral cross cousin is not automatically considered incest.

This arrangement is fairly common in much of Tsolyanu, particularly in rural areas.  
Many clanhouses are composed of only two lineages. In effect this dual lineage  
arrangement is a moiety system, and the expectation of marrying your bilateral cousin is  
a fixed rule; breaking it is a grievous sin against the social and possibly spiritual order.  
Given that many villages consist of only a single clan in a sprawling and often  
discontinuous “clanhouse”, it seems likely that a majority of all settlements in Tsolyanu  
exhibit such a moiety system of organization.

Elsewhere one finds systems of so-called “circulating connubium”. Here, a closed group  
of lineages are linked together through a series of paired matrilateral cross-cousin  
marriages. Each lineage is directly tied to only two others (the one it receives brides  
from, and the one it gives brides to), but it is unavoidably connected to all the others in  
the circle.

A -----------> B -----------> C -----------> D -----------> A  
(gives bride) (gives bride) (gives bride) (gives bride)

While such chains occur spontaneously or coincidentally fairly often, they are usually  
short (rarely more than three or four links) and exceedingly unstable (usually lasting

only one or two generations). However, in a few areas of the empire and among certain  
communities, there is a strong overt preference for such cyclical marriage rings. Some  
have lasted for centuries, and may consist of as many as twenty separate lineages at a  
given time.

Patrilateral cross-cousin marriage chains are superficially similar, but have an added  
twist: in alternating generations, the direction of bride transfer reverses.

#### 1. A -----------> B -----------> C -----------> D -----------> A
(gives bride) (gives bride) (gives bride) (gives bride)
#### 2. A <----------- B <----------- C <----------- D <----------- A  
(gives bride) (gives bride) (gives bride) (gives bride)
#### 3. A -----------> B -----------> C -----------> D -----------> A  
(gives bride) (gives bride) (gives bride) (gives bride)  (etc.)

The alternating reversal rule links each lineage with both of its neighbors as mutually  
exchanging pairs – that is, in the example given, B is tied to A by reciprocal bride  
exchanges, and is also tied to C by reciprocal bride exchanges. If the same lineages  
practiced matrilateral cross-cousin marriage instead, B would only give its daughters to  
C in marriage, and never to A, and would only receive brides from A, never from C.

In this way, patrilateral cross-cousin marriage patterns can be said to combine the  
features of the matrilateral pattern (“indirect exchange”) and the bilateral pattern  
(“direct exchange”).

In status-conscious Tsolyanu, however, such a pattern is difficult to sustain. There is a  
basic cultural value of hypergamy, namely that women should marry men of (slightly)  
higher status than themselves. Accordingly, a given lineage tends to be unwilling to give  
its daughters in marriage to a lineage it has previously received brides from, as that was  
seen as confirmation that the other lineage is more lowly and inferior. Therefore it is  
found primarily where there are a number of lineages of only minutely differentiated  
status, with relatively low levels of intra-clan competition and prestige-jockeying, and  
also where there is relatively strong endogamous sentiment (i.e., marked unwillingness  
to marry outside the clanhouse or outside of very similar lineages; or, generally, an  
attitude of “closed-offness” from the rest of society). [EXAMPLES: angry redneck types]

From the perspective of many modern Western observers, the Tsolyani preference for  
marrying one’s cousin is tantamount to institutionalized incest, and as a result the entire  
population is, by those standards, massively inbred. According to Tsolyani conceptions  
of the world, though, one’s cross-cousins are not particularly close relatives at all,  
certainly not members of the “immediate family” to which the rules of exogamy and  
incest apply. The Tsolyani are no less horrified by incest than Americans (each  
according to their own definitions). They are nearly as appalled, though, by marriage  
with people who are “too far” outside the known and safe circle of decent relatives and

respectable neighbors. Cross-cousins are, in their view, the perfect balance between the  
demands of exogamy and the desire for endogamy.

There is a possible additional benefit to cross-cousin marriage, on a psychological or  
psychosocial level. For a young Tsolyani woman, leaving her home and her relatives to  
go live with her new husband, to be under the authority of her mother-in-law in a new  
household and among members of a different lineage than her own, amounts to a nerve-  
wracking or even truly frightening prospect. Marriage between cousins eases this  
transition, as it simply adds an additional layer of kinship relations to those already  
existing: the man you already know as your father’s sister’s son now becomes your  
husband as well. When a stable pattern of cross-cousin marriage persists through  
several generations, the layering becomes increasingly dense – so that as a bride, your  
mother-in-law or perhaps your grandmother-in-law may well be a close kinswoman of  
yours and a member of your own lineage.

The following table summarizes the gross demographics of marriage preference patterns  
throughout the entire Tsolyani empire, regardless of region, residence, class, religion, or  
status. It should absolutely not be used to “roll for random marriage partner” by players  
or GMs!)

| Pattern               | % Marriages | Especially common in:       |
| --------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------- |
| Patrilateral parallel | 1%          | Isolated/marginal groups    |
| Matrilateral parallel | 3%          | Northern mountains; Khirgar |
| Bilateral cross       | 40%         | Rural                       |
| Matrilateral cross    | 18%         | Chakas; Mu’ugalavya         |
| Patrilateral cross    | 5%          | NW plains; Kurt Hills       |
| Non-cousin            | 33%         |                             |
### Status Considerations

Considerations of status and the expectation of hypergamy are such that families of  
paramount status (the ones at the “top of the social food chain” within a given  
community; e.g., the Vriddis in Fasiltum or the Itos in much of the Chakas; and  
probably every other empire-wide clan too, on a local level in one place or another  
somewhere in the empire) are faced with a problem in marrying off their daughters.

As the highest-status group within their social circles, there is no higher family to which  
their daughters can be married. Since daughters “always” marry higher-status  
husbands, marrying their daughter to someone would, in effect, be recognizing the other  
family as being of “higher status”.

This conundrum is most often handled by some variation on the theme of having one of  
the elite family’s client lineages or clans formally “give away” the bride. That is, a high-  
ranking member of such a client group receives the bridewealth and presides over the  
marriage ceremonies on behalf of the bride’s real family. The best-known and most  
deeply rooted example of this is the Black Stone Tomb clan in the Chakas, which has  
served as these “stand-in fathers” for Ito princesses throughout most of recorded

history. The Tlakotani of the central empire also rely on neighboring allies of other clans  
to stand in for them when they marry their daughters to non-Tlakotanis.

## BRIDEWEALTH & DOWRY

Marriage in Tsolyanu invariably involves a negotiated agreement to transfer wealth, in  
some form and in some quantity, from one core social group to the other. Such transfers  
can amount to very substantial sums, and given the general economic autochthony of  
clanhouses, they may actually account for the bulk of wealth circulation within a given  
community.

Marriage wealth transfers fall into two general categories: bridewealth (also called  
“brideprice” or sometimes “progeny price”), where the groom’s family gives valuable  
property to the bride’s family, and groomwealth, where the bride’s family gives valuable  
property to the groom’s family. Within each category there are many variations, of  
course. In Tsolyanu both categories occur, even simultaneously. However, bridewealth  
payments are a universal norm in Tsolyanu, while groomwealth payments are less  
common and restricted to special circumstances and needs (often of a political nature).

Marriage wealth payments have, within any given region and community, a customary  
and traditional nature – in terms of quantity, quality, timing, and ritual conception of  
them. To a large extent, they are predetermined. That said, such details are always  
somewhat flexible and circumstantial. Serious and sometimes intense negotiations are  
carried out between the families, sometimes lasting for months or years. In cities and  
even in larger towns, lawyers are often hired to advise and draft formal written contracts  
specifying the details of the marriage payments. (Indeed, in the Engsvanyali-Tsolyani  
legal tradition, the “marriage lawyer” is considered one of the three fundamental  
professional specialties of legal practice, and the oldest.)

Generally, the form bridewealth takes is that of portable, fungible goods, whether luxury  
items or functional, which are not themselves either consumables or currency, and  
which can be amassed in quantity rather than as unique items. Thus grain is not  
suitable, nor is a special antique necklace, nor bags of coins. But livestock very  
frequently serves as bridewealth, as do bolts of high-quality cloth or silver ingots.

Large domestic animals (chlen and tsi’il) are often so employed, as are hma or hmelu in  
pastoral parts of the country; in fact, for much of the empire these animals can only be  
exchanged outside the family in the form of bridewealth, and cannot be marketed.  
Seashells are used elsewhere, or bricks of rock salt, or antique coins, or bags of  
particular spices, or stones cut in a particular shape. They may therefore have little or no  
objective or marketable value and thus constitute “counters” in a specialized,  
compartmentalized system of social and political exchange. A certain type of long thin  
seashell (similar to the Terran dentalium) thus has a disproportionate value to the  
people of the high mountains north of Avanthar, because it is a key component of

bridewealth payments. In this region these shells generally cannot be bought on the  
open market, they are so closely held and prized.

In Tsolyanu real estate, commercial investments, and entitlements (honors and special  
privileges) are never used in bridewealth, but may used for groomwealth payments.

### Bridewealth 

In general, Tsolyani custom demands payment of bridewealth rather than dowry. One  
cannot have a truly legitimate wedding without having a transfer of bridewealth;  
payment of groomwealth may be practically necessary but is never culturally or legally  
obligatory.

Specifically, a groom and his family must deliver a significant amount of valuable goods  
to his future wife’s family in the course of contracting the marriage, or else the marriage  
itself cannot be completed. The payment of bridewealth is seen as having several distinct  
but key functions:

1. It cements the rights of the husband’s family to any children resulting from the  
    marriage. Children born to marriages without bridewealth are “illegitimate” (i.e.,  
    they belong, by default, to their mother’s kinship groups and not their father’s).
2. It compensates the bride’s family and lineage for the time and effort taken to  
    raise a daughter, who is, as women are, destined to be sent away to live with and  
    work for outsiders.
3. It legitimizes the exclusive sexual rights of the groom with regard to the bride.

[NOTE: possibility of “stealing” children from a lineage/clan by demonstrating that bridewealth given for their mother was tainted/inadequate/fake]

For the Tsolyani, the first two functions directly reflect the conception of bridewealth as  
a type of compensation: it is payment for the bride’s future productive capacity (of  
children, for the new family) and for the “capital investment” represented by the bride  
(by her natal family).

Because the bridewealth payment is so strongly construed as payment to secure rights in  
children (and other “productivity” of the marriage), there are long-term restraints upon  
disposition of the wealth or goods given. This is because if the bride fails to provide  
children, divorces or leaves her husband, or becomes aridani, the bridewealth must be  
returned to her husband’s family.

Any wealth received as a marriage payment thus cannot easily enter general economic  
circulation; the bride’s family does not have “free and clear” rights to it. However, it can  
easily be used to make bridewealth payments for their own men, and this is indeed what  
is normally done with it. Because incoming bridewealth has often already been “spent”  
(as outgoing bridewealth for one’s own menfolk’s marriages), it can be very difficult or  
sometimes impossible for the bride’s family to repay her bridewealth if her marriage  
ends. Bridewealth thus exerts a powerful force to stabilize marriages, as the wife’s family has a significant economic interest in ensuring that marital problems of the couple are  
resolved and the union remains intact.

If a marriage ends, for whatever reason, and the couple has had children, then the wife’s  
family does not need to return the bridewealth which was originally received for. In  
effect, the husband keeps the children instead of the bridewealth. (It is for this reason  
that bridewealth is sometimes termed “progeny price”.)

The Tsolyani groom is not individually responsible for obtaining the bridewealth, of  
course. His family and his lineage-mates – particularly his father and paternal uncles –  
assist him in earning, borrowing, or otherwise collecting all that is necessary to make  
the payment. In the course of time he will naturally be responsible for helping his own  
son (and possibly his brothers’ sons) pay for a wife of his own. A father’s contribution to  
his son’s bridewealth is considered part of the son’s inheritance in the lineage, and no  
repayment is expected or obligation created between for it. However, contributions from  
lateral relatives – one’s father’s brothers and so on – are couched as loans, despite the  
fact that they are also technically lineage-mates from whom one inherits (and in fact  
usually called “father” in Tsolyani). Nevertheless, such contributions create a debt that  
must be repaid. Normally the new husband makes repayments in installations over  
several (or many) years following his marriage. This need not be in the form of future  
bridewealth payments, but may be in other coin. However, an older man who has helped  
his brother’s son obtain a wife will often later call on him to provide bridewealth  
materials in order to obtain a second or third wife of his own.

A given Tsolyani man is thus likely to have to contribute to at least three bridewealth  
payments in his lifetime: his own, his son’s, and his paternal uncle’s. Given that Tsolyani  
families are often fairly large, and given the possibility he may marry more than once  
himself, he may end up being responsible for half a dozen and contributing to many  
more. This massive economic burden makes having too many sons a liability, and gives  
rise to a number of solutions, including the phenomenon of “gay marriage” (see below).

The bridewealth payment is made to the bride’s father and paternal uncles. While the  
bride’s family is obliged to return the payment if she fails to produce children or breaks  
the marriage (by abandonment, legal divorce, or “emancipation” through the aridani  
tradition), her family is otherwise allowed to use the wealth and goods received to fund  
marriage payments for themselves. In this way, large amounts of wealth are  
continuously circulated through society. When overlaid with the strong patterns of  
marriage partner preference described in the previous section, bridewealth further  
strengthens bonds of solidarity and obligation between separate lineages, helping to  
create important and durable ties outside the extended family household and local  
lineage segment.

The constant circulation of bridewealth has given rise to a marked preference for a  
particular birth order among Tsolyani parents. The ideal result is to have a girl followed  
by a boy. In this way, one receives a brideprice for the older daughter, which can then be  
used to obtain a bride for the son. A reversal of this order – particularly if there is a large age gap between a male child and his little sisters – can pose a serious problem for the family, as they struggle to find a way to accumulate the wealth needed to marry him off.

Potentially bridewealth could exert a leveling influence, reducing inequalities in wealth  
among participating linked lineages. However, in practice it creates and supports  
situations where the groups exhibit lasting, durable imbalances of status and wealth.  
Specifically, elite lineages within a given community are able to publicly validate and  
actually forcibly maintain their preeminence through the bridewealth system itself.

Because of the near-universal expectation of hypergamy, bridewealth payments flow  
from higher-status groups to lower-status groups, while women move from lower-status  
groups to higher-status groups. But as the amount of payment is in part dependent upon  
the status of the bride’s family, those at the top of the social structure stockpile more  
bridewealth than they are forced to give out: they are structurally obliged to hypogamy,  
giving their daughters to lower-status families in marriage. There is therefore a net flow  
of both women and bridewealth toward the higher-status participants in the system.  
(This relative abundance of bridewealth goods allows the elites to obtain many more  
wives themselves, which does have some effect on redistributing wealth downwards.)

Because they are likely to be able to take wives from multiple sources, the elites enjoy a  
much broader network of social ties and exert more power – political, economic, and  
social – over a wider part of the community. (Of course, local elites also contract some  
number of their marriages with other elites from outside their own community –  
neighboring villages or nearby cities, for example – which follow a traditional  
hypergamous pattern, and in which they will in fact be the “junior partner”.)

For the elite of the elites – the aristocracy and the high nobility in the strict sense –  
wives and bridewealth are truly a political currency: they receive wives as symbolic  
“tribute” from the various constituencies of their domain, while redistributing parts of  
their amassed wealth back out to the lower-ranked groups in the form of bridewealth. In  
areas of the empire where the autonomy of the local aristocracy has persisted, the local  
chieftains and kings could have up to a hundred wives at a time. [insert examples]

Bridewealth has more pervasive social and indeed political implications as well. Because  
of the amounts of goods needed, some time is required for a prospective groom and his  
family to accumulate the necessary payments. This gives older men a significant  
advantage in contracting marriages, as they have had more time to collect wealth, have  
established more ties and alliances with others to assist in this, and have more power  
within the household, lineage, and clanhouse to draw on such resources for their own  
use. In addition, once they have acquired one wife, her own contribution to his  
prosperity and productivity can be used to generate further leverage for more marriages.  
Within the same socioeconomic strata (say, the same lineage within a given clanhouse),  
an older man will have been able to marry several times before his juniors have been  
able to. In addition, given the scarcity of specific goods needed for bridewealth  
payments, one man’s success at obtaining even one wife potentially makes the task of  
other unmarried men even harder. (In many Tsolyani communities, marriage genuinely  
is a zero-sum game.) The bridewealth regulation as a whole thus supports the institution

of polygyny, despite appearances it may have of “leveling the playing field”. It also is the  
chief reason why having multiple wives is taken as demonstration of wealth, prestige,  
and status: not because one must be wealthy to support them – Tsolyani women are  
recognized as being economically valuable, or even vital, in their own right – but  
because one must be wealthy to get them.

### Dowry

The reverse of bridewealth is groomwealth, where the bride’s family makes a payment of  
valuables to the family of the groom. This is more familiar to Westerners as “dowry”, in  
which the wealth is given specifically to the groom for the establishment of a new  
household (c.f. the “hope chest” and custom of the bride’s family paying for the wedding  
ceremony and festivities). The property of such a dowry is vested in the marriage bond  
itself and is normally inherited directly by children that result from the marriage, and is  
not owned by the groom’s family. In the interim, it can be considered the form that the  
bride’s share of her inheritance from her father takes: the daughters receive their share  
of his property when they are married, rather than when he dies.

Groomwealth of a different nature is practiced in Tsolyanu, when it is given at all. Such  
a payment becomes property of the groom’s family, conditional upon the survival of the  
marriage. However, failure to bear children is not grounds for returning groomwealth,  
unlike bridewealth: the woman is always held responsible for childlessness, in such  
cases. Only severance of the marriage bond (abandonment or divorce) requires the  
return of a groomwealth payment.

The Tsolyani themselves describe groomwealth as being given to “make up for” the  
difference in status between the bride and groom; in essence, it is an “incentive” for the  
groom’s family to ally themselves with the lower-status family of the bride. It is indeed  
true that groomwealth is much more commonly paid in cases where there is an  
unusually large difference in status between the families of the couple, but also if there  
is something personally “unfitting” about the bride (ugliness, poor temper or  
disagreeable personality, sickly health, shortcomings in deportment, personal disgraces  
or embarrassments in her or her immediate family’s past, and so forth) and it is almost  
always paid in marriages across clan lines or other “foreign” unions. However, it is also  
considered normal in many parts of the empire (at least for wealthier and higher-status  
families in a community) for the first (or “senior”) wife of a young man to be  
accompanied by groomwealth. In effect, the lower-status families with eligible  
daughters in such an area use groomwealth to compete with each other to win an  
advantageous match with the local upper class.

The form groomwealth payments take is always distinct from those used for  
bridewealth. It is through groomwealth that families use marriages to exchange  
valuables such as land, buildings, businesses and investments, and even titles and  
honors.

## RESIDENCE RULES

In Tsolyanu, it is exceedingly rare for a newly married couple to establish their own  
residence. The expectation is that they become part of an existing household, within a  
clanhouse occupied by their relatives. Except in the matrilineal northern parts of the  
Tsolyani empire, the norm is patrilocal residence: the new couple resides in the groom’s  
father’s household, or at least within the same compound as his father. Where descent  
by patrilines is the norm, this allows men to continue living throughout their life in the  
company of their lineage-mates and male relatives. Women, however, must leave the  
household of their birth and upbringing and their lineage-mates and move to a “foreign”  
setting.

Where descent is reckoned in the mother’s line, residence rules are accordingly  
matrilocal – that is, the newly married couple should live in the bride’s mother’s  
household. In these cases, it is men who are separated from their fellow lineage  
members and must move to a new home when they marry. In the elite social strata of  
such areas – that is, among the aristocracy, major landowners, and rich merchants –  
one is more likely to find avunculocal residence patterns, where the new couple moves  
to live with the groom’s mother’s brother. This is because men in such settings inherit  
through their mothers but primarily from their male relatives: they are the heirs and  
successors to their maternal uncles, not to their own fathers. By living with his mother’s  
brother, a young man is more easily able to learn the skills and knowledge necessary for  
his future role in life as holder of the relevant statuses, obligations, privileges, wealth,  
and powers that he will inherit.

In larger urban areas, residence after marriage is more fluid. Some couples may find  
that they have considerable choice in deciding whether to live with the groom’s natal  
family, or whether the groom might instead move in with his wife’s family. They may  
also change residences as they grow older and the previous generations of their family  
begin to retire and die, leaving “openings” in clan compounds, economic enterprises,  
and power structures.

Establishment of new households that are separate from both spouses’ natal families is,  
as mentioned above, very uncommon in Tsolyanu. It is most likely to occur in cities  
(where kinship ties are relatively weakened and economic situations often more  
volatile), but it is also essentially the type of residence pattern followed by some married  
priests and soldiers. Certain military legions place strong demands upon their members  
that they live in the legion’s barracks. If such soldiers are permitted to marry at all while  
serving their legion, then their spouse (and children, etc.) must then move into the  
barracks with them. Likewise, certain temples – that is, specific sub-sects or individual  
temple establishments, not entire “religions” – may also require its priests, most often  
specific temple functionaries and holders of higher posts, to reside within the sanctified  
temple grounds. Their wives, children, and other dependents must follow suit. These  
small households – whether in barracks, temple residences, or genuinely “independent”  
homes – fairly closely resemble the “nuclear families” familiar to modern-day  
Westerners. They typically consist of only one, two, or sometimes three generations and  
have few or no lateral members.

With these exceptions, the stereotypical household in Tsolyanu is built around a family  
that is extended, or joint, or both. A joint family consists of two or more relatives of the  
same generation (typically brothers) who live together in a single household with their  
spouses and children, as well as their parents (and possibly grandparents,  
grandchildren, and so on).

[Insert text on ‘collapsing parenthood’ re prev para]

An extended family adds lateral relatives and relatives of different generations – most  
often widowed aunts or uncles and their nuclear family units, bachelor cousins, and  
juvenile nieces and nephews. An extended family continuously grows from generation to  
generation, branching wider and accumulating more members. This results in severe  
strains on available resources (emotionally as well as materially). At a certain point  
these strains outweigh the efficiency and relative strength gained by the collective labor  
and cooperation of the large household, and drives such households to fission into  
smaller segments. This is a regular cycle over several generations.

## POLYGAMY

Nowhere in Tsolyanu is having a single spouse a cultural or religious value in itself.  
Having multiple wives, and often husbands, whether consecutively or simultaneously, is  
taken for granted. In practice, however, relatively few have multiple wives or husbands,  
and monogamy is likely the common reality – though not the common ideal. Tsolyani, if  
questioned, will say that monogamous marriages encourage discord between the  
husband and wife, which having multiple partners (at least for the man) helps prevent.

### Polygyny

Polygyny – for a man to have more than one wife simultaneously – is the more common,  
or at least more prestigious, form of polygamy in Tsolyanu.

As described above, some men – the wealthier, more powerful, or those older than their  
competitors – are able to acquire several wives at the expense of other men, who can  
manage to get married for the first time only much later in life, if at all. This constitutes  
a division within male society as a whole: on one hand, the older, married, likely  
polgynist men, and the usually younger bachelors. Institutions such as the military  
legions and religious life (as acolytes or dedicated temple servants) absorb many of  
these young men and often formally require that they stay unmarried while they remain  
low-ranking or junior members. Having multiple wives is one of the most important  
ways in which a Tsolyani man can demonstrate his power and status within his  
community.

For their part, Tsolyani women generally regard having co-wives as an overall  
advantage. The wives are able to help each other in domestic work, childcare and

rearing, and in whatever economically productive tasks their husband’s family might be  
engaged in (e.g., spinning or weaving, marketing, etc.) Often a wife will be heavily  
involved in her husband’s search for another wife, and helps investigate candidates and  
weed out unsuitable prospects.

Among the disadvantages of polygyny, the Tsolyani identify jealousy between co-wives  
as the most common. Establishment of separate “suites” within the husband’s  
household, or entirely separate households altogether, are one traditional way of dealing  
with this – and of further displaying the man’s wealth and importance. Another more  
basic means of controlling jealousy is the automatic ranking of wives in order of status.  
In the vast majority of cases, the wife who is married first is the most senior and  
important, and can exercise considerable authority over the other wives. Third and  
additional wives may be ranked either by marriage order or by the status of their  
families of origin. This is generally decided by the husband (and his own relatives), and  
can be manipulated to suit passing needs and goals. In larger polygynous households,  
every wife (except the lowest) has at least one other wife she’s automatically superior to,  
and every wife (except the highest) has at least one other wife she’s always answerable  
to. A third way the Tsolyani attempt to control strife in such households is through  
simultaneous marriage of sisters – under the assumption that they will be more able to  
get along and “share” a single husband and household than strangers would be. The  
phenomenon of the ganged-up-upon husband whose wives have joined forces to force  
him to do their will against his own is common enough in Tsolyani folklore and stories,  
and not unknown in reality either.

The greatest source of disruption and instability in a polygynous marriage comes from  
the children, however. The higher the status of the father and his lineage, the more  
bitter the rivalry can become, as there is more at stake in the inheritance. While the  
Tsolyani and their lawbooks insist that such problems are avoided by the clear definition  
of heirs according to clan, clanhouse, or lineage tradition from time immemorial, in  
reality there is more than enough contradiction and vagueness within customary law  
and the courts to allow great scope for intrigue and struggle among siblings and half-  
siblings.

### Polyandry 

Polyandry is a form of polygamy in which one woman is simultaneously married to  
several men. In many senses it is the mirror image of Tsolyani polygyny: aside from the  
obvious gender reversal, it is more common among the lower strata of society, and is  
“counter-prestigious” for the men engaged in it.

Men are faced with, on one hand, the expense of acquiring a bride in Tsolyanu (and the  
not infrequent local scarcity of unmarried women), and on the other hand the  
overriding need to ensure the continuation of their line of descent. Voluntary  
bachelorhood is rare and considered exceedingly strange, except perhaps for the holy. A  
solution presents itself: several men who don’t have the resources to obtain wives  
individually for themselves can pool their resources and share one.

Because the ultimate goal in such an undertaking is to propagate the lineage, such  
polyandrous marriages are almost invariably examples of “fraternal polyandry” – the  
brothers of a given family will band together and share a single bride. Often a male  
patrilateral parallel cousin (that is, a son of one’s father’s brother) may be included as a  
“brother” in such a marriage; by Tsolyani standards of kinship reckoning the difference  
between such a person and a brother is relatively minor.

The brothers in such a marriage continue living together under a single roof, probably as  
they would even if they had married different women; the joint household is very  
common in Tsolyanu. Paternity of their wife’s children may be automatically assigned to  
the oldest brother, or attributed to different husbands based on whatever criteria are  
acceptable to the parties, even when biological paternity cannot be established. In any  
event, such a marriage exerts a powerful “concentrating” effect on that generation’s  
lineage network, halting the normal process of division and subdivision into separate  
lines of descent and inheritance. This can be very beneficial, since if the brothers are  
already so poor they have to share a wife in the first place, keeping their family property  
from being further broken up and shared amongst their children is likely a major worry.  
(Of course, if their wife has a large number of sons, sharing the family estate just  
amongst them can still be a problem in its own right!) A further advantage to fraternal  
polyandry is that there is usually relatively little rivalry or friction between the brothers  
over their wife, or among her children for her attention.

Polyandry is thus usually found among those with sharply constrained economic means,  
perhaps combined with relatively high need for reproduction. This is not to say it is  
limited to the poor of Tsolyanu or the commoners by any means; many high-status and  
even elite families have been forced into it. Rather, it is the recourse of families who are  
relatively disadvantaged within their local social network. It is their own social peers  
with whom they must compete for brides and status, after all. Accordingly, entering into  
a polyandrous marriage is tantamount to admission that you “can’t keep up with the  
Jonses” for a Tsolyani man; while not dishonorable or distasteful as such, it is a definite  
blow to one’s prestige and standing.

Polyandrous marriages are probably even less liked by the wives and their families. A  
polyandrous wife is expected, and legally obliged, to meet the sexual demands of all her  
husbands. (She is likely to have shortened periods of post-partum sexual taboo as well.)  
She is single-handedly responsible for the domestic chores and labor of a much larger  
household than she would be faced with had she been married to only one man (to say  
nothing of a man with other wives to help her). From her own family’s point of view, a  
sense of unfairness arises from the fact that though she marries several grooms, only  
one groom’s worth of bridewealth is received for her!

It can be seen from this that, contra popular foreign conception, polyandry is not linked  
to higher status or power for women. Polyandry and polygyny are not simple mirror  
images of each other: a polygynous man gains prestige and status from having multiple  
wives, but a polyandrous woman gains no such advantage, and in fact suffers from the  
perception that her spouse(s) is poor and, perhaps, of a failing bloodline.

Non-fraternal polyandry (where a woman’s husbands are not related, or at least related  
only distantly) is more common in the far north of the empire, where descent is  
matrilineal and the male parentage of a child practically irrelevant. In some regards, a  
non-fraternal polyandrous union in the north is the equivalent of a polygynous marriage  
in the south. However, this part of Tsolyanu demands separate investigation and  
description.

## SECOND MARRIAGES & WIDOWHOOD

Tsolyanu, like many societies, has specific, overt preferences for marriages subsequent  
to the death of one spouse. These arise because of the desire to maintain the existing  
bond between the husband’s and wife’s families. Accordingly, there is usually strong  
pressure for a widower to marry one of his wife’s younger sisters, and for a widow to  
marry one of her husband’s brothers. Such a marriage will keep the link between the  
families and maintain the existing household structure intact.

Generally widowhood in Tsolyanu sees the wife remaining with the family she married  
into and continuing to raise and look after the children born into it. In some cases,  
particularly if the couple was childless, she will return to her natal family household or  
to live with other close relatives of her own lineage.

Unlike most aspects of marriage and kinship, the status of widows (and widowers) is  
directly influenced by varying religious traditions, more so than by region or social  
status. Most of the followers of the Tlokiriqaluyal have a neutral and largely pragmatic  
approach, with the preference for observing levirate or sororate when possible and  
useful.

Among members of sects focused on Sarku and Durritlamish, the transition to  
widow(er)hood is not particularly significant at all: though one’s spouse is dead, he or  
she is still socially a person and very much “of this world”. The chief difference is merely  
that he or she moves out of the house and into the family’s accommodations in the  
necropolis (where, of course, the spouse will join him or her in due time). While a  
foreign (and distasteful) custom to the Chakas, in some regions the dead are kept within  
the local descent groups and compounds of the living (for example, around Penom), and  
in such places even this distinction may be effaced. Unlike for those of other faiths,  
death does not sever a marriage union. In this sense, then, it is really meaningless to  
speak of “widows” and “widowers” for Sarku-worshippers – their spouses are still right  
there, for all eternity.

Conversely, there is a strong expectation among most worshippers of Hnalla, Dra,  
Karakan, and Chegarra that widows not remarry but remain chaste and solitary for the  
remainder of their life – “faithful” to their husbands. No such expectation exists for  
widowers, though; in fact, they are strongly encouraged to remarry if at all possible. This  
same high valuation of “chaste widowhood” is also widely found, but expressed to a  
weaker degree, among many families devoted to Thumis, Ketengku, and Belkhanu. The  
traditional doctrines of Avanthe, on the other hand, encourage remarriage of both men

and women. Among the Tlomitlanyal, only Qon seems to exert no particular direction  
over his followers on this matter.

## VARIATIONS

### Ghost Marriage 

A woman may also be wed to a dead man. In the marriage ceremonies, and often in the  
nuptial bed, the role of the deceased is acted out by a stand-in, a man who is generally a  
relative of the deceased – e.g., a younger brother. Any children born of the union are  
attributed to the dead man, and are recognized as his descendants rather than the living  
stand-in’s. A ghost can thus become the culturally and legally recognized father of a  
newborn child. This “ghost marriage” is distinct from the levirate or other arrangements  
to deal with widows in that one of the parties to a new marriage is already deceased.

Lineages or sublineages that are narrowly constricted may have their only male  
members die off without leaving heirs. Marrying one of their ghosts to a new wife, who  
can then produce children that are his, can save a family from extinction. In particular  
cases where it is important for intra-lineage or intra-clan politics to maintain the line of  
descent through the eldest born (as opposed to eldest survivor) such an arrangement  
has unique advantages. “Ghost marriage” also allows the bride’s family to establish a  
higher-status link with another family than they would otherwise be able to – and  
receive the bridewealth that the older and more important man would have paid.

### Aridani Marriage 

Marriage of an aridani woman is significantly different and adds new complications to  
what has been described so far. As they are legally and, for most purposes, ritually  
recognized as men, aridani women can marry women, and are normally expected to do  
so. However, many instead enter into durable and lasting relationships with men, which  
Tsolyani law has managed to accommodate as well.

The “natural” form of marriage for an aridani is no different than that of any other man  
of their family: a marriage to a girl of the appropriate age and lineage, ideally a cross-  
cousin in most cases, requiring bridewealth payment, and so forth. Such marriages  
routinely produce legitimate children, too: the aridani is recognized as the father of any  
children that “his” wife gives birth to. (These are provided by an unrecognized male  
lover, who has no standing with regard to the “other man’s wife” or children. While  
technically adultery on his part and faithlessness on the wife’s, it is culturally demanded  
that all parties turn a blind eye to this and “pretend it doesn’t happen”.)

Because of this capability, aridani women are extremely valuable to families who face a  
shortage of males in a given generation and thus risk failing to meet their obligations in  
the ongoing network of marriage obligations and renewals of kinship bonds within their  
community. By the same token, though, they also create an additional burden of

providing another bridewealth payment. Accordingly, aridani status is more often than  
not pushed upon or withheld from a young girl by her elders, based upon their marriage  
needs and capabilities at the time.

It should be stressed that none of these marriages are considered “homosexual” in  
Tsolyani terms; and in fact, there is no assumption that the couple actually be sexually  
active with each other. (Publicly and ritually, of course, it is “known” that they must do if  
children are born to the wife – as the aridani husband is certainly their father!) More  
details on the institution of aridani in Tsolyanu, however, will need to await later  
treatment.

More rarely, two aridani will marry. Because this is considered, technically, a marriage  
of two men – and thus definitely is “homosexual”, and unnecessarily peculiar to  
Tsolyani tastes – normally the junior spouse will give up aridani status and return to life  
as a “good clan-girl”, becoming the wife to the remaining aridani husband.

Taking a different approach, however, aridani unions with (biological) men are treated  
as a special and aberrant form of concubinage by Tsolyani legal tradition, as modified by  
contractual addenda as the situation demands. Bridewealth payments to the aridani (or  
family thereof) are almost always absent, while the aridani’s family normally provides a  
certain “financial incentive” to the groom’s family. (Because of the prejudice against  
aridani marrying males, the “male groom” is usually of lower status than the “female  
groom”, and is at least by connotation “feminized” to some degree in the eyes of the  
world.)

Children that an aridani personally bears are normally members of her own family,  
lineage, and clan. As might be expected, the identity of their mother is usually  
reassigned to the aridani’s female wife, if one exists, while the aridani birth-mother is  
then always considered their father. If, for whatever reason, a male marriage partner of  
an aridani wishes their children to belong to his own lineage and clan, a legally binding  
contract is drawn up in which the male partner’s kinsmen promise to adopt any children  
born to the aridani partner during the term of the union. Given the irregularity of such  
arrangements and the often unconventional attitudes of the “husbands” involved, their  
clans often need to be nudged or forced to acknowledge membership of the children  
either way, and in many cases the children are practically left to decide as young adults  
which lineage and family they wish to belong to.

### Homosexual Marriages

As mentioned earlier, the highest-status family or lineage in a given community is faced  
with certain problems in marrying their daughters, as a) any available groom would be  
of lower status and b) a bride is “always” of lower status than the groom.

When a “stand-in father” is not available or not feasible and the daughter cannot be  
disposed of otherwise, these upper-class families often marry their daughters off to  
other girls in similar predicaments. Unlike aridani marriages, both these women remain  
“good clan-girls” and totally subject to male clan authority. Neither of the spouses is

recognized as “the husband”, but both are “wives”. Because such an arrangement is not  
felt to be a “real marriage”, i.e., from which (legitimate) children can result, there is less  
potential for status establishment and social climbing, but nevertheless it still allows the  
families to establish genuine kinship bonds with each other. Bridewealth is paid by both  
families, thus almost canceling the cost out (there may be a slight residual difference in  
bridewealth quantities due to differences in status between the two families). There is no  
expectation that the two wives are actually lovers, and while they are normally  
discouraged from having children, they probably enjoy more sexual freedom than most  
adult Tsolyani women. They may live in either family’s clanhouse, and sometimes move  
back and forth repeatedly over the course of time.

This “lesbian marriage” can be considered the opposite of the mechanism for “gay  
marriage” among men, which results largely from a shortage of brides as they are  
“sucked up” by polygamous marriages to higher-status men. While otherwise very  
similar to what has just been described, i.e., permitting creation of kinship bonds  
between families in the absence of “biologically correct” matches or adequate economic  
resources, the marriage of two men is almost entirely limited to the lower and middle  
strata of a given community, not the higher strata. It is among these lower-status  
families that a “bride shortage” develops, as more wealthy and powerful men are able to  
pay multiple brideprices than men closer to them in status. Also unlike “lesbian  
marriages”, which are usually childless, the male equivalents never produce children –  
not even by adoption, as adoption in Tsolyanu essentially consists of the construction  
and legal endorsement of a fiction of biological birth, which to the Tsolyani is obviously  
implausible in the case of “two husbands”. Marrying one’s son to another man is thus a  
drastic step for a family: it effectively guarantees his contribution to the perpetuation of  
the lineage is cut off.

(Obviously, this has a certain attraction for scheming elders who wish to assure their  
own favorite’s primacy within the younger generation. Several well-known stories and  
plays have been written about wicked mothers marrying off the lineage’s rightful heir to  
some strange and foreign boy in some distant city to ensure that her own son will father  
the future inheritor of the lineage’s titles and estate... usually to be thwarted by the  
wronged son’s unexpectedly noble and valiant husband and family.)

## CONCUBINAGE

Tsolyani law and culture makes a clear distinction between marriage (monogamous,  
polygynous, or polyandrous, live or “ghost”, aridani, gay, lesbian, or any other type) and  
concubinage. While both are legally binding contracts, each with set norms and  
standards of behavior, they are different in many key aspects.

From the point of view of descent, marriage and concubinage differ in how the children  
of the union are assigned to lineages. In a marriage, children belong to their father’s  
family, lineage, and clan. Children of the same man’s concubine, on the other hand,  
belong to the lineage of their mother. Such children will have no formal right of

inheritance from their father outside those stipulated in the formal agreement (written  
or oral) by which their mother became a concubine. In general, the amount of financial  
support and maintenance a concubine’s household or household segment receives is  
significantly less than if she was married. This is in large part due to the recognition that  
the “bastard” children resulting from such a union are properly the responsibility of the  
concubine’s lineage and clan, not the father’s. Status, position, titles, property, or honors  
are very rarely passed on to a concubine’s son from the father. If a man finds himself  
without other heirs, he may well formally adopt a son by a concubine into his own  
lineage – in which case, the “motherhood” of the son is literally re-assigned from the  
concubine to the man’s wife – his senior wife, if he has several that are all childless.

In terms of status, marriages are fairly strictly circumscribed by the latitude of status  
differential that is acceptable between the parties, as well as by strong expectations  
about the preferred kinship link of the spouse (e.g., cross-cousins). While the latter  
factor is lessened in additional marriages after the first wife has been taken, the basic  
issue of relative status between the families remains. Concubines, on the other hand, are  
normally of a considerably different status than their “husbands” – that is, they are  
normally of considerably lower status. From the point of view of the concubine’s family,  
this allows creation of a kinship bond (albeit of inferior grade) with a much higher  
family than they could otherwise anticipate.

Bridewealth is not given in obtaining a concubine, but concubines are certainly  
“bought”. While it is difficult to establish equivalencies of value for the goods or cash  
given, it seems that concubines are nearly as expensive to establish a relationship with  
as wives are – despite the fact that concubines are normally from considerably humbler  
origins than one’s wife would come from.

The form of the payment is always fundamentally different, creating a sharp distinction  
in the minds of the Tsolyani. Goods and valuables that are used in bridewealth  
exchanges are never acceptable forms of wealth for purchasing a concubine. Of course,  
the forms that bridewealth take vary from area to area, and what is good enough for a  
wife in Paya Gupa may be fit only for buying a concubine in Sokatis. Because of the  
highly conventionalized and euphemistic terms used by the Tsolyani to discuss such  
matters, confusions can and often do result, leading to grievous offenses and lawsuits or  
sometimes even feuds. The scope for intentional insult is also great. [See the play, Six  
Gourds Bought Auntie Six Severed Heads]

A concubine normally resides with her “husband”, in his family’s clanhouse. While her  
children may, as they reach maturity, return to live with her own relatives, often they  
stay living beside their father’s “real” children despite being of a different lineage  
themselves. This is in fact one of the major ways that new lineages or lineage segments  
are brought into clanhouses: the children of a concubine, while of much lower status  
than others in the clan compound, can be favored matches for regular marriages in their  
own generation because they are a good mix of “distant enough” but “safely familiar”  
and “one of us”.

One might well ask, what is the difference, then, between a concubine and a “pleasure  
slave”? The answer is, entirely in the legal status of the transaction. A concubine  
remains a member of her own clan, lineage, and family, which retain the right to sever  
the relationship by “buying out” the contract (though she may well not have such a right  
as an individual). In addition, the term of the relationship may be specified as a set  
period – for example, ten years.

A slave purchase, on the other hand, is a transaction between the purchaser and a seller  
who is, almost without exception, a middleman with no kin ties whatsoever to the  
person being sold. A slave is, legally and ritually speaking, clanless, and more often than  
not severed from his or her lineage identity as well. Any children of a slave share that  
subhuman status. Adoption of a slave-born child as one’s own is almost unheard of; if it  
happens, it is certainly so well covered up and disguised that few will ever know about it.  
Slavery is a permanent condition, unless manumitted by the owner. Even if a slave’s  
kinsmen rescue him or her, it is truly a “buying back” – under Tsolyani law, it is not a  
buy-out or a ransom, but a new sale, after which the “new owners”, i.e. the slave’s  
kinsmen, happen to choose to free the slave and adopt her or him back into the lineage  
and clan – after extensive and expensive rituals of purification and cleansing!

The four major points by which wives, concubines, and “pleasure slaves” are distinct can  
be summarized this way:

| Marriage                               | Concubines                               | Slave Lovers                   |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| small status differential              | large status differential                | radical status differential    |
| children are father’s family’s         | children are mother’s family’s           | children are chattel of father |
| specialized forms of bridewealth goods | “cash” or “marketplace token” type goods | cash/barter purchase price     |
| “junior partner” to husband            | client or employee of “husband”          | property of owner              |
## BIRTH LIMITATION & SPACING

The powerful drive of Tsolyani lineages and lineage segments to produce enough  
children to perpetuate the line of descent in future generations is counterbalanced by  
several factors – not least of which is the economic cost that having too many children  
burdens a family with, particularly male children with their eventual need for  
bridewealth payments. Accordingly, the Tsolyani try to control the size of their families  
by limiting and spacing births out. The use of pharmaceutical contracpetives, primarily  
the lisutl root in most of Tsolyanu, is already well known. Other mechanisms are less  
overt but no less effective.

Marriage is typically at an age well beyond the minimum reproductive age, especially for  
boys. Abortion, usually pharmaceutically-induced, is also fairly common though not regarded very favorably. Polyandrous marriages, too, limit the rate of population  
growth.

Infanticide is surprisingly widespread, though it is practiced more with the goal of  
achieving the desired older daughter – younger son sequence of birth order than with  
the aim of reducing the size of the next generation per se. Compared to better-known  
human societies, Tsolyanu is unusual in that infanticide is perhaps predominantly male  
infanticide, with “excess” male babies being exposed, abandoned, sacrificed, or  
otherwise disposed of. This is undoubtedly due to the high cost of providing for male  
children in later life – the bridewealth, and possible unwanted fragmentation of the  
family estate. Because of the higher rate of male death among adults (particularly  
through warfare), the overall male to female ratio among postadolescents is further  
skewed.

The post-partum sexual taboo, though, is especially important in slowing the rate of  
births and spacing them out within a given marital unit. These prohibitions on sexual  
relations for long periods of time following the birth of a child are perhaps frequently  
only paid lip service, and there is a fair amount of flexibility in determining the duration  
(depending on the region, social class, number and sex of previous children, number of  
co-wives, and the sex of the newborn). Generally, however, it is considered morally  
improper and spiritually contaminating to have sex with one’s wife within a year of her  
giving birth (as well as endangering the health and well-being of the mother and her  
child), and such avoidances may be in place for up to four or even five years. This  
practice perhaps encourages polygamy and concubinage as well, as husbands are left  
without other legitimate sexual outlets during their wives’ periods of culturally enforced  
abstinence.
