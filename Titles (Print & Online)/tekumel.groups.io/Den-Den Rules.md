_Play:_

Play begins with the highest status player and proceeds clockwise.

Each player rolls 2 six-sided dice. With a 1 or 5, Black or a White is moved; with a 2 or a 3 Green, and with a 4 or 6 Blue. A player can make 0, 1 or 2 moves, as he wishes. If moving twice he can _either_ move once based on each die, _or_ move twice based on one die.

Each piece has a certain value as listed above. Each player keeps all the pieces that he has taken, and gets these paid at the end of the game from the respective owners. If a player has taken all opponents' Blacks, while his own Black is not taken, then he gets paid the total value of all opponents pieces, **and ends the game**. He does not get double points for pieces he as already acquired.

If a “team” takes all opponents' Blacks without loosing either of theirs they split the ransom.

Team mates cannot attack each other, but do not share points, except in the above case.

Blacks can be taken as any other type of piece. The player who loses his Black may take only one move per turn, not two. When his partner takes another Black, he must exchange it for the partner's.

_Ways for the game to end:_

When a player has lost all his pieces except his Black, he may opt to “surrender” and leave the field (preventing opponents from taking his lone Black).

When a person or team captures all opponents' Blacks the game ends as stated above.

When after a time, nothing interesting has happened in the game, the players should decide on ending the game, and pieces be paid out. Within reason, the currently ahead party should me magnanimous in letting the weaker team(s) “surrender”.

_Promotion Rules:_

Upon reaching the opposite corner, Whites promote to the piece that was present in the square at the start of the game. However, when a player owns three or four whites, a white may not promote. Also, when a player has one or two whites, he may promote to knight and rook. Only when a player owns one white and at most two other pieces, the white may promote to any type of piece (depending on the square, as above.)

Upon reaching the opposite corner, Whites promote to the piece that was present in the square at the start of the game. However, when a player owns three or four whites, a white may not promote. Also, when a player has one or two whites, he may promote to green and rook. Only when a player owns one white and at most two other pieces, the white may promote to any type of piece (depending on the square, as above.)

_Special Rules:_

A player that moves his black to the starting square (called _throne_) of another player wins two points. If he moves his black to the throne of an opponent, and with doing so also takes this black, wins 3 points in addition to points for the black.
