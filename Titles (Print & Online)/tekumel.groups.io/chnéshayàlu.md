Chnéshayàlu

# Material Mysteries

In _Tsolyánu, the Second Imperium_, “Chnéshayàlu” is a term that refers to anything that seems supernatural and that comes from the prior ages of Tékumel. From the point of view of most Tsolyáni in AS2354, this means eyes, energy nodes, machines of the Ancients, automatons, enchanted staves and rods, funerary totems, enhanced weapons, scrolls, rings, and so on. But it also means vat creatures, undead beings, and things brought to Tékumel from alien worlds and elder dimensions. It additionally includes horrors that have been indirectly created by the sorceries of the past— mutants and genetic hybrids, the descendants of experiments, and so on. Lastly, it means ways in which twenty-fourth century people have figured out how to use, manipulate, or master the products of the past, such as an evil priest’s use of ancient grimoires to summon and compel a Yéleth. In this chapter, we will examine the more physical types of Chnéshayàlu — specifically oddities, one-charge spell matrixes, and limited-charge enchanted items.

# People and their relationship with Chnéshayàlu

Modern-day Tsolyáni enjoy a semblance of stability, but they have suffered great cataclysms in the past. In the popular imagination, these disasters were almost always caused by sorcery in one way or another. A deep dark age preceded the present civilization, and before that the Chaos of the Gods Era nearly shattered the First Imperium. A series of shorter-lived societies rose and fell before that, including the Dragon Warriors (who conquered the Missúma River watershed mounted upon aircars). The greatest catastrophe of all was the Time of Darkness, which ended the heaven-like Realm of the Ancients. In each case, magic-seeming technologies or magic itself wreaked havoc upon the world. Thus, the Tsolyáni relate to Chnéshayàlu with a mixture of desire, mistrust and hatred.

The Kingdom of the Gods, which ruled just before the most recent interregnum, saw the high water mark of spell sorcery. Its secrets are now lost. Those who hearken back to that fantastic civilization try to piece together its wisdom by studying Chnéshayàlu. Priests of the Five Gods find, confiscate, steal and buy devices of bygone ages whenever opportunity arises, and they use their gleanings to advance society’s understanding of magic. They would like to return the glories of Engsvanyálu to mankind. On the other side of the nation’s bi-cultural divide, priests of the Five Evil Gods patrol the underworld and guard against the raids of their counterparts among the so-called “good” deities. They were against the widespread use of sorcery in the first place. They remain opposed to it today. Whether supportive of or opposed to mankind’s exploitation of sorcery, its results are all around. Somewhat knowledgeable persons group Chnéshayàlu into five or six categories, which roughly indicate the kinds of powers a chnéshaq is likely to express.

# Chnéshayàlu Varieties

The Empire of the Petal Throne is a barbaric, baroque “post-Golden Age” and “post-cataclysm” recovery civilization in which remnants from various more developed societies in the past play a vital role in absolutely everything that goes on. Without these artifacts of far more glorious eras, the complexity and scale of Tsolyánu could not be maintained. Men of action, such as player-characters in a Cypher System version of the game, find, use and dispose of artifacts of bygone ages with even greater regularity than ordinary citizens. Having loosed the last charge of an eye, for example, a character might sell it to a wandering priest, who would then have it fashioned into his staff-of-office. Once there, it would add to that religious officer’s prestige and might also boost his Abilities (either through latent magical energy or a simple placebo effect).

_Kùrshtlaqólkoi_ – Mysteries dating back to the most recent dark age, which resulted from the sudden collapse of the Kingdom of the Gods. Relics from this age include widely varying magic items originally enchanted by powerful sorcerers operating under chaotic and unregulated conditions. At the same time, there is a crude and forceful quality that nearly all the enchanted devices of this age share. It was in this epoch that other-dimensional entities were routinely trapped into physical vessels. _The Crystal Claw of Kúrutesh_ is reputedly an example of a dark and dangerous spirit-vessel from this time.

_Mìtlaqólkoi_ – Mysteries dating back to the Kingdom of the Gods. Artifacts from this three-thousand year period exhibit powers ranging from the ridiculous to the divine. Nothing unites them, except that every single one is in some way cursed. After using a mystery from this long age, roll on the Chnéshayàlu Danger Table.

_Kshamúrikh hiMítlanyal_ – Mysteries dating back to the Chaos of the Gods centuries are of two characters: heavy and overelaborate wizards’ apparatuses designed to mimic through magic the technologies of the Ancients, or heroic and straightforward adjuncts whose powers have an aggregate ability to defeat darkness.

_Yagáishanikh_ – Mysteries dating back to everything from the First Imperium to the Dragon Warriors are of four basic types: 1) scavenged devices of the Ancients; 2) artifices comprised of repairing and joining different devices of the Ancients; 3) relics smoothly incorporating the technology of the Ancients (or in successful mimicry of such); 4) newly fashioned enchanted items that produce through sorcery powers once unleashed by devices of the Ancients.

_Chùstlaqólkoi_ – Mysteries dating back ten-thousand years or more to the Time of Darkness. No spell magic existed at this time, and all supernatural powers were “supernatural” because men had lost the understanding of the machines of the Ancients. The most common of these are the “eyes”.

Player-characters have limits upon the number of Chnéshayàlu they can carry. Those carrying more roll on the following table:

Chnéshayàlu Danger

_Result Effect_

01–60 Nothing happens.

61–70 There’s an eerie atmosphere, tingling sensation, or dark aura around the Chnéshayàlu. This is merely ominous and not inherently dangerous. If this result occurs on two consecutive days, use the 71–80 result instead.

71–80 One of the Chnéshayàlu is destroyed/no longer functions/loses all potency.

81–90 The character feels cursed. Subtract 1 from all die rolls for 24 hours. If this result occurs on two consecutive days, use the 96–100 result instead.

91–95 Two of the Chnéshayàlu involved are destroyed/no longer function/lose all potency.

96–100 The character falls ill as a result of minor aspect interactions of the Chnéshayàlu. The difficulty of all actions is increased by one step for 1d5 days. If this result occurs on two consecutive days, use the 111–120 result instead.

101–110 All of the Chnéshayàlu involved are destroyed/no longer function/lose all potency.

111–120 The character is terribly ill as a result of major aspect interactions of the Chnéshayàlu. The difficulty of all actions is increased by two steps for 1d10 days. If this result occurs on two consecutive days, use the 141–199 result instead.

121–130 Two or more of the Chnéshayàlu in proximity have their components react, either through age-fault, radiations, or direct contact. The Chnéshayàlu are destroyed and a mass of ectoplasm is produced, burning the character for 6 points of damage.

131–140 The energy radiating from two or more of the Chnéshayàlu reacts poorly. The Chnéshayàlu are destroyed and an explosion occurs, burning the character for 10 points of damage and all within immediate range for 3 points of damage.

141–199 The character is permanently harmed. Reduce all stat pool maximums by 5. All Chnéshayàlu are destroyed.

200 A sentience arises in the Chnéshayàlu. All Chnéshayàlu are consumed, forming a device with powers related to the Chnéshayàlu and a personality that is likely hostile to the PC. (The GM determines the powers and personality.)

201+ A tiny Null-focus is created that lasts for only a nanosecond, consuming the character and all equipment, including the Chnéshayàlu.

Secrets Underlying Chnéshayàlu

The rarest of the Chnéshayàlu, but in some ways perhaps the most intriguing, are those that are mysterious only to folks uninvolved in their fashioning. Certain magic items in the twenty-fourth century are not ancient at all, but rather based on ancient wisdom. They were created by people of the Five Empires. Imagine a sect of priests who studied in an ancient temple for years (perhaps generations) and finally recreated an Engsvanyáli “elixir” they discovered that speeded up wound closure and tissue reknitting by an order of magnitude and more. The components needed were rare and very difficult to obtain, but, with them in hand, the priests themselves manufactured the elixir instead of just scavenging it. Later, in AS2354, people who know nothing of those priests buy a miracle drought, believing it to be ancient.
