| James opens with a note about how he hasn't liked past gaming conventions he attended because they were too large. However, he went to Gamehole Con in Madison "last year" and again "this year" (2017 and 2018). In 2018 he met Jeff Dee and played in a Bethorm game, which he recommends as a system.                                                                                                                                                                       | 9     |          | Editorial       |
| Pygmy Folk and Swamp Folk Characters: The usual addition of character creation rules for two more cultures. Swamp Folk are all warriors, as they have no magic (but can use magic items). There are bits on each group's religions, social structures, and military service within human empires (Yan Kor for Pygmy Folk and Mu'ugalavyani sea legions for Swamp Folk).                                                                                                        | 9     |          | Races           |
| Expanded Original Skills: A rearranging of skills between the three Groups in EPT, along with five new skills and an expanded list of languages. James warns it's untested, but nothing in the changes seems unreasonable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 9     |          | Rules           |
| The Ni'ikma Valley: A region within the Plain of Towers in Mu'ugalavya. It's another "barren zone" where magic does not function properly (spells can be cast but not regained). The article includes a couple of pages about the local culture and a couple more with places of interest.                                                                                                                                                                                     | 9     |          | Location        |

| The Undying Wizards: A different sort of patron, each of the wizards comes from a different time, exists in the far future, and travels back in time to either meddle with the past or correct the meddling of others. As an example, one of them is the youngest daughter of the Egnsvanyali Priestking Girandu XV, and rewarded the House of Worms clan for their assistance by ensuring her father granted their ancestors a fief.                                          | 9     |          | Adventure Hooks |

| Tinaliya and Urunen Characters: More character creation rules. Tinaliya get extra skills because of their intelligence and affinity for magic. It's noted they are not particularly religious but will join human sects for secular power. Urunen have only recently established contact with the Five Empires and are baffled by the human concepts of Stability and Change. As usual, there are pieces on social and family structure, homelands, and military organization. | 10    |          | Races           |
| The Urunen: A description of the Cold Dwellers with stats for EPT and a fairly lengthy (three page) write-up. I'm familiar with them from the Tekumel Bestiary, but I assume they didn't have a mention in EPT if James felt they were worth that much ink. They seem to have more metal than other civilizations.                                                                                                                                                             | 10    |          | Races           |
| Ureshyesha, the Tiered City: A city west of Mu'ugalavya populated by the near-human Shur Esh, who are monotheistic, magically skilled, and have a social hierarchy of nested patron-client relationships rather than a clan structure. This is a fairly long article (10 pages, including a centerfold map of the city).                                                                                                                                                       | 10    |          | Location        |

| James opens with a column explaining that part of the delay of this issue was due to injury, but he hopes to get back on a more regular schedule. Issue #11 has a piece of fiction from David Lemire that will continue in issue #12.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 11    |          | Editorial       |
| Ahoggya and Shen Characters: The standard article with character creation variations, which I always like to see how James interprets the various lore and turns it into character creation rules. Ahoggya do not pick a sex, because it's inscrutable to humans and unlikely to come up in play (it's reputed there are eight in their species). Both species are tougher than average and start with extra Hit Dice.                                                         | 11    |          | Races           |
