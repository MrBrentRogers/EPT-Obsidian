	*\-David Bailey. The Blue Room Vol9\#243.*  
A few of us were idly speculating the other night as to the format of a   
typical Tsolyani lunch time in three different circumstances:

\* the first circumstance was in a large Imperial Bureaucracy, say the   
Palace   of the Realm, where people are of a wide range of high clans;

\* the second circumstance is within a large merchant clan house; and

\* the third is out in the fields, where agricultural clans dominate.

We speculated that the bureaucrats either popped home for lunch in the clan   
refectory, or that they subscribed to a type of 'Avanthar Palanquin Club'   
(modelled on the Bombay Bicycle Club), whereby they exchanged complex   
enamelled tokens for the dish of the day from an army of low clan food   
preparers who distribute thousands of pre prepared meals (and plenty of   
gossip ;-).

For the clan house we expected a rather informal gathering over a period of   
two or three hours, with people assembling a scattered daises and eating   
from four or five set meals.  In the evenings the formal meals would be the   
minefield of social obligations that we know and love about Tsolyani   
culture, but at lunch the atmosphere is a lot more pleasant.  We wondered   
if  representatives groups from closely related clans might 'drop in' at   
lunch as a way of showing friendship, whereas in the evenings, other clans   
only visit under the formalised arrangements of fealty and obligation.    
("Well we always go to see White Crystal on the third evening in Drengar,   
and if we don't how do you expect to get that loan approved?")

Out in the sticks, we imagined a pattern of little groups bringing their   
own meals, with a very few bringing cook pots and charcoal for an informal   
'camp-kitchen' in colder weather.

\>\* the first circumstance was in a large Imperial Bureaucracy, say the   
\>Palace of the Realm, where people are of a wide range of high clans;

Those of like social status may gather at midday when the grerat Tunkul   
gongs signal the midday prayers for Avanthe, Hnalla, and Karakan. The   
bureaucracies may actually employ food-preparation clans to bring in   
pots of stew, bread, etc., which departmental staff members pay a few   
Qirgals for \-- or a monthly lunch bill. Soldiers and guardsmen have   
regular "messes," to which they go when off duty to eat and rest. Priests   
may return to their temples, eat with comrades and clan brothers/sisters,   
or buy food from the street vendor clans. Those near enough to their   
clanhouses may go back there and eat in the regular refectories.

Higher officials may gather in somebody's office to eat better quality   
lunches prepared by the food preparation clans. These are a regular   
feature of some bureaucratic offices, cities, and regions but are less   
common in others. It is hard to state a single fast rule. Of course,   
people don't eat with those who are too much higher or lower than   
themselves \-- a few levels of difference is all that is normally   
permitted. Player characters find this somewhat unpleasant: Senior   
Priest X is not likely to eat with Guardsman Y, even though the players   
are good buddies outside the game. People don't eat with those of   
unlikely alignments either: a high official who serves Lord Sarku is   
not going to get chummy with a person of his own rank and status who   
worships Lord Hnalla. Should someone have no lunch or anyone to eat   
with, the most that one might do is politely point him/her toward a   
food preparation clan's premises \-- or suggest that such and such a   
street vendor makes excellent gegresa.

\>\* the second circumstance is within a large merchant clan house; and

Each clanhouse has its refectory, as does each temple, and army barracks.   
Clan members (and their guests) can go in at almost any time (except   
late at night when the kitchens are closed) and find food. The quality   
and nature of this repast varies from clan to clan, city to city, etc.   
Members wander in, eat alone or with friends and family, and wander out.   
There are standard breakfast, lunch, and dinner times, but no particular   
serving order or difference in the foods. A breakfast may thus consist of   
Dna-grain porridge, bread, Chumetl, sweet milk, fruit, etc., and these   
same foods may be provided at lunch and dinner, with variations. Fancier   
dishes are found at higher clanhouses, of course, and feasts often involve   
the most incredible confections and dainties.

\>\* the third is out in the fields, where agricultural clans dominate.

Some of the poorer sectors of society do not have "lunch," however, but   
only a pre-dawn meal on bread, Dna-grain porridge, vegetables, and a   
little meat stew, with copious gulps of Chumetl \-- and then off to work.   
During the day there may be brief breaks to munch on the equivalent of a   
leek or chunk of bread. The main meal is then eaten in the evening at the   
clanhouse, temple, etc.

lunch is less formal, but clan and   
religious distinctions are maintained. Friends, acquaintances, and relations   
from other clans do drop in \-- not just to eat but also to discuss business,   
politics, etc.

People don't normally just "drop in" unless there is a purpose, such as   
business, etc. Friends do get together, as do members of groups, and   
social life may include post-dinner entertainment, drinking, gaming,   
etc. All of this is done within the rather rigid confines of Tsolyani   
society, of course. People do invite others of their own status to   
dinner. Getting together with casual acqaintances or outsiders requires   
a clear purpose, of course.

Members of a clan may have   
slaves or clan members of poor or lesser status given the task of cooking   
and arranging for food. Servants are very common, even in fairly low   
level clans.
