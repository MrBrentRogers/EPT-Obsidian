Episode 3:  “Convention Recap”

Welcome to The Hall of Blue Illumination, a podcast dedicated to the world of M.A.R. Barker’s Tékumel.  In this episode, our hosts continue their conversation with James Maliszewski regarding his Empire of the Petal Throne campaigns, and Victor discusses his recent experiences running Tékumel at two gaming conventions.

In addition to editing The Excellent Travelling Volume, James currently referees two on-going EPT campaigns via Google Hangouts, one set in Sokátis and the other in Mu’ugalavyá.

Victor recently refereed several Tékumel-based gaming sessions at Gamehole Con and U-Con. Each of these one-off sessions involved one of the three following scenarios: 1) a party of high-level characters exploring the Jakállan underworld; 2) a “fresh off the boat” campaign; and 3) characters of the same clan heading upriver by boat from Jakálla to Béy Sú.
