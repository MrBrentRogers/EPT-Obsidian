Episode 1: “Fresh Off the Boat”

Welcome to The Hall of Blue Illumination, a podcast dedicated to the world of M.A.R. Barker’s Tékumel.  In this episode, our hosts discuss the “fresh off the boat” campaign.

The initial premise of this kind of campaign is that the players’ characters are newcomers to the setting of the Empire of the Petal Throne. This framing device presents a convenient mechanism for initiating players into the elaborately detailed environment of Professor Barker’s world.
