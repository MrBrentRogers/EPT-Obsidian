# **Introduction**

*“... I simply state that it is the most beautifully done fantasy game ever created. It is difficult for me to envision the possibility of any rival being created in the future."* **\-E. Gary Gygax**

Empire of the Petal Throne was one of the first campaign settings for Dungeons & Dragons, published in 1975, pre-dating Gary Gygax’s own Greyhawk by only months.  Empire of the Petal Throne pioneered the concept of the “Natural 20”, perhaps the most enduring rule employed in later editions of D\&D and in other games as “Critical Hits”.  In addition, Forgotten Realms’ legendary mega-dungeon Undermountain, created by Dave Sutherland, was based on his homemade maps from an Empire of the Petal Throne game.

Tékumel is, in the truest sense of the word, *alien*.  Set on a distant planet, populated by species from across the galaxy and colonized by a humanity who are as far removed from us as we are from the neanderthal.  It is a deep and sophisticated setting, challenging players to inhabit their characters as true denizens of the world.  Players are encouraged to contribute to their character’s culture by describing their clothing, songs, phrases and other customs.

Tékumel has maintained a dedicated community since its inception, with new writers and players contributing new content by mailing list and online forums.  This guide will attempt to provide a brief summary of setting material, but for more in-depth material, several editions are available for purchase on DriveThruRPG or through the Tékumel Foundation.

## **Using the Imperial Gazetteer of Tékumel**

Though Tékumel encompasses an entire planet of adventure, it can be incorporated into other settings of D\&D with only slight modification.  It can be played as originally intended; as a lost colony stranded within a demiplanar void or perhaps your Tekumel is a vast continent across an unexplored ocean.  In any situation, Tékumel is a new world with ancient, sophisticated cultures populated by alien creatures, promising lurid and unusual adventures for characters to engage in.  Part of any Tekumel adventure involves navigating the setting's Byzantine societies as well as the traditional labyrinthine dungeons.  

At the heart of any Tekumel adventure is culture shock, as players will encounter characters and entire societies with unfamiliar customs and moralities of their own.  While we may balk at such practices, the Tekumelani still traffic in slavery, human sacrifice and imperialism.  That said, players will also find traditions of religious freedom, sexual liberty and social tolerance that will be remarkably familiar, albeit approached from different angles.

Tekumel’s intricacies should not be adhered to faithfully, which is a daunting task for even the most experienced enthusiast of role-playing games.  Much of the setting is left up for interpretation, while Tsolyánu, the eponymous Empire of the Petal Throne, is fantastically detailed, the other nations are left deliberately vague to allow players the opportunity to expand upon their cultures.  The setting’s gods and their theologies are nebulous and often contradictory, mirroring the complexities of real-world religions.  While it might be tempting to draw parallels between historical cultures of Earth; such as the Aztecs, Egyptians and Mughals; Tekumel’s nations are instead a melange of these and many other cultural traditions.

# **The World of Tékumel**

Tékumel is a paradisiacal planet, half again as large as Earth, with a handful of continents, dozens of large islands and archipelagos floating upon sultry, shallow seas.  The climate is warmer than Earth on average, with comparatively smaller ice caps, temperate subpolar regions and an oppressively hot equator that becomes impassable during certain months.  Tekumel possesses biomes are both familiar and alien, often stacked on top of one another, with steaming, verdant rainforests and lush, windswept grasslands nestled between jungles that drink moonlight and primeval swamplands bursting with caustic, purple fungus.  Very little of Tekumel’s original inhabitants still remain, and they care little for the planet’s newer residents.

The skies above Tekumel are lit by the yellow-white light of its sun and its two moons, one blood red, the other eldritch green.  Aside from the other four planets wandering the velvety darkness, Tekumel’s nights are completely void of stars.  Astrologers the world over consult the passage and positions of these celestial bodies for insight into the future.

Only the northern continent of Tekumel has been explored in any depth, but there is still much to discover about the known world.  Most basic maps only provide navigation by landmarks, with approximate distances between each step of the journey.  The nations of the southern continent are virtually unknown to civilization, home to strange and unique peoples seldom encountered by northerners. Other regions  include the southern polar regions and the vast oceans that block glimpses of the other side of the world.

The nations described below should not be considered perfectly homogeneous, each is home to numerous ethnolinguistic groups, idigenous cultures and immigrant communities, and various religious affiliations with thousands of years of history, layered with ancient enmities and friendships, betrayals and alliances.

## **The Five Empires** 

The Five Empires are the center of civilization and the most powerful of the nations on the northern continent, each vying to reach the heights of their legendary ancestors before them.  The enigmatic theocracy of Livyanu, the militant princes of Mu’ugalavya, the bickering feudal states of Salarvya, powerful imperium of Tsolyanu and the fractious matriarchs of Yan Kor.

Thousands of years ago, the mighty and ever-glorious Empire of Engsvan hla Ganga once ruled these lands, the reign of the priest-kings was an indisputable Golden Age where wonders were commonplace.  Though the empire stood strong for approximately ten thousand years, it fell practically overnight, the island-capital of Ganga half-heaved into the sea as a terrible cataclysm wracked the world.  The Engsvanyali took most of their treasures with them, including fabulous riches, divine artifacts, wondrous weapons, powerful sorceries and unique magitechnology.  

The Five Empires grew out of this tumult, during the lawless age known as the Time of No Kings, once mere provinces of greater Engsvanyalu, now mighty powers of their own right.  For the past few millennia, the Five Empires have engaged in near-constant struggle for dominance.  To this end, they have invested unimaginable resources towards being counted among the great empires of antiquity, forging and breaking alliances, emptying treasuries to finance feats of engineering and culture, sacrificing countless lives upon the altars of temples and the battlefield.

#### *Engsvanyali Clans*

*“To be a member of a clan, to look upon them and say, 'these are my people' is more precious than gold or gems or palaces.”* **\-Hársan hiShadad of the Nakome, Priest of Thúmis** 

The most important aspect of life in the Five Empires is one’s clan; superseding faith, class, and even nationality in prominence.  Clans provide the essential means of material support for their members, such as food and lodging, but will also provide legal recourse, arrange marriages, care for their sick and pay for funerals.  Clans will also provide a number of supplementary benefits, such as the lending of money, procurement of goods, protection of valuables, even peddling influence on one’s behalf.  In return for the clan’s support, one must cooperate with their clan’s goals, help advance their causes and heed their counsel when given, it is also expected to contribute part of your income to the clan’s coffers. To be *Nakomé* (“clanless”) is considered a fate worse than death, as one has been severed from their familial support network and is left to fend for themselves in a cruel and uncaring world.  To call someone clanless is considered the most heinous insult one can speak and may be grounds for a duel according to the Manifesto of Noble Deliverance.  

Approximating something between a trade guild and a family business, every clan has particular speciality depending on their social class; such as laborers, domestic servants, crafting trades, merchants, professional occupations and aristocrats.  Each clan also favors particular gods who are their profession’s patron deity; conversion is not disallowed, but it will be a source of contention with your clan-elders.  While a clan’s sphere of influence can be fairly widespread, they are not ubiquitous; some clans practice trades dependent on local resources, while other clans are able to expand to different cities and even make footholds in other nations.  This clan system forms the economic backbone of the Five Empires; though relatively little commerce is done with golden *kaitars* and other coinage, the vast majority of trade is done via a vast network of inter-clan obligations.  Most clans practice their trades nobly and appropriately to their social station, but there are those that will muscle out their competitors within a given region or use the privilege of their rank to conduct illicit side-ventures.  

As clans are not uniform in wealth, several otherwise high-ranking clans possess members which could be considered peasants.  These poor relations are welcome in the clan-houses of their well-to-do cousins, provided they do not overstep their boundaries.  It is considered honorable for the richer party to aid their impoverished clan-cousin if asked; when seeking financial or legal assistance, it is customary for the supplicant to bring a gift to their benefactor.  This is often something simple and within their power to provide, such as a basket of fruit or a sack of grain, though in dire situations, the pauper’s children may be brought to serve in the clan-houses of their wealthy cousins.  In this way, any assistance provided is formally considered an exchange of gifts between their clan-houses.  

People are typically born into their clans and practice its trade, those who do not wish to engage in their clan profession may find employment in the military, the priesthood or as adventurers, but one would only be invited into another clan if they would be considered a valuable asset.  High-ranking rich clans seldom admit outsiders, unless extraordinary circumstances are at hand, such as an imperial decree or performing a great boon for the clan-elders, while poor, low-status clans are much more eager to accept newcomers, clans of the castes between have varying levels of acceptance.  For a clan to cast out one of their members, declaring them *Nakome*, one must commit an unforgivable crime against the clan or cause much more trouble for your people than you are worth.  Such crimes can vary according to social station and severity, lower class clans are generally more forgiving, but even the deepest wells of goodwill can run dry.  Foreigners from outside the Five Empires are technically clanless, due to the lack of a clan's support network, rather than any untrustworthiness on their part.  Regions with large enough immigrant communities will often have parallel institutions to assist their fellow countrymen.

#### *Caste, Circle and Class*

*“A death of kings affects a myriad of folk and so reverberates across the land, while the death of a lowly person affects only his own house and is soon forgotten.”* **\-Éngsvanyáli philosopher Tariné Váyka**

The ancient Éngsvanyáli culture was codified along strict class lines and their contemporaries continue to be exceedingly class-conscious.  The biggest divide between the peoples of the Five Empires is class; people are expected to know their place in society and generally only interact with others near their own social rank.  There is little reason for a mere potter to speak to his noble betters and he very well may be punished for addressing someone above his station unbidden.  Instead, the highest caste our potter will likely ever meet are the merchants who purchase his wares.  The merchant may have frequent contact with minor officials, who in turn, might be able to address the noble in court.  In the rare occasions where upper and lower classes meet, both persons are expected to show the other the proper degree of respect afforded to their ranking or risk being seen as an ignoble reprobate.

Social mobility is not uncommon, with extraordinary deeds or patronage elevating a low-born individual to a higher rank.  Adoption into a higher ranking clan may be facilitated by a generous donation provided by the adoptee; the price is often prohibitively expensive, but must be nobly honored if it is paid.  Few noble clans would deign to allow entry by mere purchase, but the sponsorship or edict from an imperial personage might change their minds.  Social climbers without vast personal wealth often seek out careers in the military, the priesthood, or by practicing sorcery, each of which provides avenues for advancement in social status.  However, the presence of these vulgarians will often be met with resistance by the established members of the class, this is most apparent in Tsolyani society and the most lax in that of Livyanu.

The Engsvanyali class system divides society into a hierarchy of five castes.  In addition, there are two ranks that lie outside the traditional caste system; the **imperial** and the **clanless**, being too noble or ignoble for classification, respectively.  The imperial rank is an honor held only by the dynastic lineages of the Five Empires, whose authority is second only to the gods. While the rank of clanless encompasses the lowest of the low: criminals, beggars and slaves.

**Very High:** At the pinnacle of society are the proud clans of major nobility that steer their nations and influence the lives of thousands.

**High:** The minor noble clans rule the provinces of their home empires and make up the bulk of upper-level officials within the government. 

**Medium:**  The middle classes are occupied by both the merchant and the professional clans, who possess a high degree of education and are moderately wealthy.

**Low:** These are the typical peasant and crafting clans, who provide the resources and produce the goods that are employed by their societies.

**Very Low:**  At the base of the social hierarchy lies those clans who practice ignoble trades, the thankless jobs that make life livable for the higher tiers of society.

#### *Ever-Glorious War*

The Five Empires rarely fight wars on ideological grounds, such matters are typically resolved by courtly intrigues or outright assassination.  Instead, warfare is waged as the primary means of economic growth, the annexation of foreign territories into the imperial domain.  While common mercantilism can source goods and turn a handsome profit, land ownership remains the true source of wealth.  Such conquest is primarily aimed at weaker nations, though every couple of decades war breaks out among the great powers.  Border skirmishes occur frequently, as the empires test each other’s external defenses; while inside the great palaces of the realms, diplomats and spies assess the readiness of their enemies.  Shrewd ascertainment of internal weaknesses and finding potential allies willing to turncoat is pivotal for the early war effort.

As preparations begin, powerful nobles and political factions drain their coffers to raise legions of soldiers, bid weaponsmith and armorer clans to outfit them and hire mercenaries to supplement their forces.  These are sound investments, as the seizure of foreign lands inevitably brings new fiefs for the aristocracy to contrive ancestral claims to territories lost to prior enemy conquest.  For the other tiers of society, military service is one of the most popular means for social mobility, providing soldiers of every class the opportunity to bring glory (and plunder) to their clans.  With enough battlefield promotions and victories, a single warrior can raise his entire clan to the next tier of society.  Even the lowliest clans can profit, gangs of slave-catchers prowl the countryside behind advancing armies, tracking down refugees to provide the slave-markets back home with fresh chattel.

The political climate of the Five Empires is dynamic and ever-shifting; the fortunes of a given nation may wax and wane in time and other empires will quickly seek to capitalize on the perceived weaknesses of a rival.  Empires of near-equal power will play the games of diplomacy, gauging the measure of each other’s strength while negotiating non-aggression pacts or wartime supply deals.  Only foolhardy princes would seek conflict with an enemy empire if there was not a strong advantage to press, but often such foolishness only reveals itself after disaster has already come to pass.  

##### The Yan Kor Crisis

Much of the current state of affairs within the Five Empires revolves around the conflict between Tsolyanu and Yan Kor, with the other empires having made efforts to interfere, steering the conflict towards their benefit.  The war has persisted for three generations, much longer than anticipated, as the powerful Tsolyani Imperium had expected to crush the disparate city-states of Yan Kor.  Being the weakest of the Five Empires, the fractious Yan Koryani have proven to be more formidable than anticipated.  Much of this lies with the tactical and political genius of Baron Ald, once high general and now newly crowned monarch of Yan Kor.  His unification of the city-states of the north and marshaling their armies against the Tsolyani invasion has made Ald a national hero, despite not being Yan Koryani or of noble birth.

Through the efforts of Baron Ald and his armies, Yan Kor has crushed eight expeditions sent by the Tsolyani Imperium.  The last invasion resulted in the tragic death of his beloved, Lady Yirlana of the High Clan of Ke’er.  Yilrana’s sacrifice during the siege of Ke’er was noble, if unwise, given Tsolyani contempt for intractable foes that refuse to surrender.  Since that day, the Baron has been preparing an invasion of Tsolyanu, eager to test if the imperium’s hospitality matches his own.

#### *Sakbe-Roads*

The Five Empires and numerous smaller states are all linked together by a network of massive fortified highways.  These *Sakbe-*roads predate the Engsvnayali Empire, but the priest-kings of old eagerly expanded the breadth to every corner of their domain, and they are still maintained to this day, with varying degrees of quality.  The condition of *Sakbe-*roads is often a good indicator of the fortunes of a given nation; solid stonework is typical, but others are constructed of masonry or are simply piled rubble held together with mortar.  Most cities and other large settlements are built along the routes of these titanic highways, as are semi-permanent caravanserai, with more traditional roads leading off to smaller rural settlements.  Peasants rarely travel beyond the *Sakbe-*roads that enclose their provincial homelands, often needing permission from local authorities to leave this boundary.  The purpose of these roads are twofold, providing an efficient means of traveling long distances and hindering the march of any invading armies.

Each *Sakbe-*road is essentially a great wall, with its defensive side facing outward from its nation’s heartland and guard towers placed semi-regularly across its length, on the other side are three tiered causeways. The widest causeway lay at near ground level and is used by common travellers, armies marching to battle, and merchant caravans of *Chlen* carts and pack slaves laden with goods.  The middle tier is set higher and is reserved for use by the aristocracy and their entourages, high-ranking clergy, and government officials, including army officers accompanying their troops.  The highest tier is reserved strictly for the pleasure of the imperial elite and their subordinates, such as imperial messengers, but also foreign dignitaries of high regard.

### ***Livyánu***

*“Those who know the most, tell the least.”* **\-Livyáni proverb**

A land of sorcery and intrigue, Livyanu is the veritable cradle of civilization, the modern Livyani people dwell upon the same lands as the near-mythical Empire of Llyan of Tsamra.  As if in reflection of that half-remembered age, Livyanu is a nation shrouded in secrecy, ruled by a labyrinthine mystery cult worshiping the enigmatic Shadow Gods.  Livyani society developed in parallel to that of the Five Empires, though the nation has been an overlord and vassal to various civilizations of history, even during the height of the Engsvanyali Empire, Livyanu has remained culturally distinct.  

Livyáni society is highly ritualized, with elaborate customs, some legally enshrined, to govern the right practices of everyday life.  However, their clan structure is less formal than the other empires, with citizens able to move between clans much easier than their counterparts. The Livyáni people always bear small, intricate *Aomuz* tattoos on their bodies and faces, the designs representing an individual’s clan, lineage and faith.  Adorning themselves with runes, amulets and fabrics woven in mystic designs, the Liyvani seem almost superstitious, though they will not say what they ward themselves against.  They are generally less trusting of foreigners, as outsiders ask far too many questions and the Livyani greatly value their privacy.  They even dine alone by custom, family members retire to their chambers to eat and restaurants segregate each patron by paper curtains.

Religiosity permeates Livyani society, more so than the other Five Empires; even the birth of a child, typically considered a secular celebration, must have the sanction of the Hierarchy.  Once the child and mother are rested, the infant is brought to the parent’s temple and an elaborate ceremony is performed for the baby’s investiture into Livyani society.  The poor make do with a simplified ritual performed at rote by a novice priest, while the rich infant is festooned with talismans and receives the care of the senior clergy.

The populace of the other Five Empires know of Livyánu by their diplomats, who have a reputation for being smooth and golden-tongued.  Nobleborne women seldom travel outside their homes without wearing grotesque masks representing the fearsome demons & deities from their cult.  One must have the close confidence of a noblewoman to see her face, a rare privilege in this shadow-hushed land.

Being close to the equator and having no large mountain ranges to block winds from the sea, the climate of the region is uniformly hot and very humid.  Winters are warm and wet with frequent rainfall, the gray clouds hanging above rarely disperse, always promising rains that fall with little warning.  During the summer months, all outdoor labor ceases and people take to the coolness of their cellars for respite from the oppressive heat, venturing forth only at evening to conduct business and enjoy the coolness of the night air.  

Livyani commoners typically dwell in adobe farmhouses with flat tiled roofs and surrounded by mud-brick walls.  Larger dwellings are much the same, but two or three storeys tall and open pillared porches in lieu of windows.  The wealthy live in elaborate porticoed mansions, with private apartments surrounding a central courtyard.  The nobility keep palatial apartments within vast pyramidal temple complexes, each of which is almost a small city, with fortified walls and lush gardens for the pleasure of its inhabitants.  Livyáni villages are all jumbled: no plan, no order, no streets; with trees and bushes scattered about.

One of Livyanu’s finest exports is rope, made from the reeds of a plant called *Vraoz*, which are extremely strong when plaited together, cords of *Vraoz* can only be cut by sharpened steel, a rare and valuable commodity.  *Vraoz* fiber is used for a variety of purposes, but is ill-suited for fishing nets, given that it shrinks when exposed to saltwater.  Even this peculiar reaction has its purposes, as criminals in Livyanu are wrapped in *Vraoz* netting and left out in the sun, squeezed to death as they perspire.  

The Livyani still utilize the calendar devised by the priest-king Kazhilo’ob, employed in the final centuries of the Engsvanyali Empire, by which the current year is 10,039 A.K.

##### Livyani Cities

**Kakársh:**  A vibrant harbor city nestled between the hills on the shore of Kakársha Bay.  It is hard to miss the city from sea or from land, with its brighty tiled roofs and pristine white plaster walls.  The city is the stronghold of the House Inscrutable, ruling cult of the Sea Goddess of Kakársha, one of the three major deities of western Livyanu.  

**Tsupil Hlaya:**  monumental, massive, and arrogant because of its wealth harvests;

**Hráis:** The hill country surrounding Hráis is bursting with orchards of *Másh* and other fruit-bearing trees.  The city is quite lovely for an agricultural community, with magnificent flowery pavilions fed by a complex irrigation system, one of many of its ingenious feats of engineering. Though Hrais is human-ruled, fully half its populace is Tinalya, who live and work alongside their human fellows.  The dialect of Livyani spoken in Hrais is considered amusing by the rest of the empire, given its alien influences.  Hrais is also home of the Pinnacle of Euz, a specialized archery legion that makes use of poisoned arrows, the Tinaliya-made concoction is extremely painful, but nonlethal, any enemies not slain outright by the arrows are too consumed by agony to continue fighting.

**Dlash:** For nearly 5000 years, the “Forbidden City” of Dlash has kept its independence from greater Livyanu; no outsider has meddled in their affairs or lived to tell what lies behind those ochre gates.  However, the Dlashi are not completely isolationist and maintain a vast marketplace outside of the city walls, populated by enough Shen to occupy a small nation.  Perhaps the presence of the reptiles is why the Lords of Tsamra have graciously honored the treaty signed by their predecessors, the Dynasty of Thirty Swords.  The Syndics of Dlash uphold their end of the treaty by regularly tithing the city’s taxes, which is paid in form of gold bars that mysteriously arrive at the gates of the provincial treasury promptly when due. These merchant-princes claim anything you can imagine can be acquired at Dlash’s markets, but mere trade alone cannot explain how they acquired some of the goods they sell.

#### *Tlashte Heights*

In the foothills of the Tlashte Heights lies the enclave of Tkit Tlinet Ses Ti, the Tinaliya nation is a massive subterranean conurbation of multiple hive-cities. It began as a single settlement and has grown 

The Tinaliya divide time into 17 periods of varying lengths according to events in their history. As of this writing, it is the year 533 of the current *Ni-gaa*; but these beings claim that their calendar goes back more than seven million years\!

#### *Tsamra*

*Tsámra- Moist sea breezes from the bay. Graceful colonnades like crystal playthings amidst* 

*the feathered Ja'atheb trees. The afternoon sun makes amber and russet tableaux of* 

*the halls of the temples and government buildings.*

The ancient and storied Tsamra, City of Joy, capital of Livyanu, lies at the intersection of countless roads, uniting the historical provinces of the half-lost Empire of Llyan and is the current home of the Hierarchy.  Tsamra is possibly the oldest, continuously inhabited city in the Five Empires, if not the planet of Tekumel itself. The proud city bears the scars of countless disasters from days beyond prehistory.  Below the shores of Kapranoi Bay lies Tsamra’s twin sister, the city of Laris, drowned by great typhoons sent across the sea from the cataclysm of Ganga.  Much of Tsamra’s slums are built upon the surviving foundations of Laris, the deepest parts of the city’s Underworld descending beneath the water and into darker, colder realms below.  The city is also teeming with Nexus Points, hidden pathways to other planes which give the surrounding region a fertile climate for magical power.

As typical for Livyani cities, Tsamra is separated into various wards, each centered upon one of the temples of the Shadow Gods.  Each is akin to a small city of its own, with marketplaces, apartments and public services for faithful citizens dwelling nearby.   The Livyani tend to dwell near the temple of their chosen deity, commingling is not unheard of, but commuting to a temple on the other side of town for worship is a hassle.  Like most Livyani cities, Tsamra is exceedinging clean, with gangs of slaves continuously pulling water from their city wells and collecting refuse from the streets.

*Tsamra is regarded for the quality of its physicians, whose pharmacopoeia of remedies could fill over twenty bulky volumes.  The music of Tsamra, with its pensive, lilting melodies is considered some of the finest in the Five Empires, as are those dancers trained to gambol to its rhythms.  Perfumery is also considered a high art form in Livyanu, with small vials of fragrances provided to guests during feasts, meant to be paired with fine wines or delicacies in a practice known as the “Joy of Pleasing Essences”.*  

*The Pentagonal Palace is the premier upper-class hostel of Tsamra.  The Academy of Seeking Victory is a prestigious martial arts school which trains students in the techniques of the Chídok, the traditional Livyani shortsword.  The school’s master is Arúmaz Dlévu, an elderly man whose years belie his skill, still able to best young fighters in single combat.*

#### *The Lords of Tsamra*

The Livyani are the most religiously divergent culture within the Five Empires, though their public rituals are reminiscent of other Engsvanyali cultures, they worship an alien pantheon of so-called “Shadow Gods''.  The ways of this cult are shrouded in mystery and only broad conjectures can be made as to the nature of these deities.  Only the Hierarchy, the caste of priesthood-nobility that rule Livyanu are privy to the secret names of their gods.  There are accounts of strange ceremonies within their shadow-hushed temples, rumors speak of Hierarchy priests trafficking with demons from other planes and gruesome sacrifices made for their favor, but the Livyani are quick to dismiss these tales as the fanciful musings of the ignorant.

The nobility of Livyánu are expected to serve in the priesthood for a span of time during their adult lives.  Advancement in social rank is intrinsically linked with initiation into the inner mysteries of the state cult.  The Hierarchy traces its founding to the semi-mythological First Thinker, who lived during the Age of the Five Archons of the Dúru'ob Interregnum.  Leading the Duru’ob people from their homeland, the First Thinker united the disparate cults of Livyanu under the authority of the Lambent Throne.  

The current occupant of the Lambent Throne is one Asqar Gyardanaz, whose public title is "Principal Staff of the Glory of Qame'el”.  A young and austere man, whose handsome visage has adorned the obverse of the golden Livyani *Shi’idok* for nearly 13 years.  Though his *Aomuz* tattoos indicate he is obviously of noble birth, he lives an unpretentious and absurdly modest lifestyle, preferring to be addressed only by the title *Dumúz* (“Brother”). In addition to his responsibilities as head of state, *Dumuz* Asqar presides over the Council of the Priesthoods, and serves as the liaison between the Council and the Lords of Tsamra, a cabal of unknown personages that secretly rule the nation.

##### The Council of the Priesthoods

The main deliberative body of the Livyani Hierarchy, the Council of the Priesthoods, is composed of representatives from twelve of the thirteen Temples of the Shadow Gods.  Each Temple sends four members to serve on this Council, where they are granted posts according to the Principal Staff of the Glory of Qame'el.  

*Dumuz* Asqar has retained ten members to be his inner-circle advisors, others assigned to command the ten Livyani armies, granted governorships of the nation’s ten prefectures, and given charge of one of the Ministries: Trade, Foreign Relations, Roads and Communications, Temple Education, Procurement of Sacrifices, Public Works, Dealings with Nonhuman Races, Collection and Disbursement of Taxes and Tithes, Food and Agriculture, and the Glorification of the Temples.  The last eight councilors are called the *Duru’uba Shirudanaz* (“Brothers of the Shadow”), it is possible that these are the spymasters of the dreaded Vru’uneb, the nation’s secret police, but given typical Livyani obfuscation, the true heads may lie in another of the aforementioned offices. 

**House Rutilant:** The Temple of Qame’el, Chief of the Shadow Gods, befitting the supreme godhead of the pantheon, House Rutilant is popular among the upper classes of Tsamra, but .  This temple houses the original Tablets of Llyan, kept in sanctuary from thieves and overly curious eyes.  

**House Tabescent:** The Temple of Quyó, Mistress of the Grave, based out of Hemektu, this sect prides itself on their elaborate funerary rites, colloquially known as the “Rituals Below”.

**House Inscrutable:** The Temple of the Sea-Goddess of Kakársha, based out of the eponymous city of Kakarsh and has a secondary power centre in Sraon.  The cult of the Sea-Goddess has great influence on the maritime trades of Livyanu’s western shores.

**House Transcendental:** The Temple of Ndárka, the Resurrected One, with two centres of power in Hrais and Farsha. Following their deity’s example, the cult of Ndarka are patrons of both life and death, popular with peasants and farmers, whose funerary rites are colloquially known as the “Rituals Above”.

**House Pelagic:** The Temple of Lost One of the Sea, based out of Laigas, House Inscrutable has a finger in every maritime trade on the east coast of Livyanu.

**House Incarnate:** The Temple of Kikumársha, Trickster of the Gods, possessing multiple seats of influence, including Sraon, Nufesh, Falli and even Tsamra.  The House Incarnate are proud patrons of the arts and sciences, fostering culture, knowledge and other noble pursuits.

***House Sanguine:*** The Temple of Kirrinéb, the Bloody Goddess, based out of Sraon.  Kirrineb is a goddess of life and death, her Temple operates the Rotunda of Salutary Healing, the finest medical academy in the Five Empires, but is also patron of several legions of the Livyani army.  The House Sanguine claims to perform more human sacrifices than the other Houses combined.

***House Ephemeral:*** The Temple of the Horned One of Secrets, based out of Laigas.  An extremely powerful house for their expertise in matters of sorcery and interplanar travel.  Their priests officiate the New Year’s festival in Tsamra, called the “Opening of the Sun”.

***House Tenebrous:*** The Temple of the Shadowed One, worship of this deity is popular across Livyanu, but has great temples in Tsamra and Tsupil Hlaya.

***House Fulminate:*** The Temple of Ru'ungkáno is most influential of Sraon and possesses a great temple in the Tlashte Heights.  His devotees can be easily distinguished by the tiny burn scars that adorn their bodies.

***House Belligerent:*** The Temple of Guodái, as patron of soldier, administration and nobility, this sect is based out of Tsamra.

***House Vagarious***: The Temple of Vrusáemaz, Wanderer of the Many Hells.  A deity of darkness and sorcery

**House Recusant:** The Temple of the One of Fears, based in Dlash, who are notoriously furtive, even by Livyani standards.  Four seats are formally left open for delegates from the House Recusant, should they uncharacteristically deign to attend. 

#### *Current Events*

The Hierarchs are too distant to play an active role in the war between Tsolyanu and Yan Kor, but through their treaty with Tsolyanu, they provide weapons, iron and other wartime goods to the imperium.  Their primary concerns lie in shoring up the defenses on the northern border with Mu’ugalavya and with pacifiying the Tsolei Isles, whose brutal piracy has grown beyond tolerable.

### ***Mu’ugalavyá***

*“By the three fingers of the Flame\!”* **\-Mu’ugalavani oath**

A martial power to rival the Petal Throne, ruled by the Four Palaces of the Square.

#### *The Four Palaces of the Square*

The Four Palaces are the central government of Mu’ugalavya, each overseeing a quarter of the empire’s territory and the populace that dwells in each.   Each of the Four Palaces maintains a large headquarters complex within the imperial capital of Ssa’atis, facing each other with geometric precision across the Plaza of the Scarlet Banner. The Palaces represent the historical expanses of former kingdoms, whose *Du’umunish* (“Princes”) united millenia ago to form the modern Mu’ugalvyani Empire.  The Prince of each Palace is considered the commander in chief for the military within their region, but delegates much of the command to professional soldiers, who are often relatives.

Though the Mu’ugalavyani are strongly provincial in character, the Princes form a strong oligarchical bloc within the central government, their power is kept in check by the priesthood of Hrsh, as well as senior members of certain wealthy clans.

**The First Palace:** The northeastern province is the domain of the First Palace, whose capital is Kurdis.  With the threat of raiders from N’lussa, the northern border of Mu’ugalavya is highly fortified and until recently, the borders with Ghaton and Pijena were of less concern until Yan Kor involved themselves in the affairs of the two kingdoms.  The Army of the North is considered by most to be Mu’ugalavya’s finest fighting force, rigorously trained and well-armed to counter the sheer strength of the giant N’luss warriors.  

**The Second Palace:** The southeastern province is the domain of the Second Palace, whose capital is Kheris.  The Second Palace is considerably wealthy from maritime trade, but also on the frontlines of any conflicts with Tsolyanu to the east.  Centuries ago, the Chakas were once part of the Second Palace’s holdings, but were lost to Tsolyani conquest.  The Army of the East grimly remembers the humiliation they suffered at the hands of Tsolyani legions and eagerly await the opportunity to repay their defeats.

**The Third Palace:** The southwestern province is the domain of the Third Palace, whose capital is Trahlu.  The winding southern frontier is difficult enough to patrol, doubly so with the Livyani periodically testing their defenses.  The Army of the South possesses more war magicians than the others combined, but as the Mu’ugalavyani are generally indifferent to the use of magic in warfare, they have had little opportunity to gain honor in battle.

**The Fourth Palace:** The northwestern province is the domain of the Fourth Palace, whose capital is Tlar.  Much of the land administered by the Fourth Palace is harsh desert scrubland unsuitable for farming, but the logging industry near the border with Mmorcha is most lucrative.  The Army of the West of the modern era has had little experience with human foes, mostly stationed across the frontier to ward off the bestial Churstalli.

Unlike their counterparts, the Mu’ugalavyani are meticulous urban planners, preferring to build their cities upward instead of outward.  Where most cities expand organically, haphazardly building wherever there’s room to grow, Mu’ugalavyani cities are built on a grid, with easy to navigate avenues instead of the maddened tangle of alleys found elsewhere in the Five Empires.  Commoners and nobility alike live in towering edifices up to five storeys tall, though of course, class divisions make for quite different living conditions.  Mu’ugalavyani slums are tall tenements, with entire families dwelling in small cramped rooms and the whole building relying on a common bath.  The ruling class dwell in more comfortable accommodations, with heavy masonry, brightly colored tile mosaics and geometrical gardens.

Outside of the cities, the commoners of Mu’ugalavyá dwell in simple brick houses with thatched or tiled roofs, scarcely more than a few rooms big.  Wealthier Mu’ugalavyani live much the same, but in multi-storeyed dwellings with a central courtyard surrounded by private apartments.  These domiciles often possess separate wings for housing and entertaining guests, with wood pillared porches and modest gardens.  The Mu’ugalavyani differ from their contemporaries in that they do not build fortifications around their settlements, trusting instead their military might to repel invaders.

Like their neighbors to the south, the Mu’ugalavani utilize the calendar of the ancient priest-king Kazhilo’ob, by which the current year is 10,039 A.K.

#### *Current Events*

The Princes of Mu’ugalava are watching the conflict between Tsolyanu and Yan Kor closely, they are eager to reclaim the Chakas while the imperium is distracted by the northmen.  Pressures from N’luss in the north and Livyanu in the south prohibit any designs for fighting upon a third front.  For the time being, the Four Palaces play both sides, Yan Kor lacks the manpower to permanently occupy the south, but a unified Tsolyanu stretching from the northern sea to the south is intolerable.  While the empire may seem natural friends with Yan Kor, the occupation of the small nation of Pijena leaves them right on Mu’ugalavya’s doorstep, furthermore any alliance would be tenuous as Baron Ald had made his distrust of the Four Palaces widely known.  This has not stopped renegade citizens weary of the bureaucratic nightmare of the empire from making the long journey northeast in search of coin and adventure.  The most glaring example being a general raiding the armory and treasury of Pagus before escaping to Yan Kor to fight in the Baron’s armies. 

##### Mu’ugalavyani Cities

	**Kheris:** a maritime city of docks and ships, but with an ancient history of important libraries and temple complexes

	**Pagus:** a Chakan-style town

	**Neihai:** deeply forested, more Livyani than Mu’ugalavyani

	**Ch’ochi:** a half-ruined city, mired in its past glories The atmosphere of Ch’ochi is highly magical, moreso in the city’s Underworld, where even a child may summon sparks of powers with but the snap of the fingers.  The city’s underworld is stupefyingly deep, rumored to reach the verst centre of the world.

The Citadel of Ebon Light, where the brave Pendarte of Kheris did battle with the minions of She Who Cannot Be Named

	**Gashchne:** A lonely frontier town near the Great Desert of Galai, often called the “City at the Edge of Nothingness”, for it being the only sign of civilization amidst the desolation.  The nobility of Gashchne worship a unique local incarnation of the god of undeath, called Guru’umish, who is said to dwell within a temple hidden in the Plain of Towers.

#### *Ssa’atis*

Ssa’atis is a very neat and orderly city, even moreso than the typical Mu’ugalavyani metropolis.  Distinguished by its tiers of painted columns, vast murals of multi-colored tiles and red-tiled roofs.

The Princes of the Four Palaces each take part in keeping the peace within the city, maintaining separate legions to patrol for criminal activity and to counter the ambitions of the other Princes.  In effect, Ssa’atis possess four separate police forces, each under orders to spy on the others and root out threats to the regime.  These troops are named for various shades of red; the First Palace controls the Crimson Legion, the Second Palace controls the Scarlet Brigade, the Third Palace controls the Vermillion Regiment and the Fourth Palace controls the Maroon Company.  The Temple of Hrsh provides a fifth and stabilizing element to city peacekeeping by way of the militant sect known as the Mourners in Sable; no executions may be held without their express sanction.

The Mu’ugalavyani have a strong prediliction for grouping practitioners of various professions together into specific districts, thus every city has a textiles districts, jewlers districts, prostitution districts, and so on.  Mu’ugalavani cities will often have an “assassin’s row”, a designated thoroughfare leading out of the city that assassins clans reside upon in order to conduct themselves surreptitiously.

The Mu’ugalavyani take great pride in their running water, the city of Ssa’tis and many others are provided with fresh water from certain waterways that are kept to a standard of cleanliness codified by Palatial law.  Other streams are allowed to be polluted, with unfortunate results for those dwelling downstream.  Ssa’tis itself takes its water supply from a reservoir fed by several such waterways, with great bronze pumps that feed the water into city aqueducts. 

#### *Mu’ugalla* 

*“The universe continues until the last leaf of the Tree of Time shrivels and drops from its branch.”* **\-Third ode of Bi'isumish, the Blind Poet of Ssa'átis** 

and Lord Hrsh

The Éngsvanyáli pantheon have their counterparts in Mu’ugalavyá, but the state religion worships the four-armed, beast-headed Hŕsh as the supreme godhead of the cosmos.

#### *The Great Desert of Galai* 

The desert is a deathtrap, home to the Chürstálli, a cunning beast similar to the Hluss, but more at home in the sands than the seas.  The source of respite from the fiends is the Churu Peak, but those expecting safety will be sorely mistaken, the solitary mountain is home to the Dwellers on the Mount

#### *The Plain of Towers*

Far beyond the northwestern borders of Mu’ugalavya and the Great Desert of Galai lies a monument of the Great Ancients known as the Plain of Towers.  The region is strewn with strange towers of imperishable metal, resistant to everything save for the mightiest sorceries.  Mixed among these metallic towers are those made of stone, built in imitation by the scattered tribes of humans that dwell there; people similar in stature to the N’luss, but nowhere as senselessly belligerent.  The construction of the stone towers is a multi-generational effort, equal to any public works project of the Five Empires, done in the hopes of luring the so-called “Lords of the Skies” back to Tekumel.

#### *Puru ab Sharar*

Within the southern delta of the Putuhenu River lies the twin homelands of the Hegléthyal, the swamps of Puru ab Sharar.

	Puru.

### ***Salarvyá***

*“The only thing the Salarvyáni can organize is disorganization.”* **\-Tsolyáni proverb**

The great seafaring trade empire of the east, nominally ruled by a mad king, but administered by an intricate web of feudal overlords and their vassals.

The common Salarvyani dwell in modest domed huts of mud-brick or adobe, surrounded by high walls of prickly shrubs for defense.  Larger domiciles are built from stone, with a U-shaped outer courtyard, adjoined to dining chambers and private family quarters in the back.  A well or fountain is commonly found in the center of the courtyard, surrounded by gardens and high stone walls.  The largest dwellings employed by the Salarvyani are massive, frowning palace-fortresses held up by low, solid columns and have notably high ceilings to keep out the heat.  

The Salarvyani employ a variation of the calendar of Kazhilo’ob, but reckoning the Time of No Kings was three thousand years longer, thus the current year is 13,289 E.T, for the Era of Tsatayagga.

The same calendar is consulted for horoscopes when a new child is born, in the noble families this is paired with the genealogy of the parents and their place in the line of succession is decided. Much like other southern cultures, the birth of a boy is met with great celebration, but more often it is the girl-child who is treated better than her brothers.

*“In Salarvyá, it is the birthright of every noble maiden to be spoiled rotten.”* **\- Firu Ba Yeker, imperial scholar and priest of Sarku**

##### Salarvyani Cities

	**Koyluga:** A great metropolis amid the western plains, every building crowned with writhing friezes of heroes and mythological beasts. Looming over all the populace are the frowning citadels of their feudal masters, the Thirreqúmmu family.  The Den of Profitable Joy once called this city home, but the Thirreqúmmu scattered the clan abroad to serve as their eyes and ears in other lands.

	**Chame’el:** A teeming port city on the southwestern coast, even the lesser clans of the city can pridefully adorn their homes with myriad demon faces carven of agate and chrysoberyl.  For a city with such a large population of Ahoggya, this may seem a mockery, but even they enjoy the custom.

	**Naggás:** A typical coastal city near the Chaidara Protectorate, built of buff sandstone and red porphyry, its outer walls are engraved with spells and warnings against invaders.  Tall black obelisks erected upon the shoreline provide another line of magical defence against pirates.  The ruling Hruchchittlantyal family dwells within the Palace of the Four Faces, each side carved with a massive frowning visage.  The founding legend of the city claims that the palace is all that remains of four brother wizards, who summoned a demon to build the port city, but cheated the creature of its payment. 

	**Fort Ormichash:** A fortified coastal city of eastern Salarvya, completely enclosed by stout walls with a single canal leading into the harbor district, guarded by fearsome idols of the goddess Shiringgayi.  The city’s foundation dates back to the Engsvanyali era, when a priest-king had a seaside ridge levelled to build a pleasure palace far away from the commotion of the inner empire.  Known today as the Hexagonal Hall of Ancient Banners and still used by the ruling elite, the palace is a dazzling display of opulence with mosaics of gold and rare jewels.  The windows are thin slabs of alabaster, excruciatingly carved into lace-like arabesques. Fort Ormichash has resisted every attempt to raid the city’s wealth, but that has not tempered the ambitions of pirates.

	

	**Elelun:** A peaceful city of scholars in eastern Salarvya, noted for its beautiful, if overly detailed stained glass windows displaying great tableaus.  The political conflicts of the Five Empires are only of interest to the historians dwelling there, but ultimately have little impact on daily life.  More concern is held for whether ships seen on the horizon are merchants or pirates.

#### *The Council of Nobles*

Ostensibly, the Salarvyani adhere to the divine right of kings, each of the seven noble lineages claiming heredity from the Gamulu Dynasty from the ancient royalty of the Fisherman Kings. However, the power held by the *Chgeshsha* (“King”) is actually quite limited, the true power behind the Ebon Throne being the Council of Nobles.  For the past two hundred years, senior members of Chruggilleshmu dynasty have held the most prominent positions within the Council, with other delegates from the other six major lineages; the Temple of Shiringgayi, minor noble lineages and some important vassal clans having their own representatives.

Unlike the other empires, the power structure of Salarvya is less centralized, instead divided among the seven ruling lineages.  These feudal dynasties own almost all of the arable land in the nation, the remainder held by a scattering of minor noble families.  The administration of these domains is parcelled out by a complex system of vassalage, with greater families leasing portions of their fiefs to lesser families and so on, along increasingly lower social ranks.  In addition to their fiefdoms, each of the major noble lineages holds a monopoly over certain trades and goods within the nation.

**Chrugilleshmu:** Centered on Tsatsayágga, the Chrugilleshmu family control all shipping done along the southern coasts, they own the boats, the harbors and everything else save for the seas. 

**Gürrüshyúgga:** Centered on Tsa'avtúlgu, the Gürrüshyúgga family controls the trade of grain, wines, rare woods and spices of the eastern central regions.

**Hrüchcháqsha:**  Centered on Cham'él, the Hrüchcháqsha family hold sway over the dye trade, especially the harvesting of *Vrelq*, an ink produced by a crustacean of the same name, which is used to make a rich black dye favored by the elite families and the Salarvyani army.

**Khekhkhéssa:**  Centered on Héru, wealth of the the Khekhkhéssa family is made in natural resources, harvesting timber and other forestry products, as well as the mining of metals, controlling one of the few sources of iron, the ancient pits of Tamkade Bay.

**Mreshshél-Átl:** Centered around Lake Mrissútl, the resources held by the Mreshshél-Átl family are spiritual in nature.  The Inner Shrine of the Goddess Shiringgayi rests upon its shores, the Mreshshél-Átl family being stalwart patrons of the priestesses that dwell there.

**Shiggashko'ónmu:** Centered on Jækánta, the Shiggashko'ónmu family deals in gems, pearls, and silky *Gudru* cloth.  The Shiggashko'ónmu dynasty is vast, containing over 40 sub-lineages, each 

**Thirreqúmmu:** Centered on Koylúga, the Thirreqúmmu family holds the reins on grain and produce and the transport of both within the western provinces.

#### *The Mad King of Salarvya*

The great king Gamulu of ancient Salarvya, who fought proudly against Enemies of Man during the Ssu Wars, died most ignobly of a wasting disease.  It is for this reason, codified in ancient law, the ruler of Salarvya is permitted to serve only so long as they remain healthy.  If the king of Salarvya were to suffer any life-threatening injury or illness, it is the sacred duty of the Council of Nobles to depose him and sacrifice their former monarch to Shiringgayi, death by impalement being the traditional means.

Fortunately for King Griggatsetsa, he is quite healthy; unfortunately for Salarvya, he is also quite mad.  The Council of Nobles has no legal means to proceed with his deposement formally, as madness is not considered an acceptable ailment for removal.  Griggatsetsa is harmless enough, content to be paraded about the palace gardens in a palanquin lifted by children.  The political factions within the Hall of Cascading Waters post guards and set magical wards to protect King Griggatsetsa from any fallout from their machinations.

The Chrugilleshmu family has delegated the duties of rulership to Prince Zhurrilugga, a canny and unscrupulous political operative.  He governs much like a puppet-master upon the stage and has sown many enemies among the Council of Nobles.  Of the major families, only Hrüchcháqsha, Khekhkhéssa and Mreshshél-Átl support Prince Zhurrilugga, while the Thirreqúmmu and Gürrüshyúgga support his chief rival Prince Tleggirshmu, the Shiggashko'ónmu family remains uncommitted.


##### Tsatsayagga

The Hall of Cascading Waters, the great chambers of the Ebon Throne 

A forest of high domes and gilded cupolas beside the sea

The Salarvyani are not known for the cleanliness of their cities, they employ much of the same methods for keeping their water supplies clean, but they are not practiced with the same degree of rigor.  Visitors to Tsatayagga often remark upon the almost palpable miasma of urban life that assaults the senses. 

The ancient rivalry between the Koyluga and Chame’el families has come to a head, 

#### *Current Events*

The Salarvyani have much to gain from a Tsolyani defeat, reclaiming the lost protectorates of Kaija, Kerunan, and Chaigari.  The feudal lords are much too distant to provide more assistance than gold and Ahoggya mercenaries marching through the craggy mountains of Kilalammu.

Salarvya is currently dealing with a Khomórg problem and attempting to exterminate it.  A Khomórg is a small, six-legged crustacean, about a hand span in length, that crawls ashore in droves to raid storehouses and marketplaces for fruit, for which it possesses a great appetite.  It is bright blue-green in color and considered sacred to Shiringgáyi.  

But Khomórg is also the name of a populist religious movement, with the goal of overthrowing the feudal order in favor of theocracy ruled by the priestesses of Shiringgáyi.  It’s membership is drawn from the *shadad* (“serfs”) and other downtrodden Salarvyani, several minor noble households have been found butchered by their servants, who consumed their flesh in ritual cannibalism. 

##### Eastern Salarvya

Hugging the southeastern coast of the continent, Salarvya covers a vast expanse of territory, in the densely populated west, it engages in the intrigues of the Five Empires, but towards the east, these concerns are literally on the other side of the world.  The eastern Salarvyani have more interactions with the Nom and Onmu tle Hlektis than with any of the Engsvanyalu-descended nations. 

Eastern Salarvya is culturally and ethnically distinct from its western half, life moves slower and is generally more peaceful, the most pressing things to worry about are pirate raids and other things that blow in from the sea.


##### Lake Mrissútl

The cult of Shiringgayi keeps their largest and grandest shrine on the shores of this most holy lake, the place where the viridian goddess first revealed Herself to the Salarvyani.  The Temple  of Shiringgayi is practically a large town, home not only to the priestesses, but also their servants and all of their families.  The temple complex encloses the Inner Shrine of the Goddess Shiringgayi, accessible only by upper echelons of the cult. The lands surrounding Lake Mrissutl are the fiefdom of the Mreshshél-Átl family, who lease the temple grounds to the priesthood for a princely sum of a single grain of rice paid yearly.

The temple complex is protected by the Trampling Horde, an Ahoggyá legion in the service of the cult of Shiringgáyi. Their effectiveness at keeping the peace is debatable, given the typical loutish behavior of the Ahoggya, but they are utterly loyal to the priestesses, who treat them almost as pets.  It is not uncommon to see a priestess followed about by an Ahoggya legionnaire, doting upon the oaf as one would a kitten.

##### Chadara Protectorate

Once a minor state ruled by the Ruthoshshikh family, but conquered by the Ebon Throne and made a protectorate of Salarvya.  The Chruggílléshmu quickly installed a friendly regime, their longtime vassals the Hwa'altikonesh family.

The protectorate is the centre of the Arikkái movement in Eastern Salarvyá for independence from the Lords of Tsatsayágga and the gods of Pavár.

##### Sharuna Lowlands

The Ahoggyá of the Sharúna Lowlands are in a constant state of low, simmering rebellion, every few years a demagogue manages to rouse the slovenly brutes into a furor and steal one or two merchantman ships.   These Ahoggya pirates sail up and down the coasts targeting human villages; in the aftermath of each bloody raid, bodies are often found piled around a cooking pit.  The relative infrequency of these uprisings hasn’t given the Ebon Throne much cause for concern

The swamp villages of the lowlands are the oldest Ahoggya settlements of the north, having been settled by colonists from Haida Pakala during the Time of No Kings.

### ***Tsolyánu***

*"Do as you will in Tsolyanu, but do not die there\!"* **\-Salarvyani proverb**

The Empire of the Petal Throne, heirs apparent to the Second Imperium.  Ruled by their God-Emperor, they are powerful, rich and confident in their supremacy

At present, the Tsolyani calendar reckons the date as 2358 A.S. or After Seal, referring to the ascension of the first God-Emperor, bearer of the Seal of the Imperium.

Tsolyani clans dwell in rambling mud-brick clanhouses, typically with an enclosed outer court that leads to a reception hall, guest rooms are kept to the side while the living quarters are in the back, where the communal kitchens and baths are also kept.  Wealthier clans live in more complex clanhouses, with separate apartments for various lineages, specialized workshops and sales rooms.   All clanhouses are surrounded by high walls with light fortifications, but defenses tend to be lower in provinces closer to the heart of the empire.

Tsolyani clans are quick to register the births of new children with the Palace of the Realm; many mothers have elected to give birth at the great bureaucracy in order to settle other legal affairs while possessing a functionary’s presence.  Typically with southern nations, the birth of a boy-child is cause for feasting, the giving of gifts and lavish parties, though no more costly than what the family’s clan can afford.  Of course, the birth of a girl-child is also cause for celebration, but the occasions tend to be more modest in scope.  Class also has a part to play, even the  birth of a noble heiress will be leagues more extravagant than that of a middle-ranking clan’s festivities for a boy.

Modern Tsolyanu encompasses the heartlands of what was Engsvanyalu, the island of Ganga itself lies half-submerged off the southern coast.


#### *Imperial Protectorates*

The empires of Tsolyanu, Mu’ugalavya and Salarvya have annexed several small nations to serve as buffer states between them and their rivals.  These Protectorates have changed hands several times across the millennia and often display a melange of cultural elements from their conquerors and the local populations.

Chaigári Protectorate

*“A Chaigári herdsman is a bandit who has stolen many animals.”* **\-Tsolyáni proverb**

Kaijá Protectorate

Kerunán Protectorate

Do Chaka

To the southwest is Do Chaka

The *Daichu* trees of the Chakas make the best rope and cable in the Five Empires, the bark of the tree can be pounded into thin durable cloth preferred by the workwomen of Tsolyanu and Mu’ugalavya.

Ngeshtu Head

The Forest of Hh-kk-ssa is a sacred grove located somewhere in Do Chaka, the forest kept secret from outsiders and is believed to be ensorcelled to prevent overly curious explorers from stumbling upon it.  The Pe Choi calendar counts the passage of time from their mythical emergence from the sacred forest; it is now the year 75,690 of this epoch.

Pan Chaka

To the west lies Pan Chaka, the soaring *Ezbal* tree forests of the Chakas serves as a natural barrier between the imperium and their greatest rival Mu’ugalvya.  The jungles have been traded back and forth by the two empires for centuries, much to the chagrin of their nonhuman Pachi Lei and Pe Choi inhabitants.

Hríka: Secret city of the Pé Chói from before the “Time of Darkness” served by tube ways 17 & 18\. All the above ground structures were raised, and there are powerful guardians protecting the valuable areas.

##### Tsolyani Cities

	**Tumissa:** The red sandstone palaces of Tumissa surround a volcanic crater lake on the western edge of the Imperium.  Its mighty High Fortress stands defiant upon its western shores against Mu’ugalavani encroachment, as impregnable as was when first built centuries ago.  The clan of the Red Sword rules here, the Imperial governor personally serving as the general of the Legion of the Citadel of Glory.

	**Khirgar:** The bastion of the northwest, Khirgar is a hilltop city built within three concentric rings.  The outer ring holds the residential districts, foreigner’s quarter, marketplaces and slums, while the aristocracy is practically piled on top of one another in multi-storied mansions within the second ring, all surrounding a walled enclosure containing the temples of the gods, palaces of the ruling noble clans and the Citadel of the Governor of the North.

	**Purdimal:** Huddled in the foetid swamps of the Great Morass, beneath the shadow of Thenu Thendraya Peak, the “Black Toad of the Empire '' earns its name in more ways than one.  The city is a tangled maze built from pockmarked volcanic stone, afflicted by an all-pervading malaise of something secretive, alien and brooding.

	**Paya Gupa:** An excellent example of a typical city of the Chakas, with quaint, tile-roofed houses made of tan wood and white limestone.  Humans, Pe Choi and Pachi Lei inhabitants mingling peacefully under the shadow of gargantuan *Ezbal* trees and smoky blue mountains.  Such placidity is deceptive, for these are the ancestral feifs of clan Ito, the so-called “Lich Lords” of the Chakas and unspeakable things prowl these dark forests.

	**Mrelu:** One of the bustling cities of the central plains, the breadbasket of Tsolyanu.  Far from an impoverished hamlet, these cities are thriving economic nexuses where powerful agricultural and merchant clans do trade.  The people are much like their architecture, flat, neat, solid and a little pompous.

**Penom:**  A large fishing village on the southern coast, Penom is prosperous, but highly unpleasant to live in.   The sea air is like the hot breath of a drunkard, the walls splotched with mold and everything is somehow damp.   Penom is more often a place where people travel away from rather than journey to, as visitors complain of smelling like fish for a week after a mere overnight stay.  

**Sarku:**  The cultural and religious stronghold of its eponymous deity, the City of Sarku sits upon five hilltops, with numerous towers reaching skyward on each.  The entire city and its people have the character of a tomb: being quiet, gloomy and morbid.  Though its inhabitants take pride in having resisted the zeal of the 24th God-Empress Shaira Su, “the Divine Daughter of Thumis”, during her persecutions of devotees to Change.

**Thri’il:** Standing proud between two mountains, “the Pendant Between Avanthe’s Breasts”, as it is called, guards the northern pass to the Imperium.  So-named for the little city’s jewel-like coloration, every building is painted in a different pastel hue, including it’s mighty battlements.

**Fasiltum:** A mirage of red sandstone, white marble and black diorite rising from the Desert of Eyagi in the northeast, the “City of Chiming Skulls” is heard long before it is seen. Desert winds stirring the heads of decapitated felons along with bells of glass and brass, strung together by silver chains hanging from the city walls.  The ancestral home of the noble Vriddi clan, source of many of the imperium’s woes as well as its greatest heroes, who regularly contrive some reason to rebel against the Petal Throne almost every other generation. 

**Sokatis:**  Located in the southeast, Sokatis is known as the “Roofed City'' for its numerous arcades and porticos, a welcome comfort for this sun-drenched region.  The ancient priest-kings of Ganga bade it necessary that all castes be able traverse the city in any direction without having to step into the sunlight.  Every tier of society can traverse the city sheltered beneath their own ornate colonnades.  Sokatis’s intricate bas-relief murals and abundant grotesques are culturally more to Salarvyani tastes, having been won with the conquest of the Kerunán Protectorate.  The city and its surrounding countryside is home to several communities of the reptilian Shen, their ancestors fleeing oppression in Shenyu and were granted asylum by the God-Emperor Heshtu’atl “the Mighty”, in return, they would provide the Imperium with a legion in perpetuity.  Since then, the Horde of Hrk-ss, the Eater of Eggs serves to protect Sokatis and to counter Salarvyani encroachment of Kerunán.

**Jaikalor:**  A flat, faceless town of shops with only the clacking of cloth-looms and the scent of fresh cut wood from the Forest of Gilraya to liven the atmosphere.  If it weren’t for the massive presence of troops and defenses, one could confuse Jaikalor for any number of settlements in the region.  The humble people of the Kaijá Protectorate are constantly under threat of either annexation from Salarvya or from the genocidal raids of the Hlutrgu from Mssuntl Bay.

#### *Jakalla \- the City Half as Old as the World*

*“In Jakálla, you can buy anything... or anybody.”* **\-Fíru Bá Yéker, imperial scribe and priest of Sarku**

Ancient Jakalla, Mistress of the Mssuma River, lounges decadently upon the tidal flats of southern Tsolyanu.  Jakalla has been a prominent city since the days of antiquity; being one of the founding cities of the Great States of the Triangle, and over the long centuries growing to become one of the jewels of the south.  The cruel and noble Bednalljan Dynasty briefly moved their powerbase to Jakalla after they abandoned their old capital, needing a city unburdened by shameful memories and vengeful ghosts.  

Though Bey Su has eclipsed Jakalla in national prominence, the city is still a centre of culture, economics and politics in Tsolyanu, holding the distinction of being the capital of two imperial provinces.  

Divided by the Mssuma River, Jakalla is actually three cities in one, of course, there is Jakalla proper, but also the harbor towns of Pala Jakalla and Musa Jakalla.  Pala Jakalla is the naval base of Tsolyani military, while Musa Jakalla is the civilian harbor, each were once separate settlements, but over time, they grew outward and their borders mingled together.

The Tsolyani take great pride in the cleanliness of their cities, even a den of iniquity like Jakalla can be counted upon to have clean running water.  Armies of slaves man the bucket-chains that draw fresh water into the city’s aqueducts and dire penalties await any official that fails to keep valued waterways to Imperium standards.  Most other streams are used for disposal of waste, to the detriment of those settlements downstream.	

#### *Bey Su \- the Soul of the World*

*“In Béy Sǘ, secrets are like water in a cracked jug.”* **\-Fíru Bá Yéker, imperial scribe and priest of Sarku** 

The new capital, the city of cities, Bey Su, meaning “Soul of the World'' in the dead tongue of the Bednalljans, a marvel of its age and remaining so for the millenia to come.  A city of dreams and splendors built with the plunder of a thousand lands and a thousand years; jeweled pavilions overlooking broad avenues, palaces with golden domes that seem to touch the sky, and tiered gardens filled with exotic beasts and perfumed flowers.

Perhaps the largest metropolis in the Five Empires, Bey Su sits astride the lazy, dun-hued waters of the Mssuma River. On the western bank, a bustling hive of commerce, governance and faith, where all the Imperium meets and draws itself into the future.  On the eastern bank lie the muted avenues of the City of the Dead, aside from the workcamps of laborers building new tombs, only living inhabitants of this necropolis are the prisoners of the infamous Tolek Kana Pits, some of which have dwelt within the dungeon for generations, entire families punished for crimes committed by ancestors long dead.

##### Avanthar

*“One may well wonder who envies the most: the lesser folk who gaze curiously up at the blank walls and upturned gables of the Emperor's residence, or the Emperor himself, in all his lonely glory, as he looks down upon the colourful, chattering throngs in the gardens upon the summit of his citadel.”* **\-Fíru Bá Yéker, imperial scribe and priest of Sarku**

The fortress-palace of Avanthar is almost a small city in itself, hewn from a crag of dark sandstone at the confluence of two river valleys in the northern mountains.  All visitors must enter Avanthar at the only official entrance, ferried across the river to a dock chamber carved into the western promontory, where they are promptly greeted by the Omnipotent Azure Legion.  Approaching the home of the God-Emperor unbidden is extremely unwise, so one best to have their imperial summons or other such documentation ready for inspection.

The lower levels contain a labyrinth of halls connecting to various departments of the imperial bureaucracy, teeming with all manner of scribes, servants and other functionaries.  In addition to the various chambers of governance, these passages contain every amenity available to a typical city, including armories, workshops, shrines, dormitories and dining halls.  It is possible to live cradle to grave without ever having to leave the administrative levels of Avanthar, as the tombs of great historical majordomos can attest.  Every day, throngs of litigants and supplicants pour in from every corner of Tsolyanu, mediating these disputes and pleas is the sacred duty of these bureaucrats, whose thankless toil keeps the Imperium fed, paid, and protected.  

The middle tiers of Avanthar are the private lodgings of various degrees of officials, as well as public halls and other sorts of civic facilities one finds in a living city.  The uppermost tiers of the fortress-palace houses the temples, the apartments of prominent courtiers, and suites of imperial heirs, in addition to the great library with its academy of scholars, numerous council rooms and private audience chambers.  At the very pinnacle of the Imperium, lies the blue-veined marble ziggurat of the Hall of Supernal Radiance, where the great and powerful aristocratic clans of the imperium hold court.  Outside of these stuffy, incense-soaked chambers, the nobility enjoys magnificent hanging gardens overlooking breathtaking mountainside vistas, all under the shadow of the Golden Tower, where dwells the mighty and glorious God-Emperor.  The legions of courtiers, human and alien alike, mingle together in a circus of voluminous costumes, beguiling perfumes, sumptuous morsels, babbling languages and a thousand other delights.  

Upon passing through the Gates of Sublime Visitation, and once more into the Hall of Supernal Radiance. all becomes hushed and reverent.  The Hall of Supernal Radiance is essentially the temple to the imperium; at all hours of the day, choirs of priests sing hymns exulting the glories of past God-Emperors.  When one tires, a replacement is signalled and steps into place, never breaking the harmony.

The crags surrounding Avanthar are home to a small but influential community of Hlaka, whose ancestors were invited to roost in nearby caverns by the God-Emperor Metlunel V “the Esthete”.  The Hlaka found a kindred spirit with this flighty emperor and served as his trusted eyes and ears across the imperium, a role they would gleefully resume should they find the occupant of the Petal Throne agreeable.  The God-Empress Nrainue “the Iridescent Goddess” was one who possessed the favor of Avanthar’s Hlaka, who would bear her aloft in a flying palanquin, hundreds of wings darkening the skies above the city.

*Somewhere in Avanthar’s deepest chambers lies a massive vault of Great Ancients, legendarily having resisted the wills of glorious and powerful emperors since time immemorial.  If it’s location isn’t an imperial secret held by the Omnipotent Azure Legion, then it isn't known at all.*  

#### *Palaces of the Imperium*

All power in the Imperium flows from the God-Emperor, but it is the sacred duty of four great bureaus to carry out imperial will.  Each Palace is an expansive hierarchy organized into several “Circles” of rank, all reports and requests are circulated to the relevant authority within a given region or passed higher up the chain of command.  The offices of these great bureaucracies are near-constantly abuzz with activity; petitioners arguing their cases with clerks, vendors hawking refreshing *chumetl* or other treats to those waiting in line, scribes writing missives for the illiterate and certain functionaries selling the favors of their important friends.

The first four Circles comprise the army of scribes, clerks and other petty functionaries that handle the menial tasks of the office.  The Fifth through Eighth Circles encompass their supervisors, managers and other middle-ranked clerks. The Ninth through Twelfth Circles form local department heads, fief-administrators and the personal aides of higher ranking officials.  The Thirteenth through Fifteenth Circles are made up of District Palace Chiefs, mayors of large cities and members of the governor’s court.  The members of the Sixteenth to Eighteenth Circles are the Provincial Palace heads and their senior advisors, as well as gubernatorial legates.  The Nineteenth to Twenty-First Circles are among the upper echelons of society, including governors, high functionaries at Avanthar and members of the Court of Purple Robes, personal advisors to the God-Emperor.  

Any higher ranks can only be held by individuals in close esteem to the Petal Throne itself, the identities of which are kept concealed by the Omnipotent Azure Legion.  There is one exception, whose duties preclude such secrecy, the Provost of the High Chancery and Prefect of the Servitors of the Exalted.  This position is of the Twenty-Fifth Circle and is the highest possible rank, second only to the God-Emperor in power.

**The Palace of the Realm:** The living body of the Imperium, this Palace governs the domestic affairs of Tsolyanu.  This is the bureau most citizens will have contact with on a regular basis, as it collects taxes, manages trade and operates the judicial system.  Public works such as the Sakbe roads, necropoli and urban renewal fall also under the purview of the Palace of the Realm.  Every town with a population greater than 5000 possesses an office of this monolithic bureaucracy.

**The Palace of Ever-Glorious War:** The military wing of the Imperium, this Palace governs everything related to warfare and the armies.  With offices in every major city, this department manages recruitment, training, and deployment of personnel, as well as maintaining supply lines, defensive fortifications and other matters of strategic importance.

**The Palace of the Priesthood of the Gods:**  The spiritual wing of the Imperium, found in all large cities, but has branches in smaller towns of religious importance.  This Palace governs liaisons with the Temples of Change and Stability, collecting taxes from temple lands, mediating disputes between sects and organizing ceremonies for public holidays. 

**The Palace of Foregn Lands:**  The diplomatic arm of the Imperium, this Palace governs relations with other nations, this includes embassies, but also foreign trade and customs.  The offices of Palace of Foreign Lands are most commonly found on border towns, but also in the twin hearts of the Imperium, Bey Su and Avanthar.

#### *The Three Treasures of the Tlakotani*

**The Seal of the Imperium.**  A deceptively simple artifact, the Seal of the Imperium can engrave an intricate, whorling insignia on any known material.  This image is impossible to replicate, its endless spirals always twisting into new positions when not observed and is palpably otherworldly to gaze upon.  Many cities opened their gates to the first God-Emperor after receiving a missive emblazoned with such a seal. It is kept within the Golden Tower, never far from the reach of the imperial presence.

**The Jade Arch.** The loyalty of those closest to the God-Emperor is ensured by means of the Jade Arch.  A device of the Great Ancients resembling a truncated pyramid made of dark green stone with a short corridor running through its base.  Any person who passes through the corridor is made utterly loyal to whomever sits upon the Petal Throne, retaining all of their faculties and prior attitudes regarding the occupant, but rendered psychically incapable of betraying the imperium.  The technology behind the Jade Arch is poorly understood and its properties are reserved primarily for the Servitors of Silence, the small army of deaf-mutes that serve as the God-Emperor’s personal guards and retainers.  Any nobles of high rank and other imperial officials summoned for an audience must pass beneath the Jade Arch before entering the Hall of Supernal Radiance.

**The Petal Throne.** The very namesake of the Imperium, the Petal Throne is a seat carved from a single piece of gray-green stone, fashioned in the image of a great flower.  Concealed by translucent screens of gray-green jade with ornate carved flowers, set into the wall at the far end of the Hall of Supernal Radiance, accessible only through the adjoining chambers of the Golden Tower.  When conducting affairs of court, the God-Emperor lights a simple candle behind the screen to announce the imperial presence to prostrate nobility.

#### *The Stone Upon Which the Universe Rests*

The 61st God-Emperor is Hirkane Tlakotani and as his title suggests, his rule has been like a steady drum upon a slave galley, smooth, orderly and prosperous.  Rising to prominence in his grandfather’s legions, Hirkane became an almost legendary figure back in the early campaigns with Yan Kor.  After his father’s brief rule, no challengers came forth during the *Kolumejalim* ceremony as few were willing to contest a war hero's claim to the Petal Throne.  Though he is elderly, he is far from infirm and his mind sharper than it was in youth, ever aware of human frailty.  Hirkane has taken a keen interest in his succession and has sown many heirs, having the Omnipotent Azure Legion place them into the care of patrons across the empire and possibly those beyond.

#### *Heirs and Spares*

*“The promises of princes are written upon the surface of a stream.”* **\-Fíru Bá Yéker, imperial scribe and priest of Sarku** 

Typically if an emperor or empress has any children prior to ascension, they automatically become princes and princesses of the realm once their parent enters the Golden Tower.  Afterward, those sired with imperial concubines are given into the care of high-ranking clans at birth as is traditional for children of imperial personages.  The political ambitions of the foster-clans typically dictate when imperial heirs are revealed to the Chancery of Avanthar, though the Omnipotent Azure Legion knows where each dwells. The unveiling of an heir is guaranteed to stir up a whirlwind as the key players of imperial society race to reposition themselves and much like a game of *Den-den,* take stock of the new piece upon the board.  Newly-minted princelings are raced to Avanthar to be “given the Gold”, being officially verified as a rightful heir by the Omnipotent Azure Legion and receiving all the perquisites of sovereign rank. The current God-Emperor has seven known heirs, though doubtlessly there are many more awaiting the Gold.

	**Rereshqala.** The God-Emperor’s eldest son, raised among the ancient aristocrats of the Clan of Sea Blue.  The Royalist Party would see him raised to the Petal Throne, but he seems more interested in patronage of the arts and opulent diversions at his private coastal villa near Jakalla.  Rereshqala is considered an urbane and cultured figure in aristocratic society, well-liked but not particularly impressive.

	**Eselne.**  The second of the emperor’s children was adopted by the Temple of Karakan, who raised the boy into a great soldier.  Eselne is almost an ideal candidate by the Military Party’s standards; forthright, decisive and of course, strong as a *Chlen*\-beast.  However, he is lacking in manners, nor particularly clever and ill-suited at diplomacy, earning him the nickname “the Two-Legged Ahoggya.”

	**Surundano.** The third scion was given to the Temple of Thumis and trained to become a scholar-priest, but he is more accustomed to dusty libraries than the jeweled courts of society.  Surudano was revealed earlier than what is traditionally done and is supported by the Gentle Deities, a faction of the Priestly Party composed of the Temples of Hnalla, Avanthe and Belkanu.

	**Mridobu.** The emperor’s forth child was entrusted to the Provost of the High Chancery and has lived amongst the exalted courts of Avanthar all his life.  Mridobu is much like a gemstone, smooth, polished and pleasing to the eye, yet also cold and hard.  He is a skilled diplomat and knows his way around court, but lacks experience outside the intrigues of high society.

	**Mirusiya.** The fifth imperial heir was placed within the Vriddi clan, the ancient lords of the city of Fasiltum.  Mirusiya served in the Legion of the Lord of Red Devastation, rising to the rank of *Dritlan* before he was revealed, splitting the interests of the Military Party.  He is cannier than he appears and knows more about how the average Tsolyani lives than the other heirs.  But the Vriddi clan is notorious for its quarrelling and he may have inherited their grudgeries.

	**Dhich’une.** The sixth and youngest son of the God-Emperor was raised by the Temple of Sarku and is a fanatical devotee to the Lord of Worms.  His ascension is supported by the Dark Trinity, a faction of the Priestly Party composed of the Temples of Hru’u, Ksarul and Sarku.  Dhich’une has few supporters outside of this faction and inspires dread in most others, shoring up the deficiencies in his power base by sorcerous means, including legions of undead warriors.

	**Ma’in.** The youngest heir and only revealed daughter of the emperor was given to the Temple of Avanthe, but caused something of a scandal with her sudden conversion to the worship of Dlamelish.  Ma’in is known in courtly circles as “the Exquisite” for her expensive tastes and regularly strains the limits of her imperial stipend.  Her base of support is primarily the Temple of Dlamelish, in addition to certain factions within the Temple of Avanthe, but this is likely to evaporate if a stronger heiress appears. 

#### *The Powers Behind the Petal Throne*

*“Let the sycophants sing the glories of the Emperor before the Petal Throne; leave the glory of the Imperium to us\!”* **\-General Kettukal hiMraktine, First Legion of Ever-Present Glory and High General of All the Armies**

There are currently four major power blocs in the imperium.  For the most part, they are willing to peacefully engage with each other by means of political maneuvering. Should the limits of diplomacy be stretched thin, each political party prudently maintains their own fighting forces or can summon the aid of the assassin clans if a delicate touch is required.  Though the imperium is no stranger to internal conflicts, the spectre of civil war looms large upon the horizon.

**The Imperialist Party.**  Composed of the myriad courtiers, bureaucrats and functionaries that populate Avanthar, the men and women of the Imperialist Party are naturally invested in the status quo and the most resistant to attempts to reform the system.  Prominent members include the High Princeps of the Omnipotent Azure Legion and the Provost of the High Chancery, as well as some of the most influential personages in the empire.  They have made inroads towards cooperation with the Priestly Party, but consider the upstart ambitions of the Royalists too threatening and the Military Party’s expansion of the war to be dangerously reckless.

**The Military Party.**  Populated by noble officers of the Imperial Armies, including the generals of the First Legion of Ever-Present Glory, the Golden Sunburst Legion and the Legion of the Portals of Death.  Their foremost goal is a quick and decisive victory in the war with Yan Kor and diverting military resources towards a more profitable conflict with Salarvya.  Doubtlessly, this would benefit the Royalists, who would be called upon to govern the newly acquired lands.  The Military Party’s influence has traditionally swelled during wartime, putting them at odds with the Imperialists.  The Priestly Party opposes any further conflicts in foreign lands, likely due to their ties with the priesthoods of these nations. 

**The Priestly Party.** Drawn from the senior clergy of the Temples of the Gods, including the High Priests of Hnalla, Hru’u, Avanthe, Thumis and Dlamelish.  The Priestly Party is a highly fractious bloc, split primarily between the priesthoods of Stability and Change.  Other divisions and inter-faith alliances do occur as well, notably between the adherents of the war gods, who naturally favor the Military Party.  Religious tithes have made the Priestly Party extremely wealthy, owning and administrating enough land to rival the Royalists.  Their ultimate goal is to expand the powers of the temples until the imperium resembles a theocratic state akin to Livyanu, which informs many suspicions that they are in league with foreign cults.

**The Royalist Party.**  The Royalists claim descent from ancient Bednalljan and Engsvanyali nobility and are composed of great clans of landholders and administrators that keep the empire fed and well-run. The most prominent members include the Governor of Bey Su, the Governor of Jakalla and the Grand Legate of the Palace of the Realm.  The current state of affairs within the imperium serves them well enough, but their principal interest lay in installing themselves as Avanthar’s elite.  To this end the Royalists are willing to ally with the Priestly Party, but only if they curb their theocratic designs.  They also support the Military Party in the war effort, as victory would deliver new domains into the empire, the Royalists are eager to see lost fiefs return to their ancestral rulers.

##### The Histories of the Beloved, Very Great, and Powerful Emperors of the Most Mighty Imperium

The Tlakotani

### ***Yán Kór***

*“I swear it upon my clan-mother's eyes.”* **\-Yán Koryáni oath**

The youngest of the Five Empires, with the most to prove and everything to lose.  Yan Kor has risen to prominence only within the past few centuries, her people were barely a footnote in history, having no glorious ancestral empire to look back upon and only the briefest stewardship of Engsvanyalu prior to the Great Cataclysm.  Back in the days of the priest-kings, Yan Kor was an archipelago in the northern ocean when its shores lapped upon Milumanaya.  That islander sense of independence has not left the spirit of the Yan Koryani, even though millenia have passed since the waters fled.  The realm is a collection of city-states, clan-matriarchies and petty principalities, each with varying degrees of organization and no authority outside of their domains.  From his position as head of state, Baron Ald has attempted to impose a unified form of governance and the parochialism of old Yan Kor is slowly giving way to centralized rule.  The old rulership has retained their positions and much of their power, but all pay their taxes to the Baron’s regime in Yan Kor City.

Like most other northern nations, Yan Kor is a matriarchal culture, the birth of a baby girl is celebrated as a momentous occasion, while that of a boy done is simply as a formality.

Yan Kor traces its foundation to the reign of Tengguren Churitashmu, “the Iron Fist of the Peaks”, who briefly united the petty states of the north over a thousand years ago, these nations still count the years from this brief dynasty, it being the year 1140 A.T. by their reckoning.

The commoners of Yan Kor dwell in square wooden clanhouses with tiled roofs, surrounded by an outer palisade. These clanhouses are built around a central room, from which extend rambling subsections where different clan lineages live.  Wealthier clans live much the same, though their clanhouses can be up to three storeys tall and have a central dining hall, all surrounded by vegetable gardens and enclosed by stonework walls.  The upper class clans of Yan Kor dwell in elaborate clanhouses-citadels with multiple baths, kitchens and guest quarters.

**Dharu:** “The Forge of the North” rambling wooden clanhouses and clattering smithies

**Ngaku:** a secretive city blind walls and windowless turrets hinting at some monstrous commerce with the hidden denizens of LakeParunal

**Makhis:** the squared buttresses and bastions of Makhis which look down upon a forest of

##### Yan Kor City

all sombre basalt and dusky slate roofs;

The Yan Koryani are generally more welcoming of outsiders than the other Five Empires

Like many things in Yan Kor, water quality varies from city to city, the methods employed by the other Empires are known, but less rigorously practiced.  With virtually no guarantee of clean water, the Yan Koryani habitually boil their water before using it.  As befits the capital, Yan Kor City’s water supply has been modernized under the Baron’s reign, but there are many improvements to be made.

#### *The Gate That Does Not Open*

Born in the barbarian kingdom of Saa Allaqi, inter-tribal politics forced the young chieftain who would become the Baron Ald as to leave his people and find his fortune as a mercenary.  An excellent soldier, Ald rose to great heights in the imperial army of Tsolyanu eventually being promoted to general of the Legion of the Scarlet Plume. Ald became boon companions to General Kettukal hiMraktine of the First Legion of Ever-Present Glory and the prince Hirkane Tlakotani, future God-Emperor.  Betrayed by the political machinations of Tsolyanu’s elite, Ald and his legion were left to die at the Kaidrach Plains in Yan Kor.  What few survivors remained were captured by Yan Koryani forces and made ready for sacrifice, as befits but Ald was recognized as a mercenary and offered gold for his services.  

Embittered by the chicancery of the Tsolyani, Ald turned his strategic genius against them, rising to command the forces of Yan Kor City.  Through a combination of skill and luck, Ald repulsed further imperium expeditions sent north for plunder and slaves.  The city-states of Yan Kor quickly took notice and began to ally themselves under his banner, unified for the first time in centuries.  Other northern nations joined in the alliance, seeking to counter Tsolyani aggression, even the king of Saa Allaqi honored a man who was once the least of his vassals.  

To ease the delicate sensibilities of the Yan Koryani nobility, Ald has adopted the title of a middle-ranking fief holder.  As the Yan Koyani language has no term for a male “baroness”, Ald instead uses *Arsekme*, a Tsolyani loanword roughly equivalent to “baron”.  Make no mistake, Baron Ald has consolidated his power to such an extent that he is absolute monarch in all but name.  Despite this, the Baron is technically still of low social rank, which prohibits his marriage into the noble clans, however he has many mistresses, including Lady Si Ziris Qaya, Princess of the North, a barbarian from the icy realm of Hrga Lorunje and Lady Deq Dimani, sovereign of the island of Vridu and high priestess of the Lord of Sacrifice.  But first among the Baron’s mistresses is Lady Mmir, Princess of the High Clan of Ke’er, clan-cousin to the Baron’s deceased beloved, Lady Yilrana; together the Baron and Lady Mmir have had four children, three boys and a girl, all under the age of ten.  Should Yan Kor remain united after the war, his eldest daughter stands to inherit the empire, as is the custom in the northlands.


##### The Ebon Mistress

In addition to the barbarian mercenaries brought to swell the ranks of Yan Kor’s small militias, Baron Ald has pursued more esoteric means to augment the strength of his armies.  His advisor and virtual shadow is a strange person called Fu Shi’i, who provides the Baron with knowledge that would chill the blood of lesser folk.  Rumors speak of dark sorcery and pacts made with the terrible Pariah Gods, of bargains struck with the unseen crews of black ships from beyond the northern sea and of course, the Ebon Mistress. 

The plains of Yan Kor have their own secrets, ruins from the Time of Darkness, not yet picked clean by treasure hunters.  The most terrible of these treasures is an engine fashioned by the Great Ancients of prehistory, a cylinder the size of a house borne southward by a hundred *Chlen* and covered by a vast shroud for protection against the elements and prying eyes.  Accompanying this giant artifact are Yan Kor’s finest troops, the Valiant of Ke’er, who claim that even mighty fortifications like the *Sakbe-*roads cannot stand against the “kiss” of the Baron’s Ebon Mistress.

The Five Empires are not the only heirs of the golden age, the Engsvanyali culture took root in many lands across the breadth of the continent.  The Client States are nations whose rulers, willingly or not, submit to one of the great empires of the age.

### ***Chayákku***

Describing the tribes of Chayakku and their sister nations.

The tribes of Chayakku speak dialects of Aomorh, a notably diverse language group, a traveller coming from the next tribe over would be unintelligible.  

The dense forests of Chayakku and other northeastern states are composed primarily of the slender, black-needled conifers of *Tiu* trees. The dark, iron-hard wood of these trees are highly sought after imports in the Five Empires, used in everything from weapons and shields to the ritual masks of Livyani noblewomen.  The black needles are also used to brew a tea-like drink called *Las*, a popular beverage in the north, but described as “the northerner’s black piss” in the south.

Chayakku uses the northern calendar, counting the years from the reign of Tengguren Churitashmu, “the Iron Fist of the Peaks”, it is the year 1140 A.T. by this reckoning.

The Chayakkuyani are fiercely independent and generally unconcerned with the political situation in the west, but young warriors still journey to Yan Kor in search of fortune and glory.

The Chayakkuyani and other northeasterners dwell in semi-subterranean pit-houses built with timber roofs, their settlements defended by heavy log palisades.  These pit-houses typically only have one large room, but larger pit-houses may have up to ten rooms.  The Chayakkuyani elite live in castle-like citadels built from boulder-sized bricks, surrounded by palisades of fireproof *Nle* wood.

Chayakku was once the northernmost border of the Engsvnayali Empire, barely integrated into society before the island heaved itself half into the sea.  The Chayakkuyani still keep the ancestor deities of pre-Engsvanyali times, such as the Two Brothers, they hold that faithful Aridzo was slain by greedy Heshuel during a fight over their father’s patrimony.

### ***Milumanayá***

The tribes of Milumanaya are torn between their ancestral ways and the imperial ambitions of Yan Kor and Tsolyanu.

nomadic tribes of Milumanayá's Desert of Signs are so impoverished that they put every part of a human body to good use (the flesh is eaten, the skin tanned, the hair is spun into cord, the bones are made into tools, and so forth). Under extreme circumstances, a tribesman many even volunteer to be put to death to ensure the rest of the group has the materials it needs (such as a volunteer is called "one who serves")

The tribes of Milumanaya are nomadic, carrying their leather tents with them across the desert, kept well oiled to weather the frequent sandstorms of the region.  The interiors are deceptively spacious and are often partitioned by Hmelu wool blankets.  The city-dwelling Milumanayani favor low mud-brick domiciles with flat slate roofs, the richest living in multi-storey mansions.  The ruling elite dwell in low, rambling stone palaces, enclosed within walled fortifications and turrets.

Their ancient capital of Ssuganar lies in ruin within the borders of Pechano, the Grey Ssu frequently test the defenses of the Pechani, occasionally mounting brief incursions to their lost stronghold.  Curiously, there has not been any concerted attempt to retake the city in all of recorded history, most Ssu seem to avoid the place, with small teams

### ***Pijéna***

The small nation of Pijena has long suffered from its position as a border kingdom, but have also managed to profit from it.  Pijena lies between three of the Five Empires; Tsolyanu to the south, Mu’ugalavya to the west, and Yan Kor to the east.  It’s people, the Pijenani, are an adaptable lot, having grown accustomed to the changing of winds and foreign overlords.  Their culture does not give the same weight to “noble action” as other Engsvanyali societies, instead preferring to keep a cynical pragmatism that other nations find utterly ignoble.  The Pijenani will play both sides of a conflict in order to benefit from whatever outcome occurs, much to

### ***Saá Allaqí***

Homeland of the Baron Ald, Saa Allaqi is on the cusp of a religious schism, as the traditionalists are becoming irate at the Baron’s reforms.

The commoners of Saa Allaqi dwell in square wooden clanhouses with tiled roofs, surrounded by an outer palisade. These clanhouses are built around a central room, from which extend rambling subsections where different clan lineages live.  Wealthier clans live much the same, though their clanhouses can be up to three storeys tall and have a central dining hall, all surrounded by vegetable gardens and enclosed by stonework walls.  The upper class clans of Saa Allaqi dwell in elaborate clanhouses-citadels with multiple baths, kitchens and guest quarters. 

Though the mountainous landscape may seem unfavorable for their kind, there is a sizable population of Pe Choi that dwell in Saa Allaqi.  Their ancestors were members of the Tsolyani regiment, the Legion of the Forest of Hh-kk-ssa, given a diplomatic mission by the God-Emperor Neshkiruma “the Cloud-Spinner”.  The Pe Choi army was sent to entreat the king of Saa Allaqi into an alliance to reconquer Milumanaya, which had recently seceded from the Imperium.  The legion was welcomed as guests of the king, who outwardly entertained the notion of assistance, but truthfully had no interest in having the Imperium on his doorstep once again.  The Pe Choi were allowed to freely travel the city under escort, prisoners of Saa Allaqi but held in great esteem, even assisting the king in combating rebels near Lake Parunal.

The Imperium had thought the legion to have been wiped out and considered it lost, until decades later, when news finally reached the God-Emperor Gyesmu “the Iron Fist”, who sent orders for the legion’s recall and included a letter to the king threatening Tsolyani vengeance if they were not allowed to return home.  The king dithered and procrastinated enough that the surviving members of Legion of the Forest of Hh-kk-ssa decided honor their oaths to the Imperium and escape out of the kingdom, settling their affairs and leaving behind their families in Saa Allaqi, lest the new God-Emperor’s wrath fall upon them.  The Pe Choi are Saa Allaqiyani in every detail, those that can still speak their native tongue do so poorly.

Saa Allaqi uses the northern calendar, counting the years from the reign of Tengguren Churitashmu, “the Iron Fist of the Peaks”, it is the year 1140 A.T. by this reckoning.

The archers of Saa Allaqi aren’t especially talented, but their bows are considered the finest in the Five Empires.  Made from the *Ruqqa* plant

Larger homes have additional rooms but also possess thatched roofing, regularly brushed with pitch to ward off rainfall from dripping onto its inhabitants.

The calendar system of the Hlaka is simple and perplexing, time begins anew every hundred years, the prior century of history is forgotten entirely and might as well have never happened.  Under this arcane measurement, it has only been 33 years since time began to flow again.

The Hlaka of Chaynegar Range are divided into various “tribes”, each with varying degrees of cooperation and animosity.  The cultural distinction between these tribes is lost on humans and most other sophonts, when asked, Hlaka typically identify themselves as either “One of the Air” or “One of the Lightnings” or as a member of another tribe with a similarly opaque name.  There seems to be a particular contention between the Air and Lightning tribes, which are the two largest of the region, who have been seen to darken the skies with bloody airborne melees.   

None of the tribes go near the eerie stronghold of Old Hlaka, not even daring to fly above it.

### ***Mihállu***

*“Life itself is art.”* **\-Mihálluyani proverb.**

The Mihalluyani still hold to the ways of the Golden Age, as if the Ever-Glorious Engsvan hla Gangnever never fell.  The furthest colony of the Engsvanyali, nestled within a fertile river valley surrounded by barbarians, barren mountains and barren desert.  The mountainsides of Mihallu are littered with monuments hewn into the images of priest-kings and rarely, the alien ruins of the long-extinct Mihalli are discovered.

The small nation is a bastion of civilization amidst barbarism and desolation

The Mihallyani dislike the inelegant calendar of Kazhilo’ob and prefer the Old Engsvanyali system that the ancient priest-king had attempted to replace, which places the current year as 21,776 O.E.

The Mihalluyani build their homes out of wattle and daub, most are single-storey, with only a handful of rooms inside.  Larger homes have additional rooms but also possess thatched roofing, regularly brushed with pitch to ward off rainfall from dripping onto its inhabitants.  Mihalluyani nobles dwell in squat, cylindrical towers built from stout masonry surrounded by palisades of noncombustible *Nlè-*wood.

Local legends claim that Shape-Changers once ruled the peoples of this land, though their relationship to the near-mythical Mihalli race is unknown.

#### *The Plains of Glass* 

The lonely, windswept wasteland of the Plains of Glass are a monument to mankind’s folly and short-sightedness.  Legends claim it was once a lush and verdant land, until the last wars between the Lords of the Latter Times and the Mihalli, when terrible weapons were unleashed.  No drop of water has fallen upon these broken shards in nearly 500 years.  Most of these glass shards are harmless, worn down by dry winds and sandals of adventurers.  The largest shards can be meters across, but are also the most brittle, sometimes breaking if overburdened, sending careless creatures into pits of jagged glass.

The Unstraightened City

The Unstraightened City was destroyed long before the priest-kings of Engsvanyalu came to power.  Most historians in the Five Empires believe some upstart princelings during the age of the Three States of the Triangle used some deadly weapon of the Great Ancients against their Mihalli enemies, reducing lush savannah to barren glass and casting the Shape-Changers into extinction.

Though regarded as crackpottery by reputable archaeologists, countless fruitless expeditions have been sent forth to find the ruins of this lost city, either returning alive but ashamed or vanishing altogether, assumed to have perished in the Plains of Glass.  Of all the ill-fated expeditions, only one could have possibly done the impossible.  Metallja of Salarvya, the heresiarch of the Blasphemous Accelerators, a monastic sect who rejected all gods, claiming they were sabotaging mortal development and whose ultimate goal was to somehow cut Tekumel from divine influence.  In the closing days of the Time of No Kings, Metallja and his Accelerators set off in search of the Unstraightened City, never to return.

Perhaps the Accelerators sought to exploit the exotic properties of the Unstraightened City, where legends say all of time and space converges.  If one knew the correct paths through the city, one could walk from world to world or era to era, as easily as you would the rooms of your clan-house.  Though the Unstraightened City is assumed to be from the Time of Darkness, its founding actually lays in the age before the human conquest of Tekumel, back when the Mihalli had made first contact with the planet’s inhabitants.

The Salarvyani monk Metallja still dwells in the Unstraightened City, despite the millenia that have passed since the first Accelerators left the Five Empires.  The Mihalli consider Metallja their king, but he is more their prisoner than anything. Finding the lost metropolis seems to have been easier than leaving it.

#### *The Underworlds*

	*“Ditlana must be done, or else we are no more noble than beasts.”*	**\-Tsolyáni proverb**

The Underworlds are a byproduct of the practice of *Ditlana* (“the Renewing”), a ceremonial form of urban renewal where every 500 years or so, a city’s buildings are razed, the cellars filled with the rubble and the foundations of a newer, more splendid structure built upon them.  The custom dates back to the early Bednalljan Dynasty, but the Engsvanyali gleefully adopted this custom when their empire rose to dominance and spread across the continent.  For some obscure scriptural purpose, the ancient priest-kings bade that certain shrines be maintained even if they were lost to *Ditlana*. The modern-day Temples remain faithful to this decree and guard their subterranean shrines, using them to store sacred relics and initiate members into their mystery cults. 

Some cities are considered overdue for Ditlana, typically due to financial difficulties or other exigent circumstances, the city of Bey Su, for example, is 378 years late and the priests grow more and more importunate.

These subterranean labyrinths become a haven for lost and forgotten things; clanless derelicts take refuge in the shallow levels from the cruelties of the world above.  Any criminal worth their salt knows how to use the tunnels to hide from the authorities and smuggle in contraband for the night markets.   Deeper below, unnatural creatures prowl galleries once walked by mighty kings and queens of days long past, these mutants and monstrosities are colloquially known as the “Underpeople”.

To journey into a *Tsuru’um* (“Underworlds”) is to dive into the ocean of the past.  The deeper adventurers descend they will find themselves uncovering buried secrets, exploring the catacombs of forgotten civilizations, discovering vast complexes of steel and vitrified stone built by the Great Ancients or stumbling into lost cavern-cities of prehuman Tékumel. 

Jakalla’s Underworld is among the largest in all of Tekumel, rivalled only by Ch’ochi in Mu’ugalava, Tsamra in Livyanu, and Jgresh in Salaravya. Within the Tsolyani Imperium, Jakalla must contend with both Purdimal and the City of Sarku for sheer depth, the latter being home to “The Well Which Pierces the World”.

By the reckoning of the Five Empires, civilization has yet to reach further north than Ghaton or N’lussa, and even these are poor examples.  The Engsvanyali Empire did not scramble for conquests, their expansions were slow and methodical, with a patience borne from the confidence knowing the gods.

### ***Ghatón***

*“As drunken as a Ghatóni at prayer.”* **\-Mu'ugalavyáni saying**

The fervently patriarchal Ghatoni are grudgingly allied with the matriarchal Yan Koryani, but only against the imperial ambitions of Mu’ugalavya.

The Ghatóni trace the foundation of their nation to the princelings of the Dragon Warriors, from a time called the Fifth Age of the Cupped Hands of the Flame.

Ghaton uses the northern calendar, counting the years from the reign of Tengguren Churitashmu, “the Iron Fist of the Peaks”, it is the year 1140 A.T. by this reckoning.

Ghatoni women are seldom glimpsed in public and never without a male relative, typically their father, brother or husband.  Unescorted women run the risk of being harassed by an enraged mob and being pelted by stones, a custom the Ghatoni would generously extend to nonhumans, should they know the differences between their sexes.

All Ghatoni, male and female alike, go about clad in costumes of dark, many-layered cloth, much to the ridicule of their southern betters, who commonly jest that these northern savages even sleep in their clothes\!  Their hygienic practices leave much to be desired, only bathing once a week and washing their garments even less often.

The Engsvanyali clan-system took root in Ghaton, but has developed into all-male “fraternities”, 

which trade women 

The common Ghatoni dwell in rude stone huts with an outer palisade of timber.  Wealthier Ghantoni live in round houses built from wood and stone, up to three storeys tall, centered around a large fire pit and common room.  The nobility live in stonework towers either built on high crags or defended by ramparts of hard-packed earth, log palisades or a deep moat.

### ***N'lüss***

*“We are the People, and our lands are the World. All else is the concern of others and their gods.”* **\-N'lǘss saying**

The descendants of the Dragon Warriors, who nearly conquered the world in their age.  They are fiercely independent and constantly harass their Mu’ugalavyani neighbors to the south.

N’luss society is centred around the ónürr (“band”), a large group consisting of warriors of various prominence, their families and servants.  Though certainly possessing the appearance of a mob of bloody reavers, these bands are closely-knit communities akin to clans in the Five Empires.  In typical N’luss fashion, bloodshed colors much of the band’s culture; a youth must mount the head of an enemy warrior upon his housepost before becoming a man and every winter solstice, maidens become women by dancing around a bonfire, clad only in the flayed skin of her foe.  A warrior bringing home glory and plunder is celebrated, the band sharing in the triumph of their own; however, the band also bears responsibility for the shameful acts of its members.  If one brings shame to their band too often, they may be hung upside-down with their head in a bucket, into which the house’s chamber-pots are emptied.

Each band is ruled by a *sárq* (“chieftain”), a hereditary position, akin to minor nobility in other lands.  The *sárq* is the principal authority within his band, his only equal being his wife, who possesses the title and position of *sárq* for as long as her husband lives.  Though legally these women cannot rule their bands on their own, they remain powerful advisors to the sons that inherit the title.  Nl’uss bands frequently war amongst themselves, provoked by the feuds between different *sárqs,* but if the conflict grows too great, the belligerents may be summoned to Malchairan to answer to the *sa-sarq* (“great-chieftain”).

Practice slash and burn agriculture

The N’luss live in domicles called *thén* (“roundhouse”), these are often little more than rude stone huts, but those of wealthier bands can be up to three storeys tall.  Each *thén* is centered around a large fire pit and common room, with the entire property surrounded by a log palisade.  Noble N’luss live in stonework towers built on high crags, defended by ramparts of hard-packed earth, log palisades or a deep moat.

Bands of N’luss mercenaries have been marching southward and northeast, following the promise of gold and bloodshed.  Their Mu’ugalavani neighbors have attempted to stem the flow of these giant warriors with massive garrisions, but through bribery or murder the N’luss keep coming.


##### Malchairan		

Malchairan was once the proud and glorious capital of the Dragon Warriors, but is now a monument to decay.  The city has shrunk considerably from its former sprawl, more of a large town built within a crumbling urban sprawl.  The city centre isn’t in much better condition, consisting of ramshackle huts and derelict hovels scattered aimlessly near a squalid marketplace.  Only the *sa-sarq’s* citadel has seen any maintenance, but it is a mishmash of half-completed architecture that defies reason and is falling apart as quickly as new wings are built.

Khársa of Tsámra-Láris carried the Petal Throne from Malcháiran to Avanthár, so legends say.

### ***The Northeastern Frontier***

*“Men act not because of themselves but because of some slight to their great-grandfather's pisspot.”* **\-Tsolyáni adage**

The barbarian states of the northeast briefly knew the glory of Engsvanyali civilization.

Northeastern women go about with light veils when strangers are present, looking pitifully on their “poor, naked southern sisters.”

The northeast employs an eight-year cyclical calendar, every year is given a name: the Tree, the Stone, the Peak, the Sun, the First Moon, the Second Moon, the Spear and the Slaying.  This is supplemented by the regnal year of the local ruler, it is currently the year of the Sun and the 34th year of King Jnares of Nuru’un.

**Nuru’un:** the nation of Nurun

The Nur’un still keep the primeval gods of pre-Engsvanyali times, such as the Two Brothers, they hold that wise Heshuel was slain by foolish Aridzo during a fight over their father’s patrimony.

The theocratic islanders of Nyemesel are known to be a gentle people, but 

Nyemeseli commoners typically dwell in adobe farmhouses with less than a dozen rooms, with flat tiled roofs and surrounded by mid-brick walls.  Larger dwellings are much the same, but two or three storeys tall and open pillared porches in lieu of windows.  The wealthy live in elaborate porticoed mansions, with private apartments surrounding a central courtyard.  The nobility keep palatial apartments within vast pyramidal temple complexes, each of which is almost a small city, with fortified walls and lush gardens for the pleasure of its inhabitants.

The priests of Mretten keep to their own obscure dating methods, counting time from the mythical Emergence of the Goddess from the Sea of Night.  By this calendar, the Nyemeseli claim it is the year 2972 in the 301st Cycle of the Fifth Age, a Cycle is 3000 years long, but the number of Cycles in an Age is known only to the priesthood.

The lost city of Bayshara has tantalized explorers for millenia, it isn’t known when tales of a glittering city in the jungle began to the Five Empires, but every so often, travellers return with harrowing stories of escape.

The jungles surrounding the lost city of Bayshara are nearly impenetrable, few are willing to risk their lives on fruitless expeditions to locate the legendary metropolis, if it exists at all.  The Baysharans themselves prefer it that way, going to great lengths to keep invaders out, but those that manage to pierce the jungles are unerringly located.

Baysharans kill or enslave any invaders that stumble upon their hidden city, the most comely captives are destined for the harems of the elite.

### ***Shenyu***

*“The smell is too wrong.”* **\-Shen adage**

The southwestern nation of the reptilian Shen, equal in strength to any of the Five Empires, but more concerned with their own alien politics.  Though it has the appearance of a centralized empire like those of humanity, the nation colloquially known as “Shenyu” is but a confederation of many Shen states cooperating with varying degrees of antagonism, each populated by a dominant *Hrg-Ssa* ("Egg-Group") and several other minor egg-groups with which they are allied. 

The lands of Shenyu are mostly plains and marshes, interspersed with copses of twisting *Gye* trees.  This close to the equator, the temperatures are blisteringly hot, enjoyable to the Shen, but only tolerable to humans during the winter months.  The cities of the Shen are distinctive for their low, sprawling architecture, they seem to be unable or unwilling to build more than a single story in height.

#### *The Shen Calendar*

The Shen follow their own cyclical calendar made up of multiples of seven: it is now the first year of the *Sr* (7 years), the 6th *Sr* of the 5th *Sr-Ti* (49 years), of the first *Khu* (343 years), of the 3rd *Khu-Ti* (2,401 years), of the 3rd *Ssor* (16,807 years), of.the 5th *Ssor-Ti* (117,649 years), of the 3rd *Hsse* (823,543 years); in other words it is the year 2,979,873, by Shen reckoning. The labyrinthine libraries of Ssorya would seem to prove such a monumental feat of recordkeeping, if one could make sense of the Shen organization system.

### ***Land of the Tané***

The lands beyond the Unknown Forest, home to a people who ride beasts for sport and battle.

The Tane people dwell in small villages of wood huts, built in clearings of their great coniferous forests.  

The climate is cooler on average than the Five Empires, likely due to the misty forests blocking the heat.  

Unlike the Five Empires and their fellows, the Tane have no compunction towards mingling beasts with warfare.  Creatures such as the six-legged *bazhaq* and draconic *sro* are utilized as riding animals, the Tane raising the beasts from birth to foster a bond with humans.  To become a *bazhaq* rider is a great honor, requiring bravery and skill, as one will be called to ride at the vanguard of theri fief-lord.  

The forests of Tane are separated into countless feifs, each ruled by a lord, who jockey and quarrel for new lands for their domains.  Arable land is in short supply in these dense forests and even then, the soil is not particularly fertile, thus much of the region’s agriculture remains at subsistence-level farming.  

The Tane are but of many peoples dwelling upon the lands past the Unknown Forest

The northern river delta is home to impoverished tribes fond of human flesh.  Mostly they eat their own dead, ensuring the strength of their tribe remains undiminished, but grim necessity may demand headhunters range forth in search of fresh game.  Despite their ghoulish diets, the cannibal tribes aren’t considered a great threat, as they are frequently in conflict with each other, stronger tribes consuming weaker ones or capturing enemy warriors to feed on their power.  

To the south lies a port city whose inhabitants are culturally distinct from the Tane, they have a robust trade relationship with the Tane and the sea-faring Chima.

To the east lies a small, but powerful confederation of fiefs rich enough to afford *sro* riders, 

#### *The Black Island*

Off the western shores of Tane, lies the Black Island, home of the Citadel of Bassa and its inhabitants, the Ssu.  Beneath the waves lies a natural stone causeway that connects the Black Island to the mainland, this remains submerged except during low tide, when the waters retreat.  The rocky reefs surrounding the Black Island prohibit landing by any ships larger than a canoe, which makes walking the safest means to travel back and forth.

On rare occasions, hordes of Ssu and Shen warriors march across the seapath to raid the Tane, but the Ssu here seem to be nominally more peaceful than their fellows in the Five Empires.  The presence of Shen among their ranks is troubling, whether this is some ancient alliance or if the Shen serve the great enemy is unknown.

#### *The Unknown Forest*

The border region between Mmorcha and the Land of the Tane, a perilous jungle littered with ruined cities of the Great Ancients.

The Nom are rather prudish by the standards of the Five Empires, abstaining from sexual relations outside of their polagamous marriages, typically two men and three women, though other variations occur from island to island, but always done in fives.  This is doen in reflection

they are also known to possess many obscure taboo and a predilection for living sacrifice, either by drowning, hanging or burning, depending on the crime.

The Nóm are infrequently seen in the Five Empires, though traders (and pirates) can be encountered in eastern Salarvya.  Little is known about their culture, though it is believed that Nom magicians are called by the name of the first spell they learn.

#### *The Tubeways*

Deep beneath the surface of Tekumel lies an extensive network of tunnels carved with unimaginable means by the Great Ancients.  The Tubeways can be used to traverse to distant lands, some within the Five Empires but most to realms unknown to civilization.  It is inadvisable to travel the Tubeways on foot, the sheer distance between stations is prohibitive and one is likely to die of starvation before ever stepping into sunlight again.  The Great Ancients instead rode the Tubeways within egg-shaped vehicles which effortlessly float within the tube by unknown means.   These ovoid cabs can be summoned via control panels installed in every station, arriving from the nearest garage-complex to the requested location in a matter of minutes.  The meanings behind the sharp, blocky letters upon these control panels have thus far eluded the most brilliant linguists of Tekumel, but fortunately they are distinctive enough to be recognized and appear to be identical across the planet, the Great Ancients' reach was truly incredible.

The smallest cabs can only transport a handful of occupants, the largest can carry dozens, in addition to whatever items are stored in the cargo bay.  Few know of the existence of these Tubeways and fewer still have actually ridden within a cab, so these vehicles often still contain artifacts of the Great Ancients.

Their civilization is coordinating and funding expeditions to map the Tubeway network, compiling reports for study at their universities.

The homeland of the Urunen is a pleasant, temperate realm where the passage of time itself seems distorted, the sun may dance across the sky or refuse to rise in the morning.  During the day, cool streams of meltwater flow from the glaciers that cling to the mountains, the chill touch of rime comes with the dark of night.  Few other sophonts would find this bizarre climate welcoming, but the Urunen speak fondly of the endless days and frigid nights.

The capital city is an enormous sprawling metropolis centered around a massive, cubical temple built atop the planet’s south magnetic pole.

Urunen civilization is millenia old, equal to any of the Five Empires and has weathered internal unrest, civil wars, reconquest and reconciliation.  The empire is a highly centralized parliamentary monarchy, though the nobility are purely figureheads and are not regarded highly by the populace.

The era of the Urunen dates back to the reign of the matriarch Arevi Hu, and their year is thus 9,759.

## **The Periplus of Further Voyaging**

There are a panoply of worlds that exist beyond Tekumel, from the paradises of gods to the hells of demons and myriad realms of mortals; some fantastical, some deceptively similar to our own.

From treatises on other-planar realms such as the The Pandects of Those Who Journey Beyond, the Engsvanyali knew of four mystical directions, grai, chio, grel and vraz, often scholars liken them to the ordinal directions (northwest, northeast, southwest and southeast), but this is merely an approximation for mortal reckoning.  Each has an associated color, 'untet, 'unpur, 'unway and 'unshap, these colors appear as white to the human eye, though some sorceresses can take notice of these otherworldly hues, but otherwise they remain on the edge of perception.  Other races, particularly the sea-faring Chima can see them quite frequently and make use of dyes of these colors, though it is unknown how they acquire or manufacture them.

#### *Nexus Points*

Compared to the Sidereal Universe, Tékumel’s reality is much thinner, this permeability allows magicians to channel power from the Planes Beyond. Certain regions are even thinner than usual and the flow of otherworldly energies has worn holes in the fabric of space-time, magicians covet these “Nexus Points”, using them to fuel their sorcery.  Nexus Points appear as flickering translucent grey ovals hanging in space, barely perceptible by the naked eye, but blindingly obvious to sorcery.  Some are large enough to admit three humans standing abreast, while others are hardly larger than a copper *quirgal*. Nexus Points behave according to incomprehensible physical laws; some remain perfectly immobile, while others move slightly year after year, others appear only at the confluence of certain planets.  Some of these Nexus Points have stabilized enough to allow travel between them, a magician who knows the correct paths can journey the Planes Beyond, travel to distant lands and further realms, or even across the gulfs of time. 

### ***The Planes Beyond***

The planes whirl about each other in an intricate dance, the Scrolls of Pavar contain diagrams that the prophet claims to be the topology of the multiverse

### ***The Many Worlds***

The multiverse is vast beyond imagining, some worlds are realms of bizarre phenomena, others are so similar to our own one could search for lifetimes and only find a blade of grass out of place.

### ***The Demon Planes***

The Demon Planes are not a single realm, but a collection of demiplanes and pocket dimensions haphazardly lashed together like a castaway’s raft.  These planes are divided by Quadrant and Circles, most of which are ruled by the Demon Princes, save for thirty-nine circles held by demons allied with the Lords of Stability.

### ***The End of Time***

If the old epics are to be believed, the legendary Subadim the Sorcerer retired to fish the River of Souls at the College of the Undying Wizards at the end of time.

# **Deeds of the Ever-Glorious \- Character Options**

###### 

## **Styles of Play**

### ***Fresh off the Boat***

Newcomers to the lands of the Five Empires

Secret Societies 

A multitude of clandestine organizations exist within and without the Five Empires, each attempting to steer events towards their benefit 

### ***Swords of the Imperium***

Defenders of your empire against her enemies.

### ***War of Wizards***

###### The College of Undying Wizards is an organization of magicians from across the history of Tekumel.  From their stronghold at the End of Time they vie to study and influence the timelines while thwarting their rivals.  Each of the Undying Wizards is a nation unto themselves, employing agents across time and facilitating travel to distant eras across the hidden paths of time.

### ***The Concordat***

A joint venture between the Temples of Change and Stability, with all the travails that contains.

### ***Heroes of the Age***

During times of great tumult or misrule, the Gods tangle the Skeins of five or so persons to become the “Heroes of the Age’, charged with defending Tekumel from interplanar threats like the all-consuming Pariah Deities.  The last Heroes of the Age arose just prior to the collapse of the Golden Age, it can be argued they failed, but who can say if a greater disaster was prevented? 

### ***Those Who Journey Beyond***

Exploring the boundaries of Tekumel and perhaps even the Many Worlds.  There appears to be a secret society of some sort providing support to interplanar visitors upon Tekumel.

## **The Tékumelani \- Race Options**

The vast majority of Tékumel’s sophonts, flora & fauna are not native, though this is the only world they’ve known. Earth and other homeworlds live only half-remembered in myth, much like the stars themselves. Each Tekumelani culture has their own origin tale, stories of the gods summoning ancestral heroes from across the Many Worlds for the Battle of Dormoron Plain, even the Pe Chói have their “Round of Hkek Qten”. Currently the Engsvanyáli version of “The Lament to the Wheel of Black”, is the most popular, though the earlier epochs of the Bednalljan Dynasty and the Llyáni Empire too had their own epics regarding the same myth.

For the most part, the sophonts that populate Tekumel are the same as those who first walked the planet millenia ago.  But the Time of Darkness and subsequent ages broke whatever bonds that once united these creatures. Some friendships remain strong, such as humanity and the Pe Choi; while the Ssu and the Hluss have never forgiven the theft of their world.

### 	***Tsóluyal \- Humans***

*“Humans dance about like glow-worms, and make almost as much sense.”* **\-Pé Chói proverb**

Since prehistory, humanity has shaped Tekumel according to their wishes.  The peoples of the modern age walk proudly amongst their own accomplishments, but ignorant amidst the wonders of their titanic forebears.  The nations described earlier are but a sample of the myriad of cultures that dwell upon every hill and valley of the planet.  The sophisticated cultures of these peoples have developed over millennia of intertwining history between themselves and their nonhuman neighbors.  None of their customs are without meaning and always a subtle reflection on how they see their place in the world.

The humans of Tekumel are the same sort that exist today, capable of great acts of selfishness and altruism, violence and pacifism, ignorance and sagacity.  They are descended from colonists from Central America, South Asia, North Africa and other tropical regions of Old Earth.  Most humans stand around five feet tall, but there are outliers like the N'luss peoples that can reach upwards of seven feet.  Humans uniformly possess brownish skin, made darker in hotter climates and lighter complexions are uncommon.  Black or brown hair is the norm, though populations like the Lorun can have auburn hair, but blondes would be considered curiosities.  Blue eyes are rare enough to beget superstitious fear, such as the so-called Curse of Avanthe.

#### *Bednalljan Kinship*

*“Let my husband be whatever he may be, so long as he is not a drunkard and does not stink.  It is his clan which concerns me, for it is with his mothers, sisters, aunts and other kinfolk that my children and I must live out our lives.”* **\-Nalitha, protagonist of the Tsolyani play; “The Four Flowers of the Stream”**

Love has very little to do with marriage in the Five Empires, where it is more of a legal agreement, meant to link lineages or clans together.  Love can bloom, on occasion, but ultimately it is not necessary for the fulfillment of the contract.  Clan-elders meticulously arrange the marriages of their clan-children, sometimes before they are even born\!  In the patrilocal south, brides are brought to live in their husband's clan-house; while in the matrilocal north, husbands go to live with their bride’s family.  

Divorce is simple, either party announces it publicly and after the dowry is repaid, the deed is done.  Adultery is rarely cause for dispute, unless infidelity was made a specific provision of the marriage contract.  Polygamy is particularly commonplace among the upper classes and their clan-houses are populated with collections of spouses gained via politcal agreement.  To be thirty and unmarried is something of an embarrassment, but so long as one is noble and forthright in their reasons, it can be excused.

Within the Five Empires, familial piety is considered among the noblest of actions and similar attitudes hold sway in other nations.  These families are colloquially known as lineages, extended bloodlines founded by great ancestors from ages long past.  High ranking clans typically only have a handful of lineages and most other clans have dozens or even hundreds, while the lineages of low ranking clans often cannot claim a single heroic ancestor and slaves have no lineages at all.  This familial structure is part of the cultural bedrock in lands once part of the Engsvanyali Empire, the further one travels beyond these borders, other models hold sway. 

As children are raised communally within a clan-house, one’s actual parentage is less important; one’s father and his brothers are your fathers, while your mother and her sisters are your mothers.  All of the children of these persons are considered your brothers and sisters.  Further, your mother’s brothers are your uncles and father’s sisters are your aunts, as are their respective spouses and their children are your cousins.

*(the closest analogue for reference is the Iroquois kinship model)* 

 

##### The Aridani

The Five Empires have fairly strict gender roles, women are expected to be “good clan-girls”, obedient to the wishes of her clan-elders, be dutiful wives and mothers, raising the next generation with her clan-sisters.  In return, she will want for nothing, being part of a supportive community that provides for her every need, in addition to being immune to direct legal action.  The average clan-woman works alongside her clan-brothers in their ancestral trade; farmers labor in fields, metalsmiths in the forges, scribes in the archives, etc.  Only nobleborn clan-women may find anything approaching boredom, but may find outlets in hobbies or other pursuits, much like their clan-brothers.

Established during Engsvanyali times, any woman who does not desire the quiet, peaceful life of her clan-house may elect to become *aridáni* (‘independent’).  After a woman becomes an adult, (roughly 14-15 years of age) but before she is married, she can go to her local temple and declare herself *aridáni* before a priest and at least two witnesses. After becoming *aridáni*, she forgoes the privileges and protections of a woman and is considered a man in the eyes of the law.  She can serve in the army, enter the priesthood, own land, and marry as many husbands as she can afford.

There is no social opprobrium attached to becoming *aridáni*, you are still considered a valued member of your clan, who have no more control over you than your clan-brothers. That said, there may be some grumbling if you refuse a particularly advantageous marriage that had been arranged on your behalf.  Otherwise, the only drawbacks to becoming *aridáni* are the same encountered by menfolk, most notably that legal repercussions now fall squarely on you.  Women are legally exempt from the prosecution of crimes, with punishments instead falling upon her clan, usually in the form of a fine.

This practice is firmly established in the cultures of the Five Empires, except matriarchal Yan Kor, where it is wholly unnecessary.  Other nations have varying degrees of male-female equality; for example, Ghaton being fervently patriarchal and Milumanaya being completely egalitarian.  Foreign women travelling within the Five Empires are not subject to this practice, though misunderstandings can still occur. 

The Alu

*A similar tradition is also practiced by menfolk in the Five Empires, often considered the “counter-Aridani” , an alu is man who forgoes the independence and privileges of his sex.  Choosing instead to live as a dependent of the clan, like his clan-sisters, they are distinguished by their veils* 

#### 	*Chayákkuyáni*

With skin like dusty bronze and straight black hair, the Chayakkuyani are stockier and taller than their Yan Koryani cousins, due to intermarriage with the Lorun peoples of the far north.  They are known for having great passion and pride, but also a troublesome impatience.

##### Chayákkuyáni Names

The peoples of the far northeast possess the personal name by that of the town or village in which they live: e.g . Tsí Chá Vü (Tsi Cha of Vu).

#### *Ghatóni*

Ghaton began as a colony of N’luss, but centuries of intermarriage with their Yan Koryani neighbors have made them shorter and stockier than their ancestors.  They have a reputation for being quarrelsome and moody, but honorable in their own strange way.

##### Ghatoni Names

Ghatóni names are patronymic, simply adding their father’s personal name to their own: e.g. Chgá Njú (Chgá, son of Njú). 

#### *Lorún*

The Lorun tribes of the far north are much like their distant cousins, the N’luss, tall and muscular in body, vulgar and corybantic in demeanor.  They have skin like burnished brass and reddish-brown hair, often kept in elaborate braids.  They are nomadic and are generally quite xenophobic, but their recent alliance with Yan Kor and allure of southern riches has all but quashed the voices of the more intractable matriarchs.

Lorun Names

Lorun names are matronymic and consist of two parts, a personal name and the name of your mother.  If your father is of high-status, his mother’s name is added after: e.g. Srí Zíris Qayá (Sri, daughter of Ziris, paternal granddaughter of Qaya).

#### *Jánnuyáni*

The people of the mountain nation of Jannu are short with thin, wiry builds.  They are dusky skinned, with dark brown hair and dark-colored eyes.  The Jannuyani are nominally more organized than their cousins from Kilalammu, having a tribal council called the Assembly of Spears.  They are seen as being excitable rustics and naive of the world outside their mountain valleys.

##### Jannuyani Names

Jannuyani names have two parts, a personal name given at birth and use the name of their tribe as a surname: e.g. Menaho Shau (Menaho of the Shau tribe).

#### *Kilalámmuyáni*

The Kilalammuyani are short with thin, wiry builds like their cousins from Jannu.  With dusky skin, dark brown hair and dark-colored eyes.  The Kilalámmuyáni are fiercely independent, but are little more than a fractious bunch of feuding tribes than a true nation.  They are just as rustic as the Jannu, but are known for never forgetting any wrong done to them.

##### Kilalammuyani Names

Kilalammuyani names have two parts, a personal name given at birth and the name of their tribe as a surname: e.g. Dikosu Vai (Dikosu of the Vai tribe). Due to their proximity to Pechano, some Kilalammyani may have Pechani names by ancestry.

#### *Livyáni*

The Livyani are tall and slender with graceful builds, dun-hued complexions and wavy black or dark brown hair.  Being descended from the near-mythical Empire of Llyan, the Livyani have a not entirely unwarranted reputation for being smug and conceited, but are also considered a highly cultured and principled people. Livyáni adults tattoo their faces with intricate designs called *Aomüz*, the patterns representing the wearer’s clan, city, and religious affiliation.

##### Livyani Names

Livyáni names consist of three parts, a personal name, one’s lineage and one's birthplace.  Nobility are addressed with the titles of *Dumúz* or *Dumúab*, meaning “Brother” or “Sister" (of the faith), respectively.

***Livyáni Names:*** (*male*) Búoz, Chákmaz, Eúz, Gámuz, Nyeranáz, Otunúz, Súruz, Táluvaz, Tékmuz, Zhúvaz; (*female*) Báluab, Dáileb, Dísib, Esúeb, Isu'ab, Káeb, Láilueb, Méshab, Sárab, Síyuneb

***Livyáni Lineages:*** Anyál, Árrio, Asuaz, Belkómin, Buódla, Chiúna, Chráio, Dlá, Dlékka, Easámüz, Essúra, Kormuz, Minaz, Murúshu, Ojjé, Reosámrüz, Shákh, Shritlimáno, Súriz, Viyu

#### *Mihálluyáni*

The Mihalluyani have a brownish-yellow complexion and dark black hair; they commonly have very angular facial features.  They are quite easy-going and generally uninterested in the goings-on outside of their long river valley, but are prone to quoting Engsvanyali proverbs or obscure koans as the situation demands.

##### Mihalluyani Names

The Mihalluyani claim to follow Engsvanyali naming customs, in which a child receives only a "pet name" until puberty, whereupon it is inducted into the clan and is given a proper name: e.g. Tenggútla Dayyár.

#### *Milumanayáni*

As a border region, the Milumanayáni share ancestry with both Yan Kor and Tsolyanu, but on average are short with slender, wiry builds, a coppery complexion and coarse black hair. The nomads of the Desert of Sighs have a reputation of being anarchic and argumentative, but display great dignity and respect towards others.  The Milumanayáni cities of Pelesar and Sunraya are held by warlords who imitate the social structures of Yan Kor and Tsolyanu, respectively.

##### Milumanayani Names

Milumanayani introduce themselves by their tribal surname first, followed by their personal name and finally their mother or father’s name, whichever is more well known: e.g. Firaz Mmulavu Zhavendu (Mmulavu, son of Zhavendu, of tribe Firaz).

#### *M’mórchan*

The average M’morchan displays some traits of Mu’ugalavyani or Livyani ancestry, with somewhat flat facial features, coppery skin and wavy black hair.  The tribes of the Nmartusha jungle are much the same, but tend to have almond-shaped eyes, especially those that dwell near the city of Lost Bayarsha. M’morchans generally go nude, only feeling “dressed” after painting their bodies with their tribal colors. M’morchans are unpredictable, fearful of strangers, but also clever and curious (sometimes to their own detriment). 

M’morchan Names

The jungle dwellers of M'mórcha have no surnames but may append the name of their tribe to their names: e.g Dóri Koniláni (Dóri of the tribe of Koniláni).

#### *Mu’ugalavyáni*

The Mu’ugalavyáni and the peoples of the Chakas are short with golden tan skin and coarse black hair. They commonly have grey or lighter colored eyes and have somewhat flat faces and squarish jaws.  The Mu’ugalavyáni are seen as humourless blockheads, hopelessly stolid and unimaginative, set in their bureaucratic ways. However they are also known to be stiffly correct, honest, and ‘noble’.

Mu’ugalavyani Names

Mu’ugalavyáni names consist of two parts, a given name and one’s lineage.  It is customary to introduce oneself with your surname, followed by your given name.

**Mu’ugalavyáni Names:** (*male*) A'isénish, Cheku'unish, Do'onish, Hlaqórish, Ilanish, Ku'ulménish, Nishrásish, Sakkanish, Tutlámish, Vusomish; (*female*) Akurghá, Alyána, Ashinra, Hoguna, Karisa, Maya, Miluna, Qaigofsha, Sadal, Ssiriei

#### *Naqsái*

The Naqsai are a people found along the coastlines of the southern continent, they possess dark bronze skin, painted with black and turquoise in patterns specific to their tribes. They are broad-shouldered and robust people, but tending to stoutness with age.  Men and women alike shave their scalps or keep very little hair on their heads to better tolerate the heat of the homelands.

Naqsai Names: (female) Kama'ay

Rámetha Hélmu

#### *Nyémeseli*

The peoples of the Nymesel Isles are tall and lean, with golden-yellow skin like their Salarvyani neighbors across the sea.  Unlike the Salarvyani, they are not particularly hirsute people and are prone to premature baldness.  The Nyemeseli have a reputation for being exceedingly formal, soft and gentle, but become frighteningly wrathful when threatened. 

Nyemeseli Names

In the Nyemesel Isles a commoner is given only one name, often no more than the appellation of his or her profession: e.g . "Fisherman," "Cook;" "Potter," etc. The offspring of a priestly family are granted a long string of names: a "religious" title, a "public" name for everyday use, and a "secret" name to be employed during the rituals of the Goddess.

#### *N'lüss*

The N’lüss are tall and muscular, with bronze skin, brown hair and often hazel eyes.  They are the descendants of the Dragon Warriors, who very nearly conquered the world thousands of years ago.  The N’lüss still keep to the ancestral traditions of warfare, plunder and revenge.  They are seen as rowdy, pugnacious, and brutal, but honourable to a fault.

Names

N’luss have patronymic surnames, with *dvu* meaning “son of” and *dzu* meaning “daughter of”, N’luss nobility take the name of their band for surnames, appending it with the term *vag*, meaning “of the Band”.

**N'luss Names:** (*male*) Bekyén, Drgé, Hórga, Kendráya, Mirékh, Onürr, Pazhárr, Shémekh, Tréchka, Vrébo; (*female*) Beyén, Bnérr, Chirené, Chtésha, Dhia, G'yúdr, Mirruré, Maqáyhl, Nethé, Téija

**N’luss Bands.** Ashái, Bakál, Béqf, Drékka, Dyáq, Édu, Frshá, Grdrá, Jné, Khomán, Mnérr, Nirin-Hukh, Sroso, Tajnér, Tasnár, Tso’mác

#### *Nóm*

The Nóm have dark, almost black skin, with straight black hair and red-brown or golden eyes.  They are infrequently encountered in the Five Empires, so little known about their culture; but as befits a seafaring people, they are said to have the rigid social hierarchy of a crew at sea.  The Nom also have a reputation for being quarrelsome, but are quickly forgiving.  They have many strange taboos and superstitions, and are quite puritanical at following them.

Nom Names

How the Nom name themselves is a mystery, it is possible that those encountered thus far have only been members of a specific tribe, but this is just conjecture.  It is known that Nom magicians are called by the names of specific spells.

**Nóm Names.** Chári-Nóm, Dré-Nóm, Íbrq-Nóm, Jóhte-Nóm, Ká-Nóm, Myé-Nóm, Qrvát-Eóz, Róc-Nóm, Übyk-Nóm, Yé-Nóm

#### *Nuru’ún*

The Nuru’un are practically identical to the Chayakkuyani in appearance, but have significant linguistic, cultural and religious differences that bring them into frequent conflict with their sister tribe. They are known to be loyal to their friends, welcoming to visitors, but are quick to violence over slights to their pride.

Nuru’un Names

The peoples of the far northeast possess the personal name by that of the town or village in which they live: e.g . Miu Shigrazai (Miu of Shigraz).

#### *Pakálani*

The merchant-princes of Haida Pakala share ancestry with the Salarvyani, having pale golden skin, but are less hirsute and taller on average.  They are best described as ‘urbane robbers’, being materialistic, sophisticated, gregarious and often needlessly cruel.

Pakalani Names

Pakalani possess the personal name of the town or village in which they live: e.g . Vrikhán of Gorúlu.

#### *Pecháni*

The Pecháni are of the same stock as the Salarvyáni and have a similar culture, but typically disdain the petty squabbles their cousins are so often fond of.  They are known to be utterly fearless in battle, whose courage verges on foolhardiness, fond of harebrained schemes that beggar belief.  Pechani men possess splendid mustaches and their women voluminous tresses of night black hair. 

Pechani Names

Pecháni use the same names as the Salarvyáni, but are ruled by different gentries.  Kilalammuyani names are aslo common due to intermarriage with the mountain tribes.

**Pechani Lineages:** (*major*) Beneshchan, Rekhmel, Nradesu; (*minor*) Grillpa, Njano

#### *Pijénáni*

Pijéna shares ancestry with their Yán Koryani overlords, but they are less stocky by comparison.  By other nations' standards, the people of Pijéna are seen as weaklings, greedy, and untruthful.  But the Pijenani are also cunning, enterprising and pragmatic; viewing the more ‘honorable’ ways of others as a quick way to an early grave.

Pijenani Names

The Pijénani use the same names as the Yan Koryani and are matrilineal, using their mother’s lineage as a surname.

#### *Rannáluyáni*

The Five Empires consider the tribes of Rannalu to be savages; unfriendly, brusque and given to bursts of unreasonable anger. Rannaluyani generally have no regard for formality and become irritable when something cannot be done straightforwardly. They are short statured with strong, slender builds, wiry black hair and hard, sharp facial features.  

Rannaluyani Names

The nomads of Rannalu begin with the tribal name, then give the name of the individuals' mother, and end with the personal name, all in a long genitive construction: e.g . VurKhuzirJurshu ( Khuzi's (boy) Jurshu of (the tribe of) Vu).

#### *Saá Allaqíyáni*

Saá Allaqí is a neighbor of Yán Kor and is similar in culture and ancestry, but they are somewhat stockier.  The Sa’á Allaqiyáni have a long memory for history, their ancient blood feuds are legendary, but seldom is said of their penchant for never forgetting help freely given.  

Saa Allaqiyani Names

The Saá Allaqiyáni use the same names as the Yan Koryani and are matrilineal, using their mother’s lineage as a surname. They introduce themselves using their surname first, then their personal name.

#### *Salarvyáni*

The Salarvyáni have yellow-gold skin and dark, wavy hair.  They are an especially hirsute people, with the menfolk lovingly cultivating their beards.  The Salarvyáni are often regarded as feudal hotheads, who have nothing better to do than squabble over trifles, but they are known to be mischievous friends, jolly enemies, and generous patrons. 

Salarvyani Names

Salarvyáni names consist of two parts, a given name and one's lineage.  Salarvyá is ruled by seven major lineages, each ruling a feudal domain administered by dozens minor lineages.  

**Salarvyáni Names:** (*male*) Arjuggash, Balachyéshmu, Busétra, Chnesuru, Dreshshélmü, Gdéshmaru, Kúrru, Metállja, Tenggútla, Vindumákh; (*female*) Chgayar, Fayés, Greshtlá'úna, Jíchka, Menrin, Nráyen, Réshma, Tiqónmu, Tsagéshsha, Zéshsha

#### *Tané*

The Tane are tall, with golden-yellow complexions, wavy brown hair and almond-shaped eyes like the inhabitants of Lost Bayarsha.  They are primitive by the standards of the Five Empires and are known to show great bravado but be slow to violence.  The Tane are but one nation of a large subcontinent, who dwell among other peoples of shared ancestry.

Tane Names

The Tane are seldom encountered in the Five Empires, so it is unknown what sort of names they possess. 

#### *Tsoléini*

The Tsoléi archipelago lies off the shores of Livyanu and her peoples share a distant ancestry.  They have a reputation for being carefree, amiable, hospitable, and disorganised; they also are given to frequent acts of brutal piracy.

Tsoleini Names

Tsoléini personal names are very informal; children "grow into a name" and this may be changed by events during childhood or because of some salient personal characteristic (one occasionally meets Tsoléini who still retain their childhood nicknames). A Tsoléini changes their name whenever it seems appropriate, sometimes abandoning a name as "unlucky" and selecting another. The Tsoléini live communally and place greater importance on one’s residence, rather than simply family; e.g. Vru (formerly He-Who-Bites) of Red Rock House.

**Personal Names:** Alúo, Béi, Háka, Héle, Ka'o, Mí'a, Nsó, Ré, Síga, Vrú 

**Nicknames:** Bright Eyes, Crab-Catcher, Fishcakes, Good Morning, Hungry, Mudflat, Pearl-Diver, Sand Spider, Stowaway, Urchin

#### *Tsolyáni*

The Tsolyáni are slender with coppery brown skin and glossy black hair that hangs straight.  They have strong aquiline facial features and their men generally go beardless, not having much in the way of body hair.  Tsolyáni are seen as arrogant, officious, and overrefined, a nation always striving to live up to the unattainable standard of its Éngsvanyáli ancestors. However, the Tsolyani are famed for their dignity, energy, and adherence to their beliefs. 

Tsolyani Names

Tsolyani names consist of three parts, a given name, one’s lineage name (prefixed with "hi" meaning "of") and the name of one's clan (clans can be found in the Backgrounds section).

**Tsolyáni Names:** (*male*) Beshrügi, Dlékku, Eküne, Fíru, Girigámish, Hágarr, Jánash, Mirigdánu, Qútmu, Tluomé; (*female*) Ainé, Donátri, Fssúma, Ki'éna, Marisél, Odusúna, Tsolísha, Vajésh

**Tsolyáni Lineages:** hiAgnásh, hiArkóna, hiCháishmru, hiDíridan, hiFesrengála, hiGángasru, hiHkétoketl, hiKirutlár, hiLéroy, hiMáni, hiMriyén, hiPagárta, hiQadáryal, hiRadáika, hiSsánmirin, hiTelkólmü, hiUséna, hiVitlánme, hiWarúkka, hiZu'úggz	

#### *Yán Koryáni*

The Yán Koryáni are short and stocky with dark hair and dusky skin.  While the Yan Koryani cannot claim glorious ancestors, in this age they have proven themselves a people not to be trifled with.  They have a reputation of being rustic imitations of their southern betters, peripheral upstarts, and crude barbarians \- though they do have a reputation for courage and loyalty.

Yan Koryani Names

**Age**. The Humans of Tékumel live on average 45 years, some can live to be 70 or 80 years old.

**Size**. Humans on Tekumel commonly stand 5 to 5 ½ feet tall, some outliers, such as the N’luss peoples can be up to 7 feet tall.

**Languages**. You can speak, read, and write your native language, and two other languages of your choice.

## ***Moláiyal \- Nonhumans***

Though humans are the dominant species on the planet, there are several nonhuman states  and smaller enclaves scattered across the breadth of Tekumel.  The *Molaiyal* live in enclaves with environments reminiscent of their lost homeworlds; putrid swamps, dense jungles, frigid highlands, desolate wastes, and other territories uninhabitable to humans.  Those nonhumans that dwell in human society are commonly relegated to ghettos, where they are free to keep to their own ways.  Shenyu remains the largest independent nonhuman empire, the reptiles are normally quite insular, but few are willing to upset the balance of power by provoking them.  Across the eastern seas, the Ahoggya nation of Onmu tle Hlektis has only begun to make their presence known to the Five Empires.

### ***Friendly***

The friendly races generally enjoy human company, for good or for ill.  Some aspects of these sophonts mesh very well with human society and they often rise to prosperous, if not prominent positions therein.  They will accompany all sorts of companions, but are just as fearful of the inimical races as mankind.

#### *Hegléthyal* 

The Heglethyal are an amphibious race that prefer the swamplands of Tékumel, with their cultural homelands in the Puru ab Sharar Swamps of Mu’ugalavya, where they are known as the *A’láthish*.  The Swamp Folk are affable, if overly polite, and known to easily adopt new customs, integrating seamlessly into whatever communities they live within but quickly reverting to their own ways when amongst their own kind.  The Heglethyal commonly find employment in shipyards and docks, possessing knowledge of maritime trades; influencing  individuals are invited to join the major sailing and fishing clans, as they possess similar customs.  The Heglethyal are stalwart patriots of Mu’ugalavya, forming the backbone of their shipping trade and proudly serving in the navy of the Red-Caps. Though they possess an innate sensitivity to other-planar power, it is not a sensation they enjoy, as Swamp Folk sorcerers are virtually unheard of.  

##### The Swamp Folk

The Swamp Folk are roughly human-sized with pale rubbery skin, sometimes colored in pastel hues.  Their upper body is humanoid with two arms and a batrachian lower body with four legs, their heads have wide, almost human-like faces and a broad dorsal crest.  Like humans, they have two sexes, but  the differences between male and female are difficult to discern by outsiders.  Swamp Folk are typically monogamous and raise their children until they are of age and able to start their own families.  Though nominally patriarchal, Heglethyal society displays near-equality of the sexes, with certain tasks and roles performed by specific genders.   

Their settlements are built on stilts above the marsh, typically high enough to account for periodic flooding.  These villages have an eclectic, scattershot arrangement, with no roads or bridges to link their conical huts together, all travel is done by swimming or leather coracles.  There are no shops in small villages, all business is conducted from inside the home.  While they do not have inns or rest houses, the hospitality of the Swamp Folk is beyond reproach and they will house visitors for short stays at no cost.  Larger towns may have open areas for marketplaces and small shrines for local deities, but no grand temples.  

Their religious practices form much of their daily life, with dozens of minor rituals performed before eating, sleeping and leaving the house, strange gestures to ward off evil, taboo foods on certain days.  Each village has a priest called the “One Who Reminds Others'', who consults the populace on the correct ways to perform their duties.  Curiously, the Swamp Folk only worship their ancestral gods at home, but worship whatever local deities when among humans.

Swamp Folk communities are led by a council of respected families, who elect a First Speaker to be their liaison with the Mu’ugalavyáni authorities.  Heglethyal have little concept of personal property and thus find themselves in frequent disputes with their Mu’ugalavyáni neighbors over matters of theft and fishing rights.  They are not a particularly violent race, but they consider social infractions to be especially abhorrent, such as oath-breaking, dishonesty and breaches of etiquette.  The punishments for these transgressions is a severe tongue-lashing from their peers, which are highly effective deterrents against future incidents.  

Heglethyál Names

Swamp Folk don’t speak their language among outsiders, so they adopt fanciful nicknames when venturing with other Tekumelani.  This is probably for the best, since humans cannot pronounce their names anyways.

**Nicknames:** Purple Crest, Steel Fist, Gold Song, Red Mantle, Strong Bow, Great Stride, Second Beetle, Bronze Tongue, Stone Hand, Sight Blinder

#### *Ninínyal* 

*“To bargain with the Little Ones is to throw away one's purse”* **\-Tsolyáni saying**

Though small in stature, the courage of the Ninínyal is equal to twenty times their number in human soldiers.  They build sprawling subterranean burrow-cities in the northeastern plains of Yán Kor, where they are known as the *Nyéna*.  The Yán Koryáni have dwelt with the Nininyal for millenia and the Little Ones prosper under their rule.  The baronesses of Yán Kor customarily keep Nininyal mercenaries on retainer, where their natural sense of teamwork can be put to deadly effect.  It is said that no company of Ninínyal warriors has ever deserted a battle and they will fight to the very last.  

Nininyal commonly travel into human lands as part of trade caravans and have a reputation for being notorious swindlers, cheats and hagglers, but are still counted as friends to humanity. The Little Ones are seemingly always on the lookout for their next fortune and will often concoct elaborate schemes to gain a *kaitar*.  Ninínyal society is rife with violence, petty bickerings frequently erupt into vicious squabbles.  Their religious rites often involve sacrifices made by some sort of mob violence and they are fond of mocking cruelties. 

##### The Little Ones

*“To the deep hole with it\!”* **\-Nininyal exclamation**

The Nininyal are vaguely rodent-like beings, with sharp narrow faces, large round ears, rough black or brown fur and a vestigial tail.  The Little Ones, as they are called, only stand as high as a man’s waist and rival a dog in weight.  They have three sexes, about half of the Nininyal one encounters are male, hermaphrodites are the next most common sex, and female being the least common, but the most esteemed.  Nininyal culture is matriarchal, their warrens are ruled by an oligarchy of elder females called *Eh Mhur*, their cultural similarities to the humans of Yán Kor has ensured good relations for centuries.  

They are certainly capable of practicing magic, but seldom study sorcery unless it can be used to make money.

#### *Pé Chói*

*“But yet what a Pé Chói\! Instead of the sleek, dully-gleaming black nudity of the Pé Chói of Dó Cháka, this specimen was decked out in an oddly-fitting copy of a human’s kilt, a gorget of Chlén-hide, and—most ludicrous of all—a hat\! ...The Pé Chói minced forward on his two powerful rear legs, articulated tail swaying in unconscious imitation of a dandy’s walk.‘I am Chtik p’Qwe, Scholar Priest of the Fourth Circle.’ ”* **\-M.A.R. Barker, The Man of Gold**

The Pe Choi are the oldest allies of humanity, they enjoy the company of humans and even adopt human customs; indeed, some are even welcomed into human Clans.  One of the most interesting figures of the Golden Age was the chamberlain Ntés Ktík, who had become de-facto emperor of Engsvan hla Ganga, and is credited with keeping the empire together during the reign of the last so-called Inept Emperors of Antiquity. 

In temperament, Pe Choi are a genteel race, fond of ceremony and sophistication, though do not shy away from adventure when it calls.  They are stalwart friends and fearsome enemies, if overly prone to theatrics.  They are excellent fighters, despite their slight appearance and are savants when learning the ways of magic.

##### The Listeners

*“Man adapts and is happy; we Pé Chói remember—and are grieved.”* **\-Pe Choi proverb**

The Pe Choi are a delicate insectile race of forest-dwellers, possessing six multi-jointed limbs and a segmented tail.  Though they superficially resemble seahorses, they are poor swimmers, as they drown easily with their breathing apparatuses being upon their tails.  Pe Choi engaged in strenuous physical activity or distress will wag their tails vigorously, to increase airflow to their twin pairs of lungs, but this can exacerbate drowning in a panicking Pe Choi.

Male Pe Choi are jet black in coloration, while females are bone white; both sexes are able to adopt a dull grey “neuter” stage on a temporary or permanent basis, but it is not clear if the individual has a choice in the matter. There are also Pe Choi of reddish or greenish coloration, but it is unknown what these colors mean, if anything.

They have the faint acidic smell of a *dri*\-ant, a gathering of numerous Pe Choi will always smell like a glass of vinegar was split somewhere.  The translucent Hokun of the southeastern seas smell similarly by human discernment, but Pe Choi are profoundly disturbed by the scent.  The Hokun and the Pe Choi simply smell “wrong” to each other.  Humans smell like rotting meat to Pe Choi, a trait that they are willing to overlook for the sake of friendship.

All Pe Choi share a sort of instinctual psychic connection called “*Ntk-dqekt*”, which imparts a sense of “oneness” that makes intercine violence between Pe Choi rare, yet also a profound incompleteness, a yearning for something that can never be attained, or even named.  The “wild” Pe Choi of the Chakas believe this loneliness will be cured only in the afterlife, within the Eternal Forests of Hh-kk-ssa, possibly an ancestral memory of their lost homeworld.

The center of Pe Choi society lies within the forests of the Chakas, with villages hidden amidst the woods.  They primarily serve the Imperium of Tsolyánu, but those communities that lie closer to the border favor Mu’ugalavya.  They worship their own gods, one called the Father of Nests, who aligns to the Lords of Stability, the other called the Black Old One, who aligns to the Lords of Change.  Though they can be overly refined in most facets of life, Pe Choi funerals are the exception, they dig small graves outside their settlements and lay their dead to rest with little ceremony.

##### Pé Chói Names

Pe Choi have multiple names throughout their childhood, given to them by their family with each molting of their exoskeleton. After their adult moulting, a Pé Chói chooses new names for their adult selves.  These are often dramatic and somewhat fanciful.  For example, Tk-étk-dsá translates to “Green-Timber-Like-Warrior”, they sometimes employ these translations in lieu of their true pronunciations. 

**Names**: Ákht-Nú-Ó (Red-of-Thoughts), C'hk'ehl (Forest-Runner), Chk-Ptk-Kk (Knows-Medicine), Itk t'Sa (He-of-Many-Deaths), Mékw-Tí (Handsome-One), Nípw-Pétk (Bitter-as-a-Berry), Ptch-tik-ne (Laughs-Like-the-Owl), Pték Ktík (Sings-Like-a-Bird), Tk-étk-dsá (Green-Timber-Like-Warrior), Tná-Chú (She-of-the-Swords)

##### Pé Chói Traits

**Ability Score Increase**. Your Dexterity score increases by 2\. Your Charisma score increases by 1\.

**Age**. Although the Pé Chói reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, they only live a fraction as long, about 30 years on average.  Though a few individuals do live up to 60 \- 70 years of age.

**Alignment**. The Pé Chói have a strong sense of justice and will fearlessly pursue those that have wronged them.  As such, they tend towards the lawful Alignments.

**Size**. Pé Chói are anywhere from 5 to 7 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.

**Speed**. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

**Psychic Sensitivity.** Pé Chói can sense the presence (but not location) of other creatures within a 30 foot radius.

**Keen Senses.** You have proficiency in your Perception skill.

**Multiple Limbs**. The Pé Chói have four arms and while they cannot make extra actions, they can hold other weapons or objects in their extra hands and use these alternately.

**Languages**. You can speak, read, and write Pé Chói and another language of your choice.  The Pé Chói language is difficult, but not impossible for humans to reproduce, as it is a series of clicking, whistling and hooting supplemented by complex hand gestures meant for beings with four limbs.  Many of its words and phrases possess multiple meanings and are only understood within the context of which they are spoken.  There are six known dialects of Pe Choi, three are extinct, two are spoken in Tsolyanu and one in Mu’ugalavya.  

**Sub-races.** You can choose between two different kinds of Pe Choi.

*Tame Pe Choi (“Té-Mté”)*

*“Can the mountain know of the diamond in its heart?”* **\-Tku Pnii, Pé Chói scholar**

*Meaning “Copy-Brothers” in Pe Choi, the Te-Mte are most commonly encountered in human lands.  They are cultural chameleons, eager to adopt the customs of their human neighbors and integrate easily into society.*

*Ability Score Increase*

*Wild Pe Choi (“Ntu-ntik”)*

*“Born under the trees.”* **Pé Chói saying**

*Meaning “the People” in their language, the Ntu-ntik are those who keep to the forests of Do Chaka and practice the ancestral ways.  These “Wild” Pe Choi that dwell near the hidden city of Hrika tend to be exceedingly matriarchal, with a solitary female serving as “Village Mother” attended to by a harem of influential males, all other females adopting the neuter stage in deference to the matriarch.*

*Curiously, the Wild Pe Choi exhibit different coloration, males being greenish-black, while females are reddish in color.*

*Ability Score Increase*

#### *Tinalíya* 

If any sophont has the potential to reinvigorate Tekumel’s waning technological development, it is the Tinaliya.  They are intensely curious, highly intelligent and value education, but their minds are ill-suited for metaphorical thought and are disturbingly literal-minded.  The Gnomes, as they are sometimes called, cannot comprehend figures of speech and they have absolutely no sense of humor.  They are highly orderly and naturally inclined towards community, but paradoxically have little concept of law.  One would think the highly rigid religious hierarchies of Livyanu would be the ideal place for them, but the Tinaliya and the overlords of Tsamra only just tolerate each other.  The Tinalíya serve in the Livyáni armies, but their service is borne entirely out of pragmatic concerns rather than any sense of patriotism.

##### The Gnomes

The Tinalíya are diminutive insectile creatures, scarcely more than a few feet tall.  They make their subterranean colonies in the foothills of mountains across the planet, but their largest colony in the Five Empires is the enclave of Tkit Tlinet Ses Ti, built into Tlasthe Heights, a low mountain range within Livyanu.  Tinaliya have somewhat conical heads mounted atop a roundish body covered in a chitinous carapace, surrounded by six bulbous, segmented limbs each with three slender manipulators.  They have three sexes; male-drones, female-workers and the multitudinous neuter-warriors.

The Tinalíya are curiously monotheistic, worshipping a distant god with no interest in the world.  They acknowledge the powers of Lords of Change and Stability, but typically ignore all other gods save for Dra, the Uncaring.  They place their dead neuter-warriors in chambers where the Tinalya cultivate their staple fungus food, while male-drones and female-workers are entombed in deep catacombs with some possessions from life.

They are excellent magicians and surprisingly effective warriors, having no concept of a “fair fight”, in battle they can and will use all options available to them, even if it is not “honorable”.

Tinalíya Names

Tinalíya names are entirely functional, providing a literal descriptor of the individual; often including their sex, any prominent physical traits and their home. Tí Sá Qó translates directly to “Neuter-Warrior Dark-Speckled-One-of-the-Place-of Qó”

**Names**: Tí Sá Qó (Neuter-Warrior Dark-Speckled-One-of-the-Place-of Qó), Chikattag (Big-Bulbous-Forelimbs), Pa'l'Ti (This-One), Ti Ro Lo (Neuter-Warrior One-Eyed-One-of-the-Place-of-Lo), K'kes (Large-Child), Chni T'kop (Call-Me-What-You-Like), Ettó Ká-Tésh (Female-Worker Late of-Ka), K'nés (Wise), Si Ang Te (Male-Drone White-Bellied-One-of-the-Place-of-Te), Ti Kaa Li Li (Big-Stupid-One)

##### Tinalíya Traits

**Ability Score Increase**. Your Intelligence score increases by 2

**Age**. Tinalíya mature similarly to humans, they live about 45 years on average.

**Alignment**. While tinalíya have orderly societies, they have absolutely no concept of law.  This paradox makes it so they favor neutral alignments.

**Size**. The average tinalíya stands about 3 to 3½ feet tall and weighs 80 to 120 pounds. Your size is Small.

**Speed**. Your base walking speed is 25 feet.

**Gnome Cunning**. You have advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic.

**Artificer's Lore.** Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to magic items, alchemical objects, or technological devices, you can add twice your proficiency bonus, instead of any proficiency bonus you normally apply.

**Quadrupedal Build**. You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push or drag.  In addition, you have advantage against checks and saves that would make you prone.

**Languages**. You can speak, read, and write Tinalíya, Livyáni, and one other language of your choice.  Their language sounds like bubbling and popping. Tinalíya is impossible for humans to speak and is actually three tongues woven together, one for males, females and neuter-warriors.

### ***Neutral***

The neutral races have had thousands of years of history with humanity, and they are not impressed.  Though they seldom have reason to hate humans outright, these sophonts prefer to keep to themselves and avoid interaction with others unless necessity demands it.  On occasion, their number can be found in the company of the inimical races, but such relationships are thought to be brief affairs.

#### *Ahoggyá* 

*“The head of an enemy is a joy for one's descendants.”* **\-Ahoggyá saying**

The Ahoggya are relative newcomers to the Five Empires, only settling the coasts of Salarvya sometime after the fall of Engsvan hla Ganga.  Most find them to be particularly unpleasant to be around, they are lacking in social graces, being blunt to the point of rude and considered slovenly by any standard.  The Knobbled Ones, as they are sometimes called, can be found in any of the swamplands of Tekumel, but their greatest strongholds are the Sharuna Lowlands of Salarvya, the Flats of Gyogma in Haida Pakala and the distant Ahoggya nation of Onmu tle Hlektis.  Their swamp villages are unwelcoming to visitors and those that venture forth into the world commonly find employment in unsavory trades.  

##### The Knobbled Ones

*“As hateful as the smoke of an Ahoggyá cooking fire.”* \-**Shén saying**

The Ahoggya are squat creatures with barrel-like bodies covered in bristly fur and knobbled skin.  They have four hooked arms and four bowed legs, spread equidistant around a mushroom-like dome of hardened skin and bony lumps.  Their braincases are situated in the center of their bodies, surrounded by eight eyes arranged in pairs on four sides, one possesses a mouth just below the eyes, while the other sides have the remaining sensory organs.  The Ahoggya are also said to possess eight sexes, but they do not elaborate on their reproductive habits.  

The Ahoggya are enthusiastic omnivores, with a taste for rotten fare, it is difficult to say which is worse, their table manners or their breath\!  Tomb-guards keep a close eye on any Ahoggya that come into town, lest they be found plundering the catacombs for supper.  This taste for decay has brought them into disfavor with the Shen, who have never forgiven the Knobbled Ones for eating fallen mercenaries during an ill-fated expedition into Salarvya. Curiously, the Ahoggya will not eat their own dead and have absolutely no stomach for liquor, even the weakest of wines will set their bowels quivering and ruin the day of a housekeeping slave.  Their most curious vice they seem to have is a fondness for copper, forever praising its effect on their health.

The Ahoggya from the lands of Onmu tle Hlektis stand apart from their cousins on the mainland.  Though certainly given to typical Ahoggya repugnance, they are considerably more sophisticated in culture, having an elaborate political structure ruled by a figure called “the Loudest Grumbler.” Other officials populate the political landscape of this alien nation, councils of magistrates, military commanders who bear copper bands riveted into their carapaces and record-keepers that track their accounts by means of a series of knots tied into cords.

Settlements in Salarvya and Haida Pakala seem to be ruled by a figure whose unpronounceable title loosely translates to “Beloved of All Eight Sexes”, whatever this means is unknown.  Another important figure in Ahoggya society is known as the *P’chn* (Dance Master or Dancer in the Circle), an hereditary socio-religious position.

Though certainly capable of practicing magic, the Ahoggya have little interest in sorcery and even less in religion.  Though they acknowledge the power of the gods, they do not worship them, they do not seem to worship any form of gods or spirits or ancestors at all.  They only corpses they will not eat are their own, they simply toss their dead into the refuse pits outside theri swamp hovels.

Ahoggyá Names

Ahoggyá names sound like sewage gurgling down a drain, as goes the common jest.  But this is not far from the truth, the Ahoggyá language is unpronounceable by humans and no respectable scholar would devote their skein of destiny towards such a feat.  Ahoggyá themselves are seldom eager teachers and commonly adopt nicknames when traveling abroad.

**Nicknames**: Red-Eye, Old White Side, Gurgle, Dung for Brains, Crab Barrel, Stumpy, Mud Bucket, Gnarled One, Yellow Splotched One, Flies, Leatherback

##### Ahoggyá Traits

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Strength score increases by 2 and your Constitution score increases by 2\.

**Age.** Ahoggyá mature and live similarly as long as humans do, they live about 45 years on average.

**Alignment**. Most Ahoggyá are Neutral, they behave according to their own alien customs and ignore those of other races.

**Size.** An Ahoggyá stands between 4 ½ to 5 feet and 2 ½ feet in diameter. Your size is Medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor.

**All-Around Vision.** With a pair of eyes on every side of your barrel-like body, you cannot be snuck upon unless by a hidden opponent.  

**Poison Resilience.** You have advantage on Saving Throws against poison, and you have Resistance against poison damage.

**Psychic Dampener.** You have advantage on Saving Throws against illusions and against being charmed or paralyzed.

**Multiple Arms.** The Ahoggyá have four arms and while they cannot make extra actions, they can hold other weapons or objects in their extra hands and use these alternately.

**Quadrupedal Build**. You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push or drag.  In addition, you have advantage against checks and saves that would make you prone.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Ahoggyá and one other language of your choice. Ahoggyá is a language that is more spat out than spoken, full of hard consonants and guttural sounds. It has no written component, rather, it is tied into cords, with the size of the knots and their proximity to each other convery meaning.

###### 

#### *Hláka* 

Many epics sing of Hlaka that dispense wisdom that belies their simple nature, but such high praise seems fantastical when one has kept the company of one.  To many, Hlaka are flighty, easily frightened and mischievous, but charming in their own way.  Even the horrid Ssu and Hluss find them to be easy friends, provided they are not in the company of humans.  The Hlaka have no allegiance to any human nation, due as much to the remoteness of their settlements as their flighty nature.  They are somewhat scatterbrained and have difficulty with mathematics (they typically count with their fingers, though the clever ones use their toes as well).  Despite these examples, Hlaka are often smarter than they seem, but at times it suits them to play the fool.

##### The Furred Flyers

The Hlaka are slender, simian-like creatures with large leathery wings and a sinuous tail with a stinger.  They have three bright blue eyes set under a heavy brow ridge and long, flat beast-like heads.  Their fur is commonly brown, but black, red and golden colors are not unusual.  The Furred Flyers make their homes on mountain top eyries across Tekumel, but their largest communities lie in Kilalammu.

Built into mountainside caverns, Hlaka eyrie-cities are welcoming locales, if one can get there.  The entrances are communal areas, where food is cooked, guests are enthusiastically welcomed and enemies enthusiastically harassed.  The young and vulnerable are kept in chambers carved into the innermost caverns.  The social and religious customs of the Furred Flyers are overseen by a hereditary king called an “*Aoi Ela*”.  He is customarily given the first share of the deceased during funerary feasts, but may honor non-Hlaka guests by passing his portion to them. 

Hlaka religion seemingly consists of a series of rituals that involve arranging colored stones in geometric patterns atop flat mountains at astronomically significant times.  They are curious about the faiths of others and often accompany their companions to religious rituals, even if they find the somber formalities to be amusing.

Hláka Names

Hlaka names are whimsical and sometimes melodious, for example Iwáu Ae-ayá  means “One Whose Flight is Higher than the Sun”.

**Names**: Chráò Eyúo Máíi (Watches Boats on the Sea), Dzá Uyó-Eyóa (She Who Thinks Deeply About Things), Ekk-saa (Eyes Like a Moon), Ewo-i-iya (Swift as Kuni-Falcon), Hái-hai (Rocks Fall), Iwáu Ae-ayá (One Whose Flight is Higher than the Sun), La-li-lu-le-lo (Brings Tears to the Rain), Ri-i-i-ek (Eyes Catch the Shine), Ssaeó Aó-Miú (Catches Thunder in His Jaws), Súa-eyá (Dances Among the Clouds)

**Tail Stinger**. The Hlaka are proficient in using their tails to make unarmed strikes, which deal 1d4 \+ Dexterity modifier in piercing damage on a hit.

**Prehensile Tail**. You can grasp things with your tail. lt has a reach of 5 feet, and it can lift a number of pounds equal to your Strength score. You can use it to do the following simple tasks: lift, drop, hold, push, or pull an object or a creature; open or close a door or a container; grapple someone; or make an unarmed strike.

#### *Páchi Léi* 

*“They were pear-shaped, soft-skinned beings, greyish-green in hue, a hand taller than a man, with four curiously articulated lower limbs for locomotion and four more, longer upper limbs for swinging in the trees of the forests of the Pán Chákan Protectorate ... \[they\] wore little more than cross-belts of untanned hide, and their leader carried a short, thick spear tipped with a barb of white bone. Harsan stared at them, and they stared back from round, platter-sized eyes, greeting him pleasantly enough in oddly accented Tsolyáni and chattering amongst themselves in their own burbling tongue.”* **\-M.A.R. Barker, The Man of Gold**

The inhabitants of Pan Chaka often claim that the Pachi Lei are “better than humans”, they are a gentle and generous race, who exemplify the sort of community every clan aspires to be.  During the conquest of the Chakas, the Pachi Lei supported Tsolyanu, eager to cast away their hated Mu’ugalavyani overlords. Though the Tree Lords were forced to cede power to God-Emperor, they now swear sovereignty to the Petal Throne.  In recognition of their valuable assistance, imperium is content to allow them a modicum of autonomy, as the soaring forests of *Ezbal* trees the Pachi Lei call home are ill-suited for human settlers.

##### The Forest Dwellers

The Pachi Lei have lumpy, green-grey bodies and eight limbs, four strong arms and four strong legs.  Their faces are flat and beast-like, with large saucer-like eyes and their heads crowned with fibrous, leafy growths. They have little concept of parenthood, as children are raised communally.  Pachi Lei are hermaphroditic, every four years releasing spores into the air, which fertilize the egg-buds of others and produce an infant about eight months later.  Excess children are often bartered away to other families in need of new members. 

The Pachi Lei live together in small groups called Households, which often trade members, with a short “marriage” ceremony used to welcome the newcomer.  They are highly social, each seeing themselves primarily as part of a community.  They typically have little in the way of outright individuality, but those that do commonly go out to explore both the world and themselves. 

Pan Chaka forests they call home lie within the borders of Tsolyánu and they are faithful patriots.  They are passionate in their hatred for Mu’ugalavyá, as they have never forgiven the great massacres the Palaces of the Square inflicted upon them centuries ago.  The Forest Dwellers have a comparable level of violence and theft to humans, but have a system of reparative justice.  Thieves must surrender stolen articles but also another item of equal value, while murderers are exiled and slowly perish from the crushing solitude.  The threat of *Biruyh* lies within the heart of every Pachi Lei, at any time they may fly into violent madness, attacking and killing anything in sight.  Within their own communities, Pachi Lei forgive these outbursts, the moment never spoken of again.

The Pachi Lei worship twin gods; N’rg is a god of radiance and wisdom & its counterpart A’lsh is a god of darkness and secrets.  The Pachi Lei are practitioners of sky burials, they tie their dead to the branches of sacred trees for birds to feed upon.

Páchi Léi Names

The Páchi Léi are highly communal creatures, each one sees themselves as part of a greater whole, so they have little use for individual names.  Instead they identify themselves with the place they live with their family.  For example, Ffsá Brúgshmü means “One-of-the-Upper-House High-Bole-Tree”.

**Names:** Ffsá Brúgshmü (One-of-the-Upper-House High-Bole-Tree), Buach-Ikwá-Ung (Member-of-Burnt-but-Green-Stump), Vroggá Dzh-Urrú (),G-Gum-Shoggu, Hózzy G'ddzár, Írwesh, Kwo-Hü-Kú'o, Mkhóqu O-Myess,Vrog-n'gha, Yélyo Bzü'ürh (Broken-Trunk-Manse-Master)

**Speed**. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. You also have a climbing speed of 30 feet as long as you are not encumbered or wearing heavy armor.

**Darkvision**. The Páchi Léi are accustomed to life within dim forests. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

**Forest Dweller**. You have proficiency in the Nature and Acrobatics skills.  In addition, you have advantage on stealth checks in forested environments.

**Multiple Arms**. The Páchi Léi have four arms and while they cannot make extra actions, they can hold other weapons or objects in their extra hands and use these alternately.

**Languages**. You can speak, read, and write Páchi Léi, Tsolyánu and one other language of your choice. Pachi Lei is a throaty, gurgling language, their voices meant to carry softly through the ancient forests of their long-lost homeworld. Humans can only speak rudimentary Pachi Lei, many of its subtleties are unable to be replicated by human tongues.

#### *Shén* 

*“The sixth member of the group was a nonhuman, a hulking reptilian Shén, native to the hot lands south of Livyánu, half a continent away. He traded in the flame opals of Pán Cháka and in garnets, commodities which the Shén knew were valued by humans and other species, but which they themselves held in no particular esteem. Although the Shén was friendly enough, his guttural name was unpronounceable—something between a hiss and a snarl.”* **\-M.A.R. Barker, The Man of Gold**

Powerfully built and possessing strong martial traditions, the Shen are known as “demon warriors” within the Five Empires, highly sought after as mercenaries and bodyguards.  They generally dislike delicacy and over-refinement, possibly due to their large size and clumsy nature.  The strength of Shenyu is enough to rival any one of the Five Empires, but the Shen are particularly insular and are uninterested in the affairs of human nations.  Their neutrality has kept them on nominally good terms with their Livyáni neighbors to the north.

##### The Demon Warriors

The Shen are large, bipedal reptilian creatures with black scales and toothy beaks.  Their heads have an extendable frilled crest, often decorated with bright paints. Their tails end in a hard club-like knob, used liberally in combat. The Shen commonly paint their scales in iridescent colors, though those with naturally blue-black scales are considered great beauties of their kind.  Though they can tolerate the cold, they prefer to keep to the hot climate of Tékumel’s southern regions, but individuals commonly venture northward as adventurers or mercenaries.

The Shen have three sexes, the egg-producers, the egg-layers, and the egg-fertilizers.  The specifics of Shen reproduction are byzantine affairs akin to clans arranging a marriage, with egg-groups petitioning others for the patronage of their egg-fertilizers.  In general, the Shen tend to defer to the largest members of their kind, which are typically the egg-producers, who seem to drive most of the institutions of Shen society.  Shen are somewhat monogamous, with egg-producers and egg-layers forming long-term pair bonds, but inviting an egg-fertilizer to join the family on a semi-permanent basis.

The center of Shen society is that of the egg-group, extended families similar to human clans, but instead related to a lineage of egg-fertilizers.  Different egg-groups instinctively react to others in different ways, some as allies and others as mortal enemies.  Every competent strategist knows well enough to keep Shen regiments separated, to prevent unnecessary altercations on and off the battlefield. The Shen once cultivated an herb that suppressed their animosity to another when chewed, but all crops were lost in a great blight thousands of years ago.

It is rare for Shen and Ahoggya to be friends, ever since word spread of the Ahoggya’s fondness for stewed Shen meat.   Though the Great War is long past, Shen blood runs deep with grudges, they may not attack Ahoggya on sight, but there is certainly no love lost.

Shen religion is polythesitic, with hundreds of gods to embody the elements, deities of fire and blood, air and storm, but their two foremost gods are called “the One of Eggs” and “the One Who Rends”

They store the bones of their dead in large clay urns, typically kept within a family tomb.

Shen communities are governed by councils called *Hrg-Ssa*, centred around a dominant egg-group and their allied egg-groups, sometimes including neutral egg-groups.  There are many different calibres of Hrg-Ssa, but the supreme council meets in Ssorva, to debate matters of state for Shenyu.  

The Shen have little love for their children until they learn to speak, before then they are regarded somewhere in between a pet and a pest, those that make themselves a nuisance quickly find their way into a stewpot.  On occasion, hatchlings will be born that simply do not “smell right” to their parents, most of these are eaten on sight, but those that escape may be adopted by another egg-group or go on to found a wholly new egg-group, if there are enough survivors of their clutch.

They can eat most human foods without issue, but cannot stomach any sort of liquor, even the smallest drop of a spirit.

Shén Names

Shén names consist of a personal name, appended by the name of one’s egg-group. For example, Mrgág Ss-shrsá is literally Mrgág of the egg-group Ss-shrsá. The separation of these two elements can be difficult for human ears to perceive.

**Names**: À-Shg, Grr, Gunga, Gug, Hú, J'grék, K'chár, M'í, Mrgág, Shá-Kn, Tŕ

**Egg-Group Names:** (*major*) Gai, Gopuri, Khakh, Mmatugual, Ngua, Qonu, Ra, Ssorva, Shrukhe'el; (*minor*) Bardush Hru, Boch'un, Chri, Dlei, Hruggash, Kheng, Mmasht, Qeleqmu, Shuggar, Vicheb, Yro

**Languages**. You can speak, read, and write Shen, and two other languages of your choice.  Shen is a highly sibilant tongue, punctuated with throaty growling and muttering, there are several dialects spoken by different egg-groups.  Humans lack the ability to hear some of the words and cannot make such noises at all.

### ***Inimical***

The inimical races hate humanity utterly, their myths and histories abound with the multitudes of crimes mankind has inflicted upon them.  They rejoice in the misfortunes of their eternal foes and even races friendly with humanity are not safe from their depredations.  It must be said that the inimical races are not allies and have their own conflicts between each other.

#### *Hlutrgú* 

The Hlutrgu are a race of hateful little amphibians that dwell in the isolated bogs along Msumtel Bay, from Layodu Swamps of the Kaija Protectorate to the Shikel Swamps of Salarvya.  They are constant threats to nearby villages and local shipping, as hordes of the Hlutrgu pour out of the swamps with little warning.  The Tsolyani have attempted multiple expeditions to exterminate the Swamp Frogs, but few warriors are desperate or foolhardy enough to die ignobly in the mud or worse yet, be taken prisoner by Hlutrgu and suffer tortures too horrid to name. 

##### The Swamp Frogs

The Hlutrgu are vaguely humanoid, with tough, rubbery skin and rotund bodies and each of their spindly limbs having a six-fingered hand.  Their heads are skull-like, with wide mouths filled with dozens of needle-sharp fangs.  They are mottled greenish, greyish or blackish in colour, and are somewhat shorter than humans on average.  The overwhelming majority of Hlutrgu are males, with a small female population and the tiny number of hermaphrodites whose rule is the only law these anarchic beings recognize.

The Hlutrgu are prolific breeders and rather than suffer the plights of overpopulation, they cast their surplus offspring out to found new colonies, forming small flotillas of rafts that range up and down the coasts; raiding human settlements, attacking ships or becoming food for sea monsters.

The neuter caste of the Hlutrgu would seem to serve some sort of important socio-religious role, they are perfect hermaphrodites, capable of asexual reproduction and are worshipped as semi-divine beings by their fellows.

	Hlutrgu Names

The Hlutrgu do not introduce themselves to their captives.  But they identify themselves with their particular nest-village.

#### *Hlüss* 

The insectoid Hluss are one of the autochthonous inhabitants of Tekumel, while the Ssu kept to their inland kingdoms, the Hluss ruled the coastlines and were masters of the seas.  Their nest-ships can be found prowling every ocean, emitting a hideous droning that can be heard for miles.  Only the desperate or foolhardy go looking to encounter a nest-ship, all others quickly steer their ships away.  They are most dangerous near their island strongholds of Hlussayal and Ssru Gatl, where the supreme queen-mothers are said to dwell.  Little is known about their society, but prisoners taken aboard nest-ships report that Hluss are greedy for treasure and exceptionally so for any bit of power.  

The Hluss are cheerfully inquisitive, obsessed with aesthetics and fond of ornamentation, often fastening gemstones to their exoskeletons in exquisite patterns using a cement-like secretion.  Sometimes they find ancient technology and will secure it to an advantageous position for expeditious use.

##### Spawn of the Old Ones

The Spawn of the Old Ones, as they are sometimes called, are scorpion-like in appearance, with greenish-blue to beetle-black segmented exoskeletons and a flexible tail equipped with a poisonous stinger.  They have six limbs, a pair of small arms and four long legs, they can only stand on their rearmost legs for short moments, typically to rend and grasp enemies with their middle limbs.  Their broad, flattish heads have three eyes arranged in a forward-facing row, a sharp proboscis and razor-like mandibles.

Each Hluss is born knowing its place in the social order, each community and nest-ship is ruled by a queen-mother or her daughter, who is attended by a coterie of male advisors and served by a small army of neuters who each have their own inborn roles.  Some neuters are born warriors, others become sorcerer-scholars and there are various castes of artisans and laborers that maintain the nest.  

They are not particularly numerous, but they sometimes raid coastal settlements to capture new slave-incubators.  The Hluss use their stingers to paralyze their captives and bring them to their queen-mother, who implants their still-living bodies with a wicked ovipositor.  The eggs hatch about four months later, an excruciating death for any unfortunate soul.  The body is then sent to the larder for future meals, as the Hluss prefer the taste of meat seasoned with agony.

A form of ancestor worship is prevalent among the Hluss, who feed their dead to the queen-mothers, a symbolic returning of the essence to the source.  When a female dies, she is encased in a membranous sac and stored in sacred chambers for the veneration of future queens.  

Hluss Names

The Hluss rarely introduce themselves when they raid coastal settlements.  Any names they may have can only be speculated.

##### Hlüss Traits

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and another ability score of your choice increases by 1\.

**Age.** Hluss mature quickly and can live to be around 90 years old.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet and you have a swimming speed of 30 feet.

**Hold Breath.** You can hold your breath for up to 15 minutes at a time.

**Odour.** You have a distinctive sweetish-acidic odour.  You have disadvantage on attempts to avoid detection by scent. Victims of Hluss raids must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you until the end of your next turn

**Quadrupedal Build**. You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push or drag.  In addition, you have advantage against checks and saves that would make you prone.

**Grappling Appendages.** You can rear up and attack foes with the claws on your middle pair of limbs. As an action, you can use one of them to grapple a creature. Each one is also a natural weapon, which you can use to make an unarmed strike with. If you hit, they do 1D6 \+ your strength modifier bludgeon damage. Immediately after hitting, you can try to grapple the target as a bonus action. These appendages are not dexterous enough to use weapons, magic weapons, and other specialized equipment.

**Carapace.** Your skin in places is covered by a thick shell. You gain a \+1 to your AC when not wearing heavy armour.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Hluss and another language of your choice.

#### *Ssú* 

*“Four wide-spraddled legs extended out from the twisted column of the torso ... The head was oval, the face only vaguely human; there were two eyes, round and black-gleaming, and nostril slits but no nose. The mouth consisted of a vertical ellipse. It was the thing’s skin that was the most repellent: it resembled mottled gray parchment peeling from a roll, the ends loose and ragged, very much like the winding sheet of a corpse long in the grave.”* **\-M.A.R. Barker, Flamesong**

The Ssu and their cousins, the Hluss, are the true masters of Tékumel.  They had just begun to explore their home system when humanity invaded and reduced this proud race to prisoners upon their own world.  The theft of a glorious destiny is burned into the racial memory of the Ssu, forever they will hate the aliens that took what was their rightful theirs.  The Enemies of Man are an industrious people, highly pragmatic with little interest in the artistic diversions of the Hluss.  They are greatly feared for the brutality of their raids, those they dont slay outright they enslave in their cavern-cities deep below the surface of the world.  That said, the Ssu are not uniformly hostile to humanity and the other sophonts of Tekumel, being especially fond of the Hlaka.  The small feudal nation of Pechano has frequently engaged in peaceful interactions with their historical foes, traditionally the king of Ssuyal is invited to royal weddings and a seat of honor reserved should they attend.  Adventurers returning from voyages on the subterranean tubeway network describe a distant land where humans, Shen and Ssu coexist together.

##### The Enemies of Man

The Ssu are somewhat humanoid, with an roundish head set above a pair of shoulders on a narrow abdomen, but have four legs extending equidistantly from their hips.  Each of their limbs ends in three opposable digits, which can be used to manipulate objects.  Their heads have two large black eyes, nostril slits and an ovoid mouth.  Instead of skin, their bodies are covered in a paper-like integument, the loose ends of which frequently tear off, giving the Ssu the superficial appearance of a corpse in tattered funeral wrappings.  They are commonly of a mottled grey coloration, but there have been reports of those with reddish, greenish or bluish tones.

Similar to the Hluss, the vast majority of Ssu are neuter “worker-fighters”, bred to suit various roles in their society.  However, Ssu communities are led by a small fraternity of their males, while their miniscule female population are kept in luxury, they have little actual say in Ssu society.  Some enclaves have a more sophisticated political structure, with a king attended by elaborately costumed generals, scholars, artisans and serfs, much like the courts of human lands.

Ssu communities lie deep below ground, within vast cavern-cities connected to Underworlds or to the ancient tubeway system.  Though they can see well in the dark, they also prefer a dim bluish light, adventurers would do well to avoid passages in the Underworld set with twinkling blue lanterns.  Settlements within Ssuyal have surface entrances marked by triangular stone pyramids with a single sliding door of their western face.

Virtually nothing is known about what gods the Enemies of Man worship, but it is certain they must abhor humanity as much as the Ssu.  Presumably they would favor the Lords of Change, as they are eager to reverse their fortunes and would certainly enjoy overturning the current state of the world.  

	Ssu Names

The Ssu seldom introduce themselves when raiding the surface, so little is known of their naming customs.  The names given below are taken from Pechani historical records, which details the names of the entourage of Chnur, king of the Grey Ssu, who attended the wedding of the hero Serqu to princess Alitle of Pechno.

Bassa, Chnur

#### *Vléshgayal* 

*“Ugly enough to arouse the passions of a Shunned One.”* **\-Tsolyáni idiom**

The Vleshgayal seldom venture from their domed cities in the northern frontiers of Yan Kor.  They are most commonly encountered below ground, where they quest for magical artifacts and the super-technologies of the Great Ancients.  The Shunned Ones, as they are commonly known, can rapidly transverse Tekumel by means of the prehistoric tube way system.  The Vleshgayal are phenomenal sorcerers and exceedingly intelligent, it is said they are able to repair the incredible little devices known as “Eyes” and perhaps be able to construct them.  They are furtive beings and take great steps to avoid contact with humanity, all the while pouring their considerable intellect into their destruction.

##### The Shunned Ones

The Shunned Ones are tall, gangly humanoids whose rugose skin resembles that of rotting fruit.  They clothe themselves from head to toe in voluminous robes, leaving only their hideous faces bare.  Their heads are large and bulbous, the only recognizable facial features being two black unblinking eyes, their mouths hidden between folds of wrinkles at the base of their throat.  Specimens obtained by the College of the Enemy in Pechano have revealed the Shunned Ones have at least five sexes or perhaps different stages of a single one.

The trait they are most known for is their incredible stench, the odour of a Vleshgayal is felt more than it is breathed, assaulting all the senses with indescribable violence.  The presence of a Shunned One can be detected by smell from a considerable distance, even when they are downwind.  Curiously, this odour cannot be detected just outside their domed cities, as they are masterfully engineered, hermetically sealed from the elements in ways not unlike the near-perfect architecture of ever-glorious Engsvan hla Ganga.  The thin, yellowish air within burns the lungs, invaders are sapped of their lives and die in little over an hour.

Seniority in Vleshgayal society seems to be linked with one’s proficiency with sorcery.  Underworld adventurers report Shunned Ones deferring to the commands of a taller individual that stands far back from the melee and issues orders in their rasping, staccato tongue, all the while conjuring powerful magics to aid their fellows.  It is unknown what gods they worship, but given their fondness for technology and sorcery, as well as secrecy, it is likely that some Aspect of Ksarul is held in high regard.

	Vleshgayal Names

The Vleshgayal seldom speak to outsiders, so their names are unknown.  Their language is unpronounceable, so they may prefer nicknames. 

##### Vleshgayal Traits

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1\.

**Age.** The Shunned Ones live about three times as long as humans, about 135 years on average

**Alignment.** Shunned Ones are usually neutral, having their own goals and motivations that appear arcane to observers.

**Dispassionate Demeanor.** You have advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws.

You are also proficient with one tool of your choice. Whenever you make an ability check with the chosen skill or tool, roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the check total.

**Malefic Odour.** You have a distinctive odour and have disadvantage on attempts to avoid detection within 60m/200 ft.  As a bonus action, you can exhale this odour as an especially potent concentrated vapor. Creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you that can smell you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you until the end of your next turn. The DC of the save equals 8 \+ your proficiency bonus \+ your Constitution modifier. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

**Poison Immunity.** You are immune to poison and the poisoned condition.

**Anaerobic Respiration.**  You can breathe and survive in an oxygenated environment for up to six days, suffering one level of exhaustion for every day afterwards.  You can recover from this exhaustion only through magic or by immersing yourself in a poisonous atmosphere for at least 4 hours.

**Languages.** You can speak , read, and write Shunned One, and two other languages of your choice.  The Shunned Ones language sounds like fat roasting on a cooking fire, an unintelligible series of hissing and sharp pops; it presumably has a written form, as the Shunned Ones often consult scrolls made of some paper-like substance.

### ***Exotic***

The exotic races are infrequently encountered in the lands of the Five Empires and thus have no concrete history to form any attitude regarding them.  They dwell in distant lands or in environments too alien for humans to survive.  Perhaps they have relationships with similarly exotic nations of humanity, but to most others they are complete and utter strangers.

#### *Chíma* 

The Chima dwell far away from the lands of the Five Empires, ranging the seas of the southwest on great, handsome ships or massive flotillas of sturdy rafts.  They have only recently come into contact with the north, introduced by the Nasqai tribes of the Southern Continent.  First impressions have been positive, they are gregarious and welcoming of strangers, with great interest in the craftsmanship of other cultures.  Their ships are a melange of different trinkets, tools and weapons acquired from those they have encountered.  The Chima are also excellent craftsmen themselves, incorporating newfound innovations into their designs.  They wear no clothing, but instead paint their bodies with colorful designs, some colors of which cannot be seen by humans.

##### The Seafarers

The Seafarers, as the Chima are sometimes known, are human-sized bipeds covered in speckled gray-green leathery skin.  Their multi-jointed arms are very long, almost brushing the ground, ending with strong hands with four slender, dextrous fingers.  Their heads are large ovoids, with bright green eyes set under heavy brows, large leafy ears and an overly long hooked beak above a small mouth.  A comb of dark fur runs down their spine to their stumpy tails, often dyed in multiple colors.  The Chima are oviparous, laying greenish gelatinous eggs; the vast majority of Chima are females, while males are a mere fraction of the population, their contribution to society is not insubstantial.

The Chima are predominantly pescaterian, trawling the seas for fish and cultivating a grass-like seaweed as a staple crop.  They are also fond of the flesh of a swift, hooved animal found only on a single island in their territories, which abounds with palatial ruins and small meadows. 

The Chima revere a small pantheon of sea spirits, each sea is governed by one of these spirits and is worshipped on island shrines within their boundaries.  The Sky House of Temuelgo is one of these island-shrines, built to honor the sea spirit Temuelgo, mistress of the seas just north of the south pole.  It is almost always awash in auroras of blue, purple, magenta, silver and gray that can be seen for several *Tsan* around.

#### *Hokún*

The Hokun dwell across dozens of small islands across Tekumel, each with its own unique culture.  The largest and most powerful is the island-nation of Benré Sà in the southeastern oceans, where the Hokun hunt humans for food, seeing them merely as clever animals.  Other nations of Hokun have enslaved humanity and some even live with mankind as equals.  There are even places where humanity has enslaved the Hokun and use them as riding-beasts\!  If any sophont can rival mankind for the dominance of Tekumel, it is the Hokun, as their diversity affords them the means to weather any travails. In temperament, the Hokun are suave and discerning, often said to be as smooth and golden tongued as a Livyani diplomat. 

##### The Glass Monsters

The Hokun are also known as the Glass Monsters, as their exoskeleton resembles cloudy, gray-green crystal, their viscera is similarly transparent, but visible under close examination. They are six-limbed and primarily quadrupedal, but can stand on their rear legs for short periods of time.  Their heads are long vertical ovoids divided by a crest of chitin, on either side lie jeweled eyes with vertical pseudopupils.  Males are a slight majority of the population, outnumbering females, two to one, how this affects their customs varies from colony to colony.

Like the Pe Choi, the Hokun have the faintly acidic odor of dri-ants, but Pe Choi find this to be particularly abhorrent and the Hokun dislike the Pe Choi equally.  Both sophonts smell “wrong” to each other.

The Hokun often employ some sort of mutant called a “Sáàkü” as a riding beast, a Saaku resembles a Hokun, but is shorter, more squat, less translucent and possesses only animal cunning.  They are unmistakably the same species though, curiously the riders of the Saaku also call themselves Saaku.  Most Hokun nations fashion weapons and tools from the glass-like exoskeletons of dead Saaku, while others use the exoskeletons of their own dead.

Generally, Hokun have little in the way of individuality, most cultures possess a participatory ”group-mind”, and each Hokun society develops in different ways to balance the ambitions of these group-minds.  It is possible to leave a group-mind and join another, or even create a new one, but such uprooting is uncommon, most Hokun stay in the group-mind they were born into.  They have no gods as such, but seem to take guidance from an all-knowing “World-Mind”, which may be godlike in essence.

Hokun Names

Hokun names change over time, as the group-mind’s identity evolves with the new experiences of its members, the demise of old members and the addition of new ones.   Events that occur half a world away can change the personality of the group-mind as a whole.

#### *Mihálli* 

*“... some creature out of an ancient bestiary, furred all over, a snarling animal muzzle rimmed with up-curving fangs, pointed ears like those of a Renyu, two arms that were over-long, jointed in places where no human—or Pé Chói—had joints. Then the edges of the beast’s image sparkled, faded, and solidified into other features ...”* 

**\-M.A.R. Barker, The Man of Gold**

Few living people have crossed paths with the Mihálli, or perhaps more accurately, few have knowingly.  Ancient historical records claim they once dwelt in the lands now known as Mihallu and warred with their human contemporaries.  They were remarkable sorcerers and are said to have built their stronghold, the Unstraightened City, in only one day and night.  The legends describe them as unintelligible, being helpful and friendly at one moment, the next becoming a terrible foe or even vanishing into thin air\!  They passed into the realm of myth when an enemy king discovered a weapon left behind by the Great Ancients and in an attempt to subjugate the Mihalli, destroyed the Unstraightened City and made the Plains of Glass as they are today. 

##### The Shape-Changers

The Mihalli are the most humanoid of the sophonts that inhabit Tekumel, but have five fingers and thumb on their hands and a head that resembles that of a caracal cat with opalescent red eyes.  They are almost hairless, but have a variety of skin tones, it is possible that the colors of which have some significance in Mihalli society, as their warriors are often dull green in coloration, while their leader caste are of a reddish brown.  Given their reputation as Shape-Changers, adopting new skin colors would be a paltry exercise and certain professions or social stations might demand specific coloration.  As they can see more colors than humans, some of these may be difficult for outsiders to discern.

In the old epics, the Mihalli play the role of tricksters, bringing wisdom with jest and atrocity with a smile.  Utilizing their shape-changing abilities to sow confusion and manipulate noble heroes into ignoble circumstances.  While the Mihalli of myth seem to fly from one form to another, it does take the average Mihalli a bit of effort to shape-change.  These “average” Mihalli call themselves the Drengh-Mihalli, and they refer to Mihalli of myth as Vitru-Mihalli. They claim the Vitru-Mihalli have no shape and are thus able to shape-change with more proficiency.  Curiously, the Mihalli did not possess this trait in prehistoric times, those encountered by humanity in the Dorsum star system held to only one shape.

Once a Mihalli has taken a shape, they will feel perfectly at home within their new skin.  By  casual examination, they will appear to be that person, barring any changes in costume or other accoutrements.  The myths say you can always tell a Mihalli by its eyes, if the light catches them just right, their eyes gleam like rubies.

The Mihalli are hermaphroditic, with an individual functioning as a male at one time and as an infant-producing female at another.

 	Mihálli Names

It is unknown if the Mihálli have proper names at all.  They primarily use those of other races, sometimes adopting the identity of someone they are impersonating.

#### *Nyaggá* 

Beneath the waves of Lake Parunal, the Nyagga dwell aloof and secure in their mastery of waters.  Though they do not threaten the human ships that ply the surface, they will react with exacting hostility to those who intrude upon their aquatic domains.  Much of what is known about the Nyagga is hearsay, collected from sailors who pass over Nyagga cities when the waters are clear.  They report dozens of Nyagga congregating in roofless temples, engaged in unknowable rituals below.  On the shores, fishing communities sometimes trade with Dwellers Below; leaving food or items the Nyagga are thought to like & come sunrise, they are left with treasures from depths of the lake.  The odd-looking people of Ngaku, Pranju and other lakeside settlements are rumored to be the half-human offspring of the Nyagga.

##### The Dwellers Below

The Nyagga have pallid, flexible eel-like bodies, about nine feet in length.  Their bulbous, jawless heads are surrounded by a ring of six jet-black eyes and six retractable tentacles lined with tiny cilia; these are quite weak individually and several must be used in concert to handle objects and wield weapons.  In water, the Nyagga propel themselves with their long, muscular tails, but on land they slither about and crawl with their tentacles. Despite these differences, the Nyagga are essentially mammals; breathing air, having warm-blood, giving live birth and nursing their young with milk.  They need water to create a protective coat of mucus, shielding their bodies from the detrimental effects of sunlight upon their flesh.  The color and scent of which has some significance in Nyagga culture.

Nyaggá Names

Interactions with Nyaggá are brief, rare and always silent affairs.  It is unknown if they even have names at all.

##### Nyagga Traits

**Ability Score Increase.**  Your Strength, Constitution, and Wisdom scores each increase by 1\.

**Size.** Nyaggá slither across the ground, averaging about 9 feet long. Your size is Medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 20 feet, and 40 feet when swimming.

**All-Around Vision.** With a pair of eyes on every side of your cylindrical body, you cannot be snuck upon unless by a hidden opponent.  

**Darkvision**. Accustomed to life underwater, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

**Muculent Skin.** Thanks to your slimy skin, you have advantage on checks to resist grapples  and escaping bonds.  Unfortunately, this slime also impedes fine manipulation, you have disadvantage on Sleight of Hand checks.

**Limited Amphibiousness.** You can breathe air and water, but you need to be submerged at least once every four hours to avoid suffocating.

**Guardians of the Depths.** Adapted to even the most extreme ocean depths, you have resistance to cold damage, and you ignore any of the drawbacks caused by a deep, underwater environment.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Nyaggá and another language of your choice.  Nyaggá is a peculiar language that can only be properly spoken (if such a term can be used) underwater, it consists of a range of subharmonic utterances.

#### *Urunén* 

The Urunen are newcomers, having only just begun to contact the lands of the Northern Continent.  The Cold-Dwellers are clever, proud and jealous, much like the game-players of Salarvya.  Their culture is as sophisticated as any of the Five Empires, located somewhere near the South Pole.  Urunen civilization has been systematically exploring Tekumel by means of the ancient tubeways, with well-funded expeditions on a mission of scholarship led by an elite corp of emissaries.

##### The Cold Dwellers

The Urunen are mostly humanoid, but with velvety, brownish fur, a long tail and hooved feet.  Their heads are triangular, resembling something between a serpent or a moose, with a long snout and wide set eyes capable of moving independently.  Both sexes grow tusks throughout their lives, females sharpen their tusks as a mark of beauty, while males decorate theirs with rings. Their culture is matriarchal by majority; females are always born as triplets, while males are typically single births.  Urunen ”family structures” are strong, polygamous dynasties built on delicate gift-exchanges and numerous formal dinners for the families concerned.  

Their society is highly stratified along occupational lines, with artisans, merchants, and scholars held in high esteem; the Urunen Empire’s public educational system is without equal, well-funded and well-loved by the populace.  Soldiers are seen as a necessary evil, there is little prestige in becoming a career soldier, Urunen armies are small, but effective.  Urunen tubeway expeditions are well-funded missions of scholarship, led by an ambassadorial caste called the *Alol* (“Parent”).

For centuries, Urunen archaeologists have been meticulously studying the artifacts and ruins left behind by the Great Ancients.  They are familiar with humanity academically, but up until recently had thought mankind to be extinct.  They seem eager to engage with humanity, but their cleverness makes them difficult allies and dangerous foes, should their trust be betrayed.

The southern polar region is temperate in climate and rich in agricultural wealth, quite unlike the pleasant, but rocky tundra of the far north.  The Urunen have meticulously cultivated this landmass over millennia, resulting in a large, culturally homogenous empire.  The Urunen culture has weathered tumultuous events such as civil wars, plagues and famines, but they have yet to make contact with other sophonts.

The Urunen worship a trio of deities, each with a specific theological role and worshiped in great cubical temples set in the center of their cities: Diule, a hermaphroditic creator deity; Almilo, a lawful guardian of civilization and Wasuro, a chaotic trickster.  The entire continent is littered with small cubical shrines for the numerous nature and house spirits that occupy their lands.

## ***The Joyful Sitting Among Friends***

The sophonts described above are merely a sampling of the Tekumelani, the planet is large enough for dozens more to dwell upon forgotten lands. The more familiar races of the D\&D multiverse could inhabit your Tékumel; either as uncommon alien species, mutants bred by sorcery or distant cousins of humanity.  On occasion, minor beings from the Planes Beyond perchance come to Tekumel and make it their home. These can be incorporated at your Dungeon Master’s discretion, in keeping with the sort of Tékumel you wish to have adventures within.

	***Aarakocra,*** the legends of Mu’ugalavya once describe the Great Waste of Galai as being lush and fertile, but a race of mighty sorcerers called the “Dwellers on the Mount'' that dwelt upon Churu Peak greatly offended Lord Hrsh and he blasted their lands with sheets of flame.  These dwellers of the peak are thought to be extinct, but some report seeing strange, bird-like creatures flying around the ruins atop the mountain.

**Aasimar,** during the Battle of Dormoron Plain, the gods summoned allies from across the Many Worlds.  The Miyusal and other “Heroes of Glory” answered the call from Karakan, these female warrior-demons are said to resemble statuesque women with golden-red skin, who shunned armor as a weakness.  Many lineages claim descent from these mythical Heroes of Glory and although none are asked to prove such ancestries, on rare occasions a child is born with the spark of the divine.

	**Dwarves,** beneath the city of Purdimal and its surrounding Huqundali swampland, dwells two similar nonhuman races, the Hehecháru or the “First Dwellers” live in the Great Morass and make a living harvesting lumber from *Ssar* trees, whose pure white wood is used to fashion staffs and arrow shafts.  Their cousins, the Hehegánu, are often called the “Old Ones of Púrdimal'' and dwell in the shallow levels of the city’s underworld, they brew Tsolyanu’s most exquisite liqueurs.  Both races are short and squat, hairless, with flat, noseless faces and mottled grayish skin. The distinction between the two are lost upon anyone who does not dwell in the region.

	**Dragonborn,** the Temple of Vimuhla keeps a record of all of the demons and creatures that serve the Lord of Flame and the means of summoning them.  The Book of Burnings, as it is called, describes a race of brazen dragon-headed warriors called the Chohlu’arth, servants of one of Vimuhla’s vassal demon lords; Mrugga, He With Scales of Fire.  Modern attempts made to summon these beings bring forth a similar race calling themselves the Kholur.  Though fearsome to behold in battle, they lack the legendary bloodlust of their forebears and are much more even-tempered than would be anticipated from followers of Vimuhla.

	**Elves & Half-Elves,** the lithe, almond-eyed inhabitants of Lost Bayársha seem human enough, but have obviously been touched by something otherworldly.  They possess formidable mental powers that allow them to quickly locate and enslave foreign interlopers.  Half-human spies are sent out to neighboring Livyanu and Mu'ugalavya to ensure the lost city remains hidden from outsiders. The Fungus Eater tribes of M’morcha are similarly isolationist, but are generally thought to be benevolent.

**Goliaths,** the far north is a harsh realm and it breeds a different kind of folk. If you prefer, Goliaths may be an adequate substitute for N’luss or Lorun characters. Be sure to reach an agreement with your Dungeon Master before taking this variant character option. 

	**Halflings,** when traveling the woodlands of the far north, the tribes of Chayakku leave offerings of food or small trinkets to the Sikun for good luck.  Commonly assumed to be clever beasts that obstinately refuse to be tamed, these “Little Men” are probably some sort of mutant bred by the sorcerer-scientists of the ancient world.  The Sikun are small, portly humanoid creatures, covered in tan fur with a short trunk-like snout.  They dwell in underground burrows of up to two to three hundred individuals, the tunnels lined with rubbish. 

**Reborn**, the vast majority of undead are little more than mindless corpse-shells animated only at the behest of Sarku, Lord of Worms.  For some unfathomable purpose, the Master of the Undead exalts some of his followers to an elect status after their bodily death.  These Jaygi are wholly undead, but retain the majority of their faculties, most retreating to communities in the Underworlds, though some still remain active in the affairs of their clans, such as the Liche Lords of clan Ito,, ancient hereditary rules of the Chakas 

	**Tabaxi,** the woodlands of the Kurt Hills of Tsolyanu are home to a reclusive race of feline bipeds the locals call Tiunyu.  They are fickle creatures, sometimes ambushing travelers and at other times rescuing those in distress.  It is believed they are mutants bred at the whim of the Ancients, similar to the dog-like Renyu, only capable of speech.

	**Tritons,** you would sooner find a pearl in the Plains of Glass than find a town on the  coast of Lake Parunal that lacks Káitlani, amphibious humanoids possessing pallid skin and vestigial gills.  They are most common in Ngakü and Prájnu, making a living as divers, fishermen and other maritime trades.  Though they are a minority in the city of Kaitlan, they are intimately bound into the city’s culture and ruling elite.  The strange appearance of the Kaitlani has given rise to rumors that their ancestors interbred with the Nyaggá who dwell beneath Lake Parunal.

	**Warforged,** prehistoric Tekumel was an age of technological marvels, the least of these being the androids that served and protected the guests of the world’s many resorts.  Though their masters are now dust, they remain, built to last millenia, wandering in forgotten palatial bunkers or ruined factories.  Most have degraded into maddened machines, but some still retain a semblance of their artificial sapience, such automatons include deadly war machines such as the Ru’un and the beautiful Yeleth, designed to provide companionship for the galaxy’s elite.

	**Yuan-Ti,** a race of mutants bred by ancient sorcerer-scientists, the Qol are serpent-like humanoids that keep to the shallower levels of the underworlds.  They seem to have some relationship with the Temple of Ksarul, who commonly employ the Qol as guardians for their subterranean shrines.  They are an extremely mutable people, displaying all manner of bizarre confluences of human and ophidian traits, but the most human seeming appear as golden-eyed albinos.  The legendary hero, Chirene of N’luss, is often depicted as having a serpent’s head, but modern historians consider this to be merely an embellishment.

# **Law of Noble Comradeship \- Class Options**

Empire of the Petal Throne only had the original three D\&D classes (Fighting-Man, Priest and Magic-User), but any of the modern classes can find a place within Tékumel.  The forthcoming section will provide suggestions for subclasses and their place within the cultural history of Tekumel.

The inhabitants of the Five Empires consider it exceedingly noble to devote oneself entirely to a particular pursuit.  Martial classes and magic-users seldom take interest in their counterparts' professions; most magicians believe physical combat to be beneath their talents and likewise, most warriors prefer the thrill of clashing blades to rote spellcraft.  That said, there are still adventurers who bridge this divide, warriors who dabble in the great arts and magicians who enjoy swordsmanship.  These fickle souls are seen as eccentrics at best and ignoble reprobates at worst

Law of Noble Comradeship: Being with a group and doing it no harm while the association lasts.  This principle dates back to the first councils of the priest-kings of the Engsvnayali Empire.  While sworn to such duty, the empire rose to unparalleled prosperity.

## **Artificer (*Hricháitokoi*)**

*“How ignoble to deprive the sorcerer of his uniqueness, to put magic within reach of any idiot who acquires a device.”* **\-Fíru Bá Yéker, imperial scribe and priest of Sarku**

Once Tekumel knelt to the power of technology, the whole world remade to suit the whims of its spacefaring masters. But millennia of knowledge lost coupled with poor stewardship of the planet’s resources may have permanently crippled Tekumel’s technological development.  Cultural factors are also to blame, the printing press was once invented in Mu’ugalavya, but was sabotaged by the local scribal clans.  Moreover, the advent of magic has rendered entire branches of science obsolete, a Salarvayani scholar discovered the means for making black powder, but this innovation was met with mocking displays of fire spells.  

But the secrets of the Great Ancients remain a source of wonder to artificers, who seek to puzzle out the scraps of prehistoric technology and put them to clever use, likely in ways they were never meant for.  Artificers on Tekumel are unique in that their devices are more often found than made; artifacts manufactured tens of thousands of years ago using methods that present Tekumelani could never hope to replicate.  Whatever these artifacts were originally isn't relevant, your artificer may have theories, but ultimately they have no frame of reference to understand how ansibles, nanotechnology or interfogulators work. 

###### 

### ***Artificer Specializations***

Alchemists (*Biyúrmongér*) are common across the Five Empires and beyond, experimenting with the unusual substances found upon the world.  Through their works came the means of curing the hide of the dinosaurian *chlen*, creating a material that rivals bronze in strength, but is lighter to wear and can be honed to a sharper edge.  

The Lightning Bringer is a feared piece of ancient technology, in the skilled hands of an Artillerist (*Babáiltokoi*), it can launch thunderous volleys that pulverize flesh and stone.  Only fifteen of these devices are known to exist, three of which in the Imperial Arsenal at Avanthar, such treasures and those that can operate them are rare and highly sought after.  

Within the passages of the old epic, the Lament to the Wheel of Black, the god Karakan, Lord of War, summons a legion of warriors known as the Silver Suits to fight alongside Him at the Battle of Dormoron Plain.  Every one of these great heroes was clad in gleaming metal armor and famed for their technological skills.  Many perished in the fighting, but the survivors retired to found many clans, their magnificent suits of armor awaiting discovery in ancestral tombs by their Armorer (*Jayulenggáshukoi*) descendents.

###### 

## **Barbarian (*Tsaishéltokh*)**

Though the Five Empires are the center of civilization, they are surrounded by smaller nations populated by nomadic bands of barbarians.  Though these nations have sophisticated societies, they have never known the glories of the Engsvanyali Empire and thus have never been truly civilized.  No barbarians have left a greater mark upon Tekumel than the Dragon Warriors, who very nearly conquered the world in their age.  Their rule was bloody and short, but long enough to bring the worship of the primeval incarnation of Vimuhla to the south.

###### 

### ***Primal Paths***

The Path of the Berserker (*Mu'onikh hiZhamakikh*) is found exclusively among the normally peaceful Páchi Léi, who suffer spasmodic rages known as *Biyúrh*, violently attacking anyone or anything in sight before collapsing.  Afterwards, the Berserker is always forgiven of any injuries or deaths inflicted during these episodes, and the incident is never spoken of again.  

The Path of the Totem Warrior (*Mu'onikh hiVrunPurdalmokoi*) is common in the uncivilized nations of Lorún, M’mórcha and Nmartúsha; the *zrné* being the favorite totem of the Rannaluyani.  The usual totem spirits are unknown to the Tekumelani, who instead have found animal guides more suitable to this alien world; such as the *Dlakolel* (Bear), *Kurrune* (Eagle), *Hyahyu’u* (Wolf), *Nraishu* (Elk) and *Zrne* (Tiger).  

The Path of the Zealot (*Mu'onikh hiTlashúmikh*) is common among the nihilistic inhabitants of Hlikku, the City of the Mad Ones.  No one knows why the Yan Koryani tolerate this sect, who supposedly worship the Pariah Gods, perhaps the legion of Zealots provided to the army are reason enough.

###### 

## **Bard (*Terútokoi*)**

*“A street-girl of Jakálla can charm a Mu'ugalavyáni bureaucrat out from under his files, a Salarvyáni merchant away from his coins, or even a Páchi Léi down from his tree…”*  **\- From “The Illusion of Life”, by the poetess Elue**

Bards, or rather Poets, are commonplace across the Five Empires.  Poetry has long been considered a noble art form, ever since the days of the Bednalljan Dynasty.  So while professional poets are typically of low social status, they are highly paid, free to travel from country to country and forbidden from being sold as slaves; their life and property held sacrosanct. 

The great epics are recited at celebrations great and small; from festivals and funerals, to weddings and coronations.  These poems deal with mythical and semi-historical subjects; such as “The Lament to the Wheel of Black”, which describes the battle between the gods at the dawn of time or the “Epic of Mighty Hrugga”, regarding the feats of a popular folk hero.  Contemporary poems also find broad appeal, such as the ribald satire “The Illusion of Life”, about a clever street-girl from Jakalla who marries into a noble clan, much to the chagrin of her husband’s clan-elders.  

Performance of the full epics is more to the liking of the upper-classes, which are supplemented by orchestras, choruses and masked actor-dancers.  The lower classes enjoy abridged versions sung in marketplaces, with passages accompanied only by light music. 

#### ***Bard Colleges***

The College of Swords (*Sijakkanikh hiSsyukoi*) is practiced by the matriarchs of Yán Kor, where sword-dancing is considered a form of high art every nobleborn woman should know.  While it’s artistic merits are without doubt, sword-dancing also imparts martial prowess to the young women of Yan Kor.

The Mu’ugalavyáni take pride in the works of their culture-heroes such as Ilelúnish, the Bard of Ch’óchi and Bi'isumish, the Blind Poet of Ssa'átis.  The College of Lore (*Sijakkanikh hiBalamtsanikh*) are also held in great esteem, who recite the epic poems that glorify their history.

No upper-class feast in the Five Empires would be complete without a puppet-show, where puppetmasters of the College of Creation (*Sijakkanikh hiMoyi-kh*) animate simulacra of wood, metal and bone with other-planar magic, acting out plays or even performing mock duels, the winner of which is claimed to be unknown by the puppetmaster.  The puppetmaster clans such as the Society of the Hands Which Are Not Seen guard the secrets of this animation closely, having a close relationship with the assassin clans to prevent theft.  

Urunen expeditions through the subterranean tubeways are always led by an *Alol*, a sort of adventurer-diplomat much like the College of Eloquence (*Sijakkanikh hiBaratokoi*).  Under their guidance, expeditions thought doomed returned with tales of exotic lands and bountiful riches.

## **Cleric (*Shártokoi*)**

*“Become a priest and know neither hunger nor calluses.”* **\-Éngsvanyáli adage**

To be a cleric is to be the hand of your god upon the world.  The ways of the gods may be mysterious, but they are not distant.  While not every priest can channel the divinity of the gods, every Temple hosts clerics that have been granted such a blessing.  They are sent across the land to further the goals of their priesthoods and by extension, those of the gods.  Though the Concordat forbids outright warfare between priests of Change and Stability, such conflicts still occur, albeit with subtler means.  Clerics are not shy to display their piety, it is common to clad oneself in clothing or dust your skin in the color of your god.

### ***Divine Domains***

The ambiguity of Tekumelani theology allows for clerics of many Divine Domains, even under the same god.  Since the gods are worshiped under multiple Aspects, they often possess Domains other than what they would typically be associated with.  So while Karakan is more familiarly associated with the War Domain (*QadardaliKartu'unikh*), even the mother-goddess  Avanthe has a martial Aspect in the form of Katha the Warrior Maid, patroness of victory.  

The gods of lands outside the Five Empires and those of nonhumans are presumed to be merely Aspects of the Engsvanyali pantheon. The gentle Nyesemeli worship a goddess of the Tempest Domain (*GrujungKartu'unikh*) named Mretten, the Goddess Who Walks Upon the Sea.  The Shen have a similar deity called Hu-Shra, Lord of Winds, who is considered a rather greedy god, sailors always leave little melon cakes at His shrines before taking to the waters.

Even within the Five Empires, the localized incarnations of various gods can be quite different, such as the Mu’ugalavyani diety Hrsh, Master of Space, Time and Being; for whom Vimuhla is considered a mere Aspect\!  Outsiders commonly believe Hrsh to be an amalgamation of Hnalla and the Lord of Flame, as all three share the Light Domain (*JerikhKartu'unikh*), albeit in different capacities.

## **Druid (*Chamáng*)**

The Temple priesthoods look down upon the primeval faiths of non-Engsvanyali lands, scorning those who do not know the gods of Pavar.  But the gods possess multitudes of Aspects with which to work upon the world, many of which are unknown to the Temples of the Five Empires.  The wilds are also home to multitudes of spirits and small gods that cross paths with the nomads that roam there.  Druids, or rather, Shamans are needed to intervene on behalf of offended spirits and collect the blood-price (*shámtla*) from those that have wronged them.  

### ***Druid Circles***

Druids of the Circle of the Land (*Kartu'unikh hiShazirikh*) can be found amongst any of the uncivilized nations of the world, but arctic Druids are unique to the Lorun tribes of the far north.  Few seek out the life of a shaman, rather they are called by dream-quests or supernatural visitations; afterwards, it is up to the would-be shaman to find a master to study under.  

In the tribal states of the far northeast live a sect of forest ascetics called *Greshu*, who fulfill the role of the Circle of the Shepherd (*Kartu'unikh hiRa'i-kh*).  These hermits typically shun civilization and its temptations, preferring to dwell alone or in small groups within hilltop fanes.  Their astere practices meant to keep the confidence of forest spirits such as the stalwart *Dlakolel* (Bear), the keen-eyed *Kuni* (Hawk) and the graceful *Ngekka* (Unicorn).

Just prior to the age of the Dragon Warriors, N’luss shamans made contact with the god Vimuhla, eagerly adopting the Lord of Flame as their patron deity and syncretizing His worship with their ancestral faith, approximating the Circle of Wildfire (*Kartu'unikh hiHlatsalkoi*).  The Red Robes, as they were known, lit a spark in the minds of the disparate warbands of N’lussa, uniting them into a great horde that swept across the south like a raging conflagration.  

## **Fighter (*Púrdalmokoi*)**

Becoming a warrior is one of the few means a commoner has to rise in social standing, both within the Five Empires and without.  Though many clans train their members from birth to become soldiers, armies will take any able-bodied soul willing to fight into their ranks.  Warriors of high social ranking will certainly look down upon a peer from the commoner clans, but few can deny skill in battle.  Considering the tumultuous state of Tekumel; gladiators and professional soldiers alike will find plenty of opportunities to ply their trade.

### ***Martial Archetypes***

Every major city in Five Empires have Hirilakte Arenas, where ritualized gladiatorial duels are held for entertainment, with Champions (*Hirilaktekoi*) fighting for glory against their fellows, savage beasts and captured members of the inimical races.  On occasion, they may be called to serve an important geopolitical role, fulfilling a portion of the ancient code known as the Manifesto of Noble Deliverance.  The Five Empires have fought entire wars solely within the arena circuit, the only casualties being a series of Champions.  The arenas are especially popular in Tsolyanu, where it is considered the national pastime and every village above a certain size has one.

*“The skeins of noble persons are as short as Arél-ants; the ignoble live on forever.”* **\-Tsolyanu proverb**

The military nobility of the Five Empires are seldom seen without a retinue of personal guards reminiscent of Samurai (*Nléshtokoi*), serving their lords faithfully, sometimes tragically when their duty conflicts with their honor.  The Manifesto of Noble Deliverance provides guidance for most of these moral crossroads, but men are as novel as they are ignoble.

Cavaliers are unheard of within the Five Empires, which lack anything approximating a horse & wouldn’t even recognize one if they saw it.  Regardless, a noble warrior would never sully their honor by riding a low beast into the sacred battlefield. Mu’ugalavyáni generals initially mocked the *bazháq*\-riders of Tané, but were forced to admit their utility as their expedition faltered.

###### 

## **Monk (*Charágetokoi*)**

The greatest obstacle to true nobility is oneself.  Even if one outwardly seeks Alignment to a greater purpose, the internal enemies of doubt, shame, trauma and indolence will always seek to disrupt one’s fulfillment of their destiny.  Even priests lack the piety to give themselves entirely to the gods, hence the elaborate hierarchies within the Temples of Change and the fractious politics of the Temples of Stability.  But there are those priests who hear the calling of the gods acutely enough to remake themselves in the image of their deity.  Sequestering themselves in isolated monasteries, far from the distractions of the world, to meditate upon their Skein of Destiny, the Alignment of the gods, and of noble action.  On occasion, monks are bidden by their abbot to travel the world and seek out challenges to put their nobility to the test.  Much as the wrestler in the arena struggles against his foe, so must these monks struggle against the greatest foe of all, the self.  As there is little vocational difference between a monk and a priest, the term for “wrestler” has been colloquially applied to monks, perhaps aptly, as by practicing martial arts, monks hone the Five Selves and become empty vessels to enact the will of the gods. 

###### 

### ***Monastic Traditions***

The monks of the god Ksarul, Lord of Secrets, are often of the Way of Shadow (*Mu'onikh hiChúsuni-kh*).  Their sanctuary, Hauninngakte Monestary, is hidden within the eastern mountains of Tsolyanu, every path leading to the monastery is set with traps and illusions, only those who have mastered the nimble footwork of the martial art, *Hu’on*, and the benefits it brings to the *Chusetl* (the Shadow-Self), can pierce the illusions enough for a safe journey.

The Way of the Drunken Master (*Mu'onikh hiPortsóVusijaktokoi*) are found amongst Yán Koryáni sects of the wine goddess Tlóm, the local incarnation of Dlamélish, Lady of Pleasures.  By subjecting their *Bakte* (the Body-Shell) to greater sensations and surpassing their physical limitations, they become closer to the Green-Eyed Lady. 

Within the Liar of the Undying, the subterranean monastery beneath the City of Sárku, the monks of the Lord of Worms train in the Way of the Long Death,better known as the Way of the Sepulchre (*Mu'onikh hiMuknalkanikh*).  The most senior members of this tradition practice a form of self-mummification, imbibing miniscule amounts of poisons over the course of years, halting the decay of the flesh while preserving their *Hlakme* (the Ego-Mind).  

The Way of the Sun-Soul (*Mu'onikh hiTulengBakh*) is practiced by the adherents of the Mu’ugalavyani diety Hrsh, who meditate beneath the midday sun atop the sacred mountain of Mu’ugalla, cultivating the emotive force of the *Pedhetl* (the Inner-Enemy) until their heroic souls are worthy fuel for Hrsh’s purifying flame.

The monks of Thumis commonly follow the Way of Mercy (*Mu'onikh hiMazikikh*), who are well loved by the populace for healing the sick.  Though it may seem incongruous, their practice of *Dedaratl* makes them better physicians, as the martial art teaches monks how to focus their *Baletl* (the Spirit-Soul), allowing their hands to become either weapons or instruments of healing. 

#### 	*The Five Selves*

Bakte (the Body-Shell) \- physical sensation, creature comforts and material appetites

Chusetl (the Shadow-Self) \- intuition, introspection and imagination

Hlakme (the Ego-Mind) \- identity, consciousness, intellect

Pedhetl (the Inner-Enemy) \- emotion, desire and ambition

Baleltl (the Spirit-Soul) \- spiritual development and renewal

###### 

## **Paladin (*Katanléshkoi*)**

*"Noble acts raise even the lowest soul to become divine.”* **\-Scrolls of Pavar**

The gods value noble action above all else, when one’s thoughts and deeds are aligned perfectly.  They abhor ignoble action, when one hesitates or is false to their ideals.  At times, the gods see fit to exalt mortals of rare nobility, granting them a mote of the divine.  Some serve as temple-guards or within the personal armies of the Temples.  Regardless, these paladins are charged by the gods to steer the world towards the supernal goals of their pantheon; either the Perfect Light of Stability or the Eternal Ephemerality of Change.

###### 

### ***Sacred Oaths***

The Oath of the Crown (*Ma'atsikh hiMentukoi*) is most commonly found amidst the Omnipotent Azure Legion, the bodyguards and spies of the god-emperor of Tsolyanu.  Everyday, deaf-mute children around Tsolyanu are given into the care of the Legion and raised to give their lives for the Petal Throne. Only an elite circle is allowed into the god-emperor’s presence, the Servitors in Silence, who attend to the emperor and keep all secrets witnessed. 

The Oath of Vengeance (*Ma'atsikh hiKhangakh*) is practiced frequently in Yán Kor, associated with the culture-hero Nchél, who swore to atone for her cowardice so that she may know peace in the afterlife.  Fortitude, endurance, patience; these are the stepping stones that lay at the threshold to the Way of Nchel, as taught to all nobleborne children in Yan Kor.

*“A Dló kisses the foot that steps on his face.”* **\- Salarvyáni proverb**

The Dló tribe of eastern Rannálu are known to be pacifistic, almost to the point of masochism and are the only known people who swear the Oath of Redemption (*Ma'atsikh hiChranku*).  Though the common folk may not be able to do more than prostrate themselves before an enemy, a Dlo paladin has greater means at their disposal to defend the innocent without bloodshed.

By ancient treaty, the Forbidden City of Dlash has enjoyed independence from the rest of Livyanu, but likewise does not benefit from the empire’s protection.  Within the city's walls, the Paranormal Police protect the city and its populace from otherworldly horrors that wander through untended Nexus Points.  Their forces are composed of those sworn to the Oath of the Watchers (*Ma'atsikh hiTennmrekh*) identified by their flanged, blank-featured, bone-white masks.

The Mourners in Sable are the elite guard of the Temple of Hrsh upon the sacred island-mountain of Mu’ugalla.  They serve as the secret police for the Mu’ugalavyani state and  have sworn the Oath of Conquest (*Ma'atsikh hiMrabankoi*) in the name of Kténgish, the bloodthirsty deity that serves Hrsh.  No state executions within Mu’ugalavya are performed without the sanction of the Mourners, with terrible penalties dispensed upon those who deny them their due.

## **Ranger (*Hmüntokoi*)**

The wilderness of Tekumel is fecund with the life of a thousand worlds, with ecosystems cobbled together like an old sleeping mat.  It requires a special breed of ranger to pierce these wilds, someone who can make sense of a world that was never meant to be.  The ranger must know their prey better than they know themselves, it is a matter of honor.  One must treat their foe as an equal in status and ability.  To do anything less than ultimate excellence is to insult your nobility.  

### ***Ranger Conclaves***

Every culture of Tekumel have historically trained several kinds of animals, the Beast Masters (*Baradtomikh*) have tamed creatures such as the loyal *renyu* or the clever *küni*, but the Ghatóni are renowned for being the only people known to tame the murderous *sérudla*. 

The Livyani are rumored to practice strange rituals involving other-planar sorcery and demon summoning.  The Hierarchs of Tsamra are many things, but they are not fools; they keep an elite corps of Horizon Walkers (*Miyutláyo* \- lit. “He Who Walks the Planes”), tasked with guarding known nexus points and protecting the empire from other-planar threats.

Beneath the surface of Tekumel are vast labyrinthine Underworlds; the shallowest levels lay beneath major cities; home to the desperate, criminals, and clanless wastrels.  The deeper one travels below, the further one plunges into the ocean of Tekumel’s past, the Gloom Stalker (*ChusuHaladzankoi*) is master of these subterranean ruins, exploring the catacombs of forgotten empires, vast complexes of steel and vitrified stone built by the first men, and even the lost cavern-cities of pre-human Tékumel.

The Swarmkeepers (*Yu'raRa'i-kh*) are found mainly among the Pe Choi, who brought much of the insectile life of Tekumel from their homeworld.  They possess some sort of innate connection to these creatures, much like the psychic bond that unites all members of the Pe Choi race on Tekumel and beyond.

## **Rogue (*Ka’dái*)**

The Five Empires adore the epic poetry, ancient tales of stalwart warriors, pious priests and potent magicians, but no epic is as widespread, nor as popular as the Epic of Hrugga. Every culture has a hero who wins the day by their wits rather than by mere strength.  A rogue is one who has found a societal niche whose utility can only be scrupulously denied.  Within imperial palaces; spies and assassins are employed to see their lord’s will enacted, while thieves prowl within for the promise of treasure.  Barbarian tribes both sing and curse the tricksters who win the day on cunning alone or whose keen eye sees the waiting ambush when his fellows cannot.

### ***Roguish Archetypes***

*“Sweet is the harbour, but Death is the ferryman.” **\- Tsolyani proverb.***

Theft is a capital offence within Tsolyánu, punishable by impalement, with equally harsh punishments meted out in the other lands.  Professional thieves (*Yiráutokh*) are vanishingly rare, as they are either caught early in their careers or of such masterful skill that they have eluded capture for years.

As part of the ancient code of the Manifesto of Noble Deliverance, Assassins (*Hlünírtokoi*) are recognized by the Five Empires, but are formally disregarded so as to allow clients to deny any culpability.  Assassins are typically hired to remedy ignoble deeds committed against a client, though contracts of an equally ignoble nature may be denied. Such assassin clans include the Association of Relievers from Life, the Black Crossroads Society or the Clan of Whispered Fear.

Every nation makes use of Scouts (*Tsokalónkoi*) in their armies, but the Hlaka are the most highly sought after, even if they are cowardly, easily distracted, bad at following orders and relaying enemy numbers, but they can fly, which is useful. 

The Pechani and Salarvyani have a penchant for being Swashbucklers (*Arruchegar*), where it is customary for young aristocrats to settle affairs of honor in such a manner.  The merchant-princes of Haida Pakala are equally fond of this practice and are willing to pay handsomely for instruction by Arruche masters from the north.  The best school in all the Five Empires is the Conservatory of Noble Dignity, located in Tsatsayagga.

The *Vru’uneb* is the intelligence apparatus of the Livyani Hierarchy and possibly the best spy agency in all the Five Empires. Ostensibly, they are a religious society sworn to preserve the sanctity of the Shadow Gods’ mystery cult.  Their Inquisitors (*Sawarukoi*) are organized into independent cells called *pallaz*, with every member known only by their number (i.e. 5th of 20), the smaller the cell the more highly ranked it is.

## **Sorcerer (*Chágunkoi*)**

Sorcery is the common name for magic, as the finer distinctions between various spellcasters are lost on most.  All sorcerers are mutants, gifted with an innate ability to draw power from the Planes Beyond.  The fabric of reality within Tekumel’s plane is threadbare, the membrane between the worlds more porous to the flow of other-planar energies.  Over tens of thousands of years, some sophonts began to develop a psionic sensitivity to the ebb and flow of this power.  With the proper talent and training, mortal minds once limited by the confines of the flesh can shape sorcery.  	

### ***Sorcerous Origins***

The Aberrant Mind (*Ja'inHlakmekh*) are the most common kind of sorcerers on Tekumel, making up the entirety of the telepath network used to convey imperial dispatches across Tsolyanu. The weird powers they wield sometimes conjure a slimy, pinkish-white ectoplasm from the Abyss Between the Worlds.

Predating even the ancient Dragon Warriors, the *Sorokhán* are an esteemed confederation of N’luss sorcerers, traditionally of the Draconic Bloodline (*GachayaDalumikh*).  Like the Dragon Warriors of old, the N’luss respect physical prowess, but they are not fool enough to shun the power of sorcery.  Within the *Then*\-halls of N’lussa, a place of honor is set at the left hand of the *Sarq*, reserved for a representative of the *Sorokhan*.

The Cusp of Night Society is a sect within the Temples of Change, composed primarily of devotees of Hru’u, the Supreme Principle of Change and His Cohort deity, Wuru, the Many-Legged Serpent.  They employ sorcerers practicing Wild Magic (*BardanQurung*), who are considered some of the strangest and most dangerous magicians in the Five Empires, each psychically conditioned to be better receptive to the unfathomable wills of the Lords of Confusion.   

The Temple of Hnalla frequently sponsors pilgrimages for Tsolyani children in need of profound succor, bringing them to Hnalla’s shrine in Sokatis.  On certain days, a miracle occurs, sunlight shines through a window-shaft illuminating a large crystal known as the Crown of Light.  Children bathed in the multifaceted light of the crystal are blessed by Hnalla and those suffering from severe illnesses are healed.   These children often return to the Temple when they have grown up, on occasion displaying the abilities of the Clockwork Soul (*DomquoliBakh*).

###### 

## **Warlock (*Bálashkoi*)**

The priest-kings of the Engsvanyali Imperium catalogued the multitudes of powerful demons that dwell across the Planes Beyond.  Each of the gods is served by various demons and demigods; with only the great Demon Princes being powers unto themselves.  Summoning these otherworldly beings requires successfully executing complex rituals that require the proper conjunctions of the planets, precisely drawn diagrammes and appropriately prepared sacrifices, as detailed in demonological codices such as the Book of Ebon Bindings. If any of these components are misapplied, the summoner risks not only failure, but their very soul.  Demons are not always malevolent, but every last one is utterly alien in substance and essence.  Some minor heresies claim that perhaps Aspects of the gods are merely demons mistakenly given divine status; particularly citing the similarities between the demon Lady Quyove and the Livyani goddess Quyo, widely considered to be an Aspect of Sarku.

Ktelu, Who Cannot Be Gazed Upon

Demons of the Undying are grotesque beings, things of putrified substance and rotting essence.  They encompass both powerful liches lifted to demonic status and ancient neverborn spectres.

The demons known as the Spirits of Earth, Air and Water primarily serve Avanthe and are analogous to the Archfey (Tlu’um); there are fire spirits in Her service as well, but theirs is the fire of the hearth, not the flames of destruction favored by Vimuhla.

Each Circle of the Demon Planes is held by a mighty Demon Lord, beings of hideous countenance with instructable motives.  Greatest of their number are the Demon Princes, who each rule a Quadrant of the Demon Planes.  But even they are dwarfed by mighty Origob, Lord of All Creatures of the Demon Planes, with whom even the gods entreat sparingly; if ever there is cause for a warlock to enter into a pact with Origób, let it be that the Many Worlds are at risk and nothing less.

## **Wizard (*Tselinálkoi*)**

Within the Five Empires, the Temples of the Gods are the foremost institutions for learning the arts and sciences of sorcery.  Noble clans often send their youth to tutor under master magicians, familiarity with magic is seen as a sign of a well-rounded education.  Commoner clans spend their meager fortunes to see their promising youngsters learn the mystic arts.  Proficiency in magic is one of the few ways anyone of common birth can raise the standing of their clan and themselves.  Outside of the Five Empires, there are less formal means of acquiring magical knowledge, with wizards taking on a small handful of apprentices.

### 	***Arcane Traditions***

The majority of wizards of the School of Necromancy (*Sijakkanikh hiHneshtukh*) are worshippers of Sárku, Lord of Worms, whose Temple essentially invented the school, though adherents to Belkhanu, Lord of the Dead are not uncommon.

The armies of the Five Empires maintain legions of War Mages (Shatsúrkoi), each brilliant strategists schooled by the Temple of Karakan, Lord of War.

# **Book of Deeds \- Personality and Backgrounds**

## 	**Variant Alignment System \- Nobility**

*"It is ignoble to struggle against the weave of one's Skein of Destiny."* **\-Tsolyani proverb**

The principal moral conflict upon Tekumel lies between Law and Chaos, represented by the *Tlomitlányal,* the Lords of Stability and the *Tlokíriqaluyal,* the Lords of Change, who battle across the Many Worlds for the very future of the multiverse.  Every act of divine intervention is meant to steer the cosmos towards its ultimate fate.  The followers of these gods are guided by their Temples towards what virtues their deity adores and proscribed from sins they abhor, many of which lie in conflict with those of other gods. 

The gods themselves made only their desires known and made no moral commandments to follow.  Even the Scrolls of Pavar dealt mainly upon the super-phenomenal nature of the gods and had little to say about human ethics other than that the gods should be obeyed.  Each culture developed their own means to please the gods; performing rituals, making sacrifices and punishing sinners.  As such, each nation has their own ideas of what constitutes right and wrong, steeped in millenia of cultural experience.  

The ethical system pioneered by Engsvan hla Ganga and which remains instilled in the cultures of its descendants was formulated in the third millennium of the empire, by Yahéshu Sarél of Tsurú, a priest of Thumis.  He painstakingly compiled an encyclopaedia of the ethical beliefs and customs of all the nations of the empire, using it to produce his treatise on *Khómoyi* or “Noble Action”, which is still considered the standard of ethical thought today.

Noble action encompasses the concepts of *lán* (“noble”) and *bússan* (“ignoble”), to be ‘noble’ is to be honorable, faithful to one’s professed ideals and obeying the will of your deity.  Many epics have been composed that have heroes who must restrain their ambitions and choose the noble course of action, or choosing between conflicting noble actions.

To be noble, a follower of Karakan, Lord of War, must be magnanimous in victory, show dignity in defeat & deny cruelty in battle.  By contrast, a noble adherent of Vimuhla, Lord of Flame, must seize victory at all costs, avenge any defeat & destroy his enemy utterly.  Their actions are completely antithetical, but as each is following the tenets of their faith, their acts are of equal moral standing.  If one’s thoughts and deeds are aligned, the gods will honor your actions so long as you are sincere.

Society instead abhors deeds of an ‘ignoble’ nature, that is to be false to one’s ideals, to deceive others of your intentions, or to profane the will of your deity.  If our aforementioned adherent of Karakan is captured by an enemy and does not comport himself with dignity, begging for his life like a child, he would be behaving most ignobly.  Likewise, if our Vimuhla follower fails to make sacrifices of his prisoners or shows them mercy, he is committing an ignoble deed.

*“An honest tyrant is better than a hypocritical altruist.”* **\-The Pandects of Psankunel the Knower.**

	**Noble Changing** (NC) these sophonts broadly align to the Gods of Change or similar traditions within their culture. They act according to their conscience or self-interest, while acknowledging their limitations and accepting the consequences of their actions with dignity.  The Noble Changing are not always “good”, as they seldom have qualms about what is needed to further their ambitions.

	**Noble Stable** (NS) these sophonts broadly align to the Gods of Stability or similar traditions with their culture.  They act in accordance with the laws and customs of society, always stalwart in the face of adversity, and serving their lords faithfully.  The Noble Stable are not exactly “good”, as they often have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. 

	**Ignoble Changing** (IC) these sophonts nominally align to the Gods of Change or similar traditions within their culture. They act on their own whims, often hesitate in decisive situations and can be unreliable allies.  This should not be taken to mean the Ignoble Changing are “evil”, as they are keenly aware of unintended consequences and struggle with determining the right course of action.

**Ignoble Stable** (IS) these sophonts nominally align to the Gods of Stability or similar traditions with their culture, they are often uncompromising and prone to follow the letter of the law, but rarely its spirit.  The Ignoble Stable are not “evil” per se, as many question their certainties, but are disquieted by the prospect of novelty and thus keep to the familiar.

The myriad constructed languages of Tekumel.	

The Humanspace colonists who took Tekumel spoke a Tamil-Mayan-Arabic argot, which served as the *lingua franca* of their interstellar empire.

### ***Major***

#### 	*Tsolyani*

The language of Tsolyanu; the Empire of the Petal Throne and the heirs of the Second Imperium.  Due to its use by merchants and traders, Tsolyanu has traveled closely with *kaitar* coins and is spoken by humans and nonhumans across the Five Empires and even some uncivilized nations of the continent.  Like the other major languages, it is part of the Khishan language family, descended from the tongue spoken by the ancient Bednalljans with Engsvanyali influences.  It is a sophisticated language, a reflection of the Tsolyani themselves, who value exacting distinctions between social classes.  

Tsolyáni is a language with several script variants: classical, cursive, manuscript, and monumental.

##### The Tsolyani You

Tsolyani possesses over thirty variations on the pronoun “you”, each meant to be used when addressing specific persons above, equal or below one’s social station and the context they are being spoken to; i.e. *tusmiketlan* (you of polite anonymity) for tactfully addressing those whose social rank is unknown, *tsammeri* (you of heart’s desire) for addressing one’s beloved, *tusmikru* (you of courteous alienness) for addressing nonhumans of indeterminate rank, *tsamunga* (you of ultimate inferiority) for addressing slaves or lower classes in a contemptuous manner, and *srunosantusmidalidalisa* (you of supernal omnipotence) meant only for addressing the God-Emperor of Tsolyanu.

### ***Minor***

#### *Aòmórh*

The many-faceted dialects of Aòmórh are spoken in the small northeastern states, like Chayakku and uses the ideographic Kázhra VéNgakóme script.  The Aom languages have sing-song, warbling, lilting quality to them.

#### *Ghatóni*

Ghatóni is a dark and burning tongue, it is considered difficult to learn but has no written script.  Commonly the blocky Yan Koryani script is used, albeit haphazardly.

#### *Hijajái*

Hijajái is the language of Háida Pakála and several other nations across the southern ocean; several scripts are employed, all derived from Salaryváni.

#### *Jannuyani*

They speak the main dialect of Jánnuyáni and use the ideographic Kázhra VéNgakóme script.

Kilalámmuyáni speak a local dialect of Jánnuyáni and use the ideographic Kázhra VéNgakóme script.

#### *Lo'orúnankh*

#### *Milumanayáni*

Milumanayáni is a language with several mutually intelligible dialects; written either in the Tsolyáni or the Yán Koryáni scripts.

#### *N'lüssa*

N'lüssa is the intricate tribal dialects of N’lüss; written in the Mu'ugalavyáni script but not very successfully since their phonology differs greatly from that of Mu'ugalavyáni. The ancient script of the Dragon Warriors is not employed in N'lüss today.

#### *Llyani*

It is only thanks to the wondrous scholars of Engsvanyalu that the Llyani language is known at all.  The libraries of Ganga must have been filled with richer sources than what is available today, their sages somehow able to draw meaning from those squarish, blocky glyphs.  The study of the language has survived for its use in sorcery; the ancient Llyani are believed to have pioneered the great arts and magicians from across history have utilized the long-dead tongue to inscribe artifacts and write treatises.

		**Nonhuman**

Given human dominance of the continent, the impetus for learning nonhuman tongues is minimal, so the common perception is that nonhumans can learn human languages easily but that humans cannot do the same.  Foundlings raised by nonhumans can employ pidgin variants of their languages, while lacking the proper organs to convey the more subtle aspects, enough workarounds can be used for adequate communication.

## 	***Clan and Background***

Consider your choice of clan when you select a Background for your character.  Clans practice many trades that align with many of the available Backgrounds found in the Player's Handbook and other resources.  The clan is the most basic aspect of human life within the Five Empires and your clan will have an active role in your adventurer’s life.  Characters lacking the support of their clans for whatever reason will typically be viewed with suspicion.

The clans mentioned below are by no means complete, there are nearly 500 major clans and over 1000 minor clans within Tsolyanu alone, much of them founded during the Engsvanyali period, though there are older ones from as far back as the First Imperium.  The other Five Empires possess their own unique clans; 1200 in Salarvya, 1000 in Mu’ugalavya, 700-900 in Livyanu, and 850 across Yan Kor and Saa Allaqi.  Nonhumans are not forbidden from clans, but will often have their own parallel institutions meant to assist their kind in human lands.

**Acolyte** (*Kengyélkoi*) \- *Player’s Handbook* \- The priesthoods are not forbidden from having families, indeed the gods demand the continuation of a faithful lineage.  High ranking clans such as the Cloak of Azure Gems or Mighty of Gánga have had multiple generations serving the Lords of Change and Stability respectively.  Middle ranking clans such as the Golden Dawn and Moon of Evening can afford to put a good portion of their children into the priesthoods for a quality education. Low ranking clans may invest their meager resources in the hopes a promising youngster will bring status to their clan. 

**Charlatan** (*Zrafétokh*) \- *Player’s Handbook* \- Charlatanry is an extremely difficult and dangerous venture, but if one is both clever and lucky, it can be quite rewarding.  Each caste of social ranking has its own mannerism, etiquette and methods of speech.  Imitating such a wide range of these customs requires guile worthy of the ancient heroes.  In addition, the ability to forge the intricate seals of noble houses is essential, but such crimes are a capital offense.  Few clans would risk their lives and livelihoods to produce falsified documents or other such forgeries, even if they possess the skill and means to do so. Only the eponymous seal of the Kolumel-emperor cannot be replicated, it's impossible whorls and ripples speak to its otherworldly power. 

**City Watch** (*Sanléshkoi*) \- *Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide* \- Cities within the Five Empires have well-organised police forces which are technically divisions of the local army.  These include the familiar city-guards, road-guards that protect travellers on the Sakbe-roads & market police who verify weights and measures, in addition to apprehending cutpurses and counterfeiters.  The members of these constabularies can come from any of the soldiering clans, such as the Scarlet Mantle, the Eye of Flame and the Hall of Stone clans. Some clans, such as the Hand of Compassion, specialise in being prison guards and wardens for imperial dungeons like the infamous Tolek Kana Pits of Bey Su.  Tomb-guarding clans such as Black Stone Tomb, Nighted Tower & the Black Hand are hired by nobles to protect the treasures of their ancestors from grave-robbers.

**Courtier** (*Miujántokoi*) \- *Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide* \- The minor noble clans fulfill a variety of roles within the empires they serve.   A member of the Sea Blue clan is always called upon to serve in the Court of Purple Robes, the Tsolyani god-emperor’s personal advisors.  The High Pinnacle clan commonly serve as city-administrators and the White Crystal clan as bureaucrats for powerful institutions. 

**Criminal** (*Dhangótokh*) \- *Player’s Handbook* \- No clan openly flaunts their criminal connections, though rumors still cross lips. Given the punitive nature of the Five Empire’s legal systems, having a front profession is essential.  The Den of Profitable Joy makes most of their *kaitars* from their brothels and gambling dens, but skillful thievery is their true profession.  The clan is forbidden from operating within their homeland of Salarvya, but are given sanction to ply their trade in other lands, acting as spies for the Chrugilleshmu dynasty. 

**Entertainer** (*Nokáimkoi*) \- *Player’s Handbook* \- Poetry is a noble art form, equally lauded are artforms of dance, music, and storytelling.  Nobles are expected to know some form of art as part of being a well-rounded education, but professional entertainers are typically of low social standing. Clans such as Bright Sword produce musicians, poets and other entertainers, but the majority of their income comes from their weekly dinner shows and festivals.  The Standing Reed clan trains and sponsors clan-members to fight in the Hirilake Arenas.

**Far Traveler** (*TusThékutokoi*) \- *Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide* \-  Far Traveler is perhaps the most appropriate character background for Tekumel. Originally written, new players were assumed to be strangers in a strange land.  The Southern Continent is largely unknown and is home to a multitude of cultures both strange and familiar.  Other regions of the planet are likewise the origins for many adventurers; the South Pole, Benre Sa, Onmu Tle Hlektis, the Islands of the Nom, the Lands of the Tane or the Rim of White. 

**Folk Hero** (*ÁizhmuKurshéshkoi*) \- *Player’s Handbook* \- Folk heroes can come from any skein of destiny, but most clans stem from a single heroic ancestor.  The Sweet Singers of Nakomé are descended from an ancient folk hero who was given this strange nickname.  Nowadays they are mostly a clan of farmers and soldiers, but they still strive to continue the legacy of their heroic forebear.

**Guild Artisan** (*DlánmüShaukékh*) \- *Player’s Handbook* \- The vast majority of clans practice the trades that make life livable; the jewelers of the Red Eye of Dawn, scribes of the Purple Gem, leatherworkers of the Woven Whip, embalmers of the Open Sepulcher, vintners or the Weeping Stone, carpenters of the Flat Peak, barbers of the Eye of Flame, butchers of the Scarlet Planet of Knives, potters of the Glass Spear, and the armorers of the Iron Hand.  These are but a sampling of the artisan clans scattered across the Five Empires. 

**Guild Merchant (Variant Guild Artisan)** (*DlánmüDhufanúrkoi*) \- *Player’s Handbook* \-

**Mercenary Veteran** (*Thu’ínJaniyélkoi*) \- *Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide* \- Most amicable races are part of mercenary groups, supplementing human armies with their unique traits. Of all the mercenary troops of Tekumel, none can boast the most victories than the Splendor of Shenyu.  The majority Shen band is sung as a model of martial prowess and nobility across all the Five Empires.  They honor all vows, but are clever enough to outwit their ignoble friends and foes.  The Splendor of Shenyyu always returns home only once in seven years and always before the enigmatic holiday called “the Contemplation of One’s Eggs”.

**Noble** (*Horúkoi*) \- *Player’s Handbook* \- There are lineages within clans whose ancestry includes kings and emperors of ages past.  These include the “Lich Lords'' of clan Íto, the hereditary masters of the Chakas; the Vríddi clan of Fasiltum, perennial thorn in the side of the Petal Throne; the Golden Sunburst, descended from Engsvanyali nobility.  And of course, there is the Tlakotani, the imperial clan of Tsolyanu.  Noble clans trade in both favor and coin, as well as maintain vast holdings of land farmed by lesser clans. 

**Outlander** (*Dhaipüntokoi*) \- *Player’s Handbook* \- Many clans practice trades that take them far away from the villages and cities where their clients live.  The hunters of the Scarlet Planet of Knives venture into the wilderness for game, returning home with fresh meat for the butchers of their clans.  The Turning Wheel clan make a modest living transporting goods, in addition to building and maintaining Chlen-carts.  At any given time, at least half of the humble Polished Stone clan is abroad, keeping the *Sakbe*\-road network clean.  The Standing Reed clan is descended from a band of N’luss warriors who ventured into Tsolyanu as mercenaries and have made a name for themselves as roughneck bodyguards ever since.

**Sage** (*Kusijáktokoi*) \- *Player’s Handbook* \- The prestige of the Amber Cloak clan was built on the authority of its scholars.  Their treatises are meticulously researched, if a bit long-winded and given to archaic prose.  By contrast, the Scroll of Wisdom’s works are more accessible to the commoner clans, given their reputation for impartiality.  The apothecaries of the Staff of Beneficence often serve as the personal physicians to nobility. 

**Sailor** (*Lazhá’tokh*) \- *Player’s Handbook* \- The Blazoned Sail clan are the widest ranging clan in the Five Empires, with clanhouses found at every port.  There are smaller clans that specialise in fishing, such as Green Malachite, whose sailors are their equal in skill and bravery.  The Red Flower clan are merchants who sail to foreign lands to trade their wares. The islanders of Tsolei are infamous pirates, as are the privateers that guard the coasts of Shenyu. 

**Soldier** (*Chàngadéshakoi*) \- *Player’s Handbook* \- Since an honorable military career is a popular means of bringing status to one’s clan, soldiers can come from any clan.  But there are an abundance of soldiering clans within and without the Five Empires.  The Scarlet Mantle clan is better known for their servants, but they also accompany officers into the battlefield. Blade Raised High is a proud warrior clan descended from the place guard of the Engsvanyali priest-kings.  

**Spy (Variant Criminal)** (*Púrjintokoi*) \- *Player’s Handbook* \- In the second millennium of the Engsvanyali Era, the priest-king Atlkólum II, known as "The Omniscient", founded the first system of secret police, informants and spymasters that would become the forerunners of Tekumel’s contemporary intelligence agencies; the Tsolyani Omnipotent Azure Legion, the Yán Koryáni *Surgéth*, the Mu’ugalavyáni Mourners in Sable, and the Livyáni *Vrú’uneb*.

**Urban Bounty Hunter** (*Chanrágukh*) \- *Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide* \- Despite its low social standing, the Collar of Bronze clan is wealthy enough to rival the moneylenders of the Copper Door clan.  It is only due to their ignoble profession as slave-catchers that they are not counted among the elite clans.  The Collar of Bronze and other slaver clans prowl the underbelly of society, capturing criminals, clanless waifs (*nakomé*) and destitute foreigners to fill the pens of slave markets in the Five Empires and beyond. 

**Urchin** (*Nakomé*) \- *Player’s Handbook* \- Some very low clans are so poor they are unable to maintain every clan member within; some, to save coin, push the less useful out onto the streets to try and make a living; some are removed from the clan entirely, for no wrong of their own.  To be clanless is a truly pitiful affair, but to survive and thrive as *nakomé* requires strength to rival steel. The rise to greatness from such humble origins is itself a feat worthy of the epics.

Broad outlines of historical empires and civilizations of Tekumel, with prehistory being left vague. 

## **Recorded History**

### 	***The Empire of Llyán of Tsámra***

*“...in the days which came after the Latter Times.*” **\-The Tablets of Llyan**

By most accounts, the near-mythical Llyani Empire is considered the dawn of history upon Tekumel.  Known only by scattered artifacts found beneath some of the oldest cities on the planet, the most prominent of which are the leaves of imperishable gold called the “Tablets of Llyan”.  These tablets describe the civilization of one Llyan of Tsamra, a soldier-adventurer turned king, listing the provinces and cities that Llyan brought into his empire, whose capital was Tsamra, much like his Livyani descendants.  Many of these names are now meaningless to modern readers, the locations lost to time and the meanderings of language.  

The other artifacts from this era are even less enlightening; Livyanu and her neighbors are littered with fragmentary walls of perfectly cut stone, circles of crumbling monoliths built upon conical hilltops and peasants often unearth shards of red-glazed pottery while tilling their fields.  Adventurers that journey into intricate circular labyrinths under the most ancient cities of the region return with heavy gold coins stamped with an image of a naked man bearing a wand or sword of some kind.  Archaeologists and other scholars are more interested in the statuettes of unnamed gods or the lonesome golden scrolls and tablets which always provide more questions than answers.  The arts of sorcery are thought to have been codified during this age and many magitechnological devices of the Great Ancients often bearing Llyani etchings instructing bearers of their use.

###### 

###### 

### 	***The Three States of the Triangle***

The Triangle is assumed to have been contemporaneous with the Llyani Empire or perhaps arose shortly after its collapse, the exact duration of this period is nearly impossible to place.  Virtually all records of the Great Triangle comes from outside sources, notably their conquerors, the Dragon Warriors, though much insight can be drawn from ancient records kept by Shenyu, if one dares to enter their labyrinthine libraries.  Artifacts from this era are sometimes dredged up from the Mssuma river delta but are difficult to identify, it is believed the Great Triangle was less an empire and more of a confederation of various nations or tribes within the region, each with unique cultures. The city-states that served as three capitals: Urmish, Jakalla and Thraya; are some of the oldest cities in the world.  Each has been rebuilt countless times across the millennia, sweeping away more history than could ever possibly be learned. 

### 	***The Dragon Warriors***

“*Flying upon brazen wings...armoured as though with iron...slaying with tongues of flame…*” **\-Fragments of an ancient N’luss epic, unknown title**

Spurred by a visitation from the Lord of Flame, a roaring horde of bloodthirsty conquerors burst forth from the desolate mountains beyond Mu’ugalavya.  The Dragon Warriors were the fearsome ancestors of the N’luss, named for the terrible beasts they rode upon to plunder the soft and rich lands of the south.  The nature of these “dragons'' is a matter of perpetual dispute by historians, N’luss epics are notorious for their grand embellishments.  Popular thought has vacillated between them being living creatures akin to the reptilian Sro or a flying machine of the Great Ancients of prehistory or perhaps even demon servitors summoned from some distant plane.

The reign of the Dragon Warriors was brief and bloody, quickly sweeping through the southlands, their merciless advance halted only by the Shen, who proved to be more than a match for the fiery reavers.  Seeking easier prey, the Dragon Warriors turned east, burning a swathe across the continent until they were halted once again by the enclave of Ssuyal, home to mankind’s oldest enemies.  Overextended by nearly two hundred years of constant warfare, the Dragon Warriors finally lost momentum and began consolidating their nascent empire.  The squalid city of Malchairan rose with proud towers and its red robed shamans became the new theocratic elite, henceforth becoming the Dragon Lords. At the height of its power, a thousand captives a day were sent into the fiery embrace of “The Cupped Hands of Flame'', the great furnace built to honor their patron god, Va’am.  Merely five centuries after the first invasions, the Empire of the Dragon Lords began to fragment and disintegrated entirely over the next thousand years from petty wars, blood feuds and self-serving greed. 

### 	***The Fisherman Kings***

As the Dragon Warriors tore themselves apart, a new power was rising in Salarvya.  The long suffering peoples united behind a minor lordling named Gamulu, reclaiming their metropolises and driving out the decadent heirs of their conquerors.  Celebrations were brief though, for the dreaded Ssu had also chosen this time to reclaim their ancestral lands, thus began the terrible Ssu Wars.  For over 25 years Gamulu fought the Great Enemy, the tides of war ebbing back and forth, brokering an alliance with the skittish Hlaka, the Ssu destroying cities so ruthlessly they  would never rise again and Gamulu himself losing many sons, but eventually the foe was driven back into the deep labyrinths beneath the wastelands of Ssuyal.   

Gamulu reigned only for a decade before succumbing to a wasting disease contracted during the final campaigns of the Ssu Wars.  The following succession crisis saw the deaths of Gamulu’s remaining children until the youngest son, Ho Etehltu, claimed his father’s Ebon Helm with bloody hands.  This newly minted dynasty henceforth became known as the “Fisherman Kings”, named for the fleet of small, swift galleys Ho Etehltu and his descendants used to terrorize the southern seas, seizing many island nations and coastlines.  

During the reign of the 22nd Fisherman King, the Lord of Secrets provided a visitation to the realm and began to be worshiped under the name Enome. The black-robed priesthood began to challenge the Gamulu Dynasty, until a delicate balance of power was held.  Salarvani legends claim that the Black Robes could tailor life as the Great Ancients once did, curing disease and creating monstrosities in equal measure, though Salarvyani legends are also known for their fanciful elaborations.  Over the next half millennium, worship of the other Lords of Change began to take hold, though they would not be recognized as the same pantheon until much, much later.  These visitations would create strongholds of worship that persist to this very day; Sarku in the forests of Do Chaka, Dlamelish becoming the favored deity of Jakalla, and Hru’u in the lands surrounding the ruined city of Hmakuyal.  The last of Gamulu’s bloodline, the 55th Fisherman King, died transfixed to the Ebon Throne by a hundred slender blades, betrayed by simpering courtiers eager to curry favor with the invading armies of Queen Nayari.  The Bednalljan tyrant had promised them each an ocean of treasure and rewarded their loyalty by having them hurled from the frowning battlements into the sea.

### 	***The First Imperium \- the Bednálljan Dynasties***

*“Nothing truly glorious is attained through moderation.”* **\-Bednalljan epic, unknown title**

Despite the carnage sown by their founder, the Bednalljan Dynasties provided nearly three thousand years of order and stability.  Few could challenge Bednalljan supremacy, the early empire hungrily consumed its former rivals and the Dynasties spent the remaining centuries shrewdly improving their power-base.  Perhaps the most enduring mark of the Bednalljan Dynasties are the extensive *Sakbe-*roads, the network of mighty fortified highways that span the Five Empires.

Culture flourished under the First Imperium, the Dynasts were fervid patrons of the arts and local customs developed in sophistication, forming the bedrock of traditions yet to come.  Missionaries ventured forth into uncivilized lands, bringing back the first glimpses of far-off realms beyond the edge of the known world.  Humanity became reacquainted with the myriad sophonts of Tekumel and grew accustomed to some, while others stirred profound dread.  Trade pacts were made with shadow-hushed Livyanu and smaller states like eastern Salarvya, which maintained a precarious independence.  The Bednalljan Dynasties beget good kings and bad, conquerors and cravens, sages and fools, but always persevered against the tumults of the age. 

#### *Queen Nayari of the Silken Thighs, Royal Mistress of Purdanim and Jakalla and the Myriad Cities of the South*

*“A desert beast in search of water…”* **\-The Royal Courtesan of Love, Pagarta Nemandu**

Any discussion of the Bednalljan Dynasties must involve the legacy of its founding mother, the notorious Queen Nayari of the Silken Thighs.  A legendary figure of countless skills, Nayari employed intrigue, war, poison, sorcery, assassination and pleasure expand her empire, each to marvelous effect.  

Born of uncivilized nomads from the Dry Bay of Ssu’um, Nayari was barely a woman when her father sold her into concubinage.  Traded like a pretty bauble between the lords of the south, she learned many arts and sciences outside that of her profession, eventually becoming First Concubine and later Chief Wife of the Clanmaster of Purdanim, a city long-lost beneath the Mssuma river delta.  From her new position, the cunning Nayari slowly and methodically consolidated her power until every one of her former masters was slain, finally taking vengeance on her ignorant husband.  The old man was sealed alive, naked and alone within the shrine of Mshékh, the much-feared Goddess of the Pale Bone. Thus began the bloody reign of Queen Nayari, once merely a waif, who would become the most powerful woman of the glittering cities of the southlands.

Marriages of alliance brought new city-states under her banner and the sudden deaths of her husbands cemented her position.  Her unification of rag-tag militias into a model fighting force that pioneered military formation, with modern princes and generals still studying her genius stratagems. Ravenously power-hungry and absolutely merciless, when the old nobility of Purdanim roused the masses to rebellion, Nayari put her own capital to the sword, building a mountain of skulls in the city square.  Her name is still used to frighten children into obedience across the Five Empires.

Nayari was undone by the very game she perfected, poisoned by the lips of a young lover, who in turn died in the act.  Her children fought briefly, but it was her son by the murdered lord of Tumissa, who prevailed against his siblings to claim the throne.  Ssirandar the First publicly renounced his mother’s cruelties and spent his reign unifying and rebuilding the wearied empire.

### ***The Golden Age \- The Ever-Glorious Empire of Éngsvan hla Gánga***

The tiny, inconsequential island of Ganga was barely of interest to the First Imperium, its inhabitants being merely a tribe of impoverished shellfish gatherers.  Here dwelt a crippled priest called Pavar, who would soon shake the very foundations of the world and usher in a glorious golden age.  Though a worshipper of Enome, the Bednalljan incarnation of the Lord of Secrets, Pavar made first contact with the beings he would later name the Lords of Stability.  Hither came wise Thumis, mighty Hnalla, generous Avanthe, golden Belkhanu and finally, lordly Karakan; each bringing a great revelation that opened new avenues of thought to the lowly priest and soon after, the world.  

Ever the dutiful scribe, Pavar recorded the encounter in detail and even included passages of his own conjectures on the matter.  The Scrolls of Pavar spread far and wide across the Bednalljan Imperium, stirring the hearts of the common folk who had long suffered under the auspices of the regime and the old faiths.  The quiet island of Ganga swelled with pilgrims and students eager to learn at Pavar’s feet and at the time of his death many years later, the lands surrounding his modest hut became a bustling metropolis.  Great temples were erected in honor of the new gods and missionaries traveled the empire to sing their praises and whole cities were converted almost overnight.  The priests of the old religions waxed wroth and their inquisitors sent many innocent souls to gruesome ends, but ultimately could not staunch the bleeding of their cults.

Nine hundred years after Pavar’s death, the cults of Stability and Change brokered a tenuous peace, former backwater Ganga was the center of secular and religious power, the last Bednalljan king had fled northwards past the islands of Yan Kor and the reign of the priest-kings began.  Under their rule, prosperity and civilization was introduced to the dark corners of the northern continent, many lands and peoples were brought into the empire and became Engsvanyali, occasionally by conquest, but mostly by voluntary conversion.  It was impossible to doubt the empire had the blessing of Gods themselves, for the priest-kings possessed the means to call upon their Lords freely.  Wisdom flourished under their guidance, great sorceries were wrought and even the otherworldly devices fashioned by the Great Ancients of prehistory gave up their secrets.  As omnipotent theocrats, the priest-kings very word was law, at their very whim, armies of naked slaves would toil nonstop for decades on carving vast tableaus into  cliff-faces, expanding the *Sakbe-*roads into new acquired territories or transforming an entire mountain into a mighty fortress-palace, many such works of wonder still litter the continent.

For nearly ten thousand years, the Engsvanyali Empire reigned, its borders expanding and contracting at times, but always dynamic and never stagnating like civilizations of prior ages.  For a time it seemed like the Empire of Engsvan hla Ganga had forever been and would rule forevermore, but like thunder on a cloudless day, a great cataclysm wracked the planet; mountains crumbled, seabeds heaved to the surface and the great island of Ganga half fell into the ocean.  To this day, the cause of the cataclysm is unknown, most believe that overabundance of sorcerous power was to blame, but few can ignore the likelihood that the Pariah Gods had some hand in its destruction.

### ***Time of No Kings***

The fall of Engsvanyalu left a deep wound upon the world, the planet itself was in turmoil, the great northern sea drained away, leaving the islands of Yan Kor landlocked, in the eastern seas of Salarvya, a new continent rose out of the waves, only to sink below again mere centuries later.  The Time of No Kings was said to last at least five millenia, but the exact duration of this lawless age is unknown, as countless minor disasters continued to wrack the land, stymying the best efforts of chroniclers attempting to make sense of their new world.

Despite the danger, the Time of No Kings was an age of incredible possibility, every day brought novel opportunity and unknowable dangers.  The power vacuum left by the Kingdom of the Gods roused hundreds upon hundreds of petty despots to style themselves omnipotent emperors of all the world.  Great heroes strode the lands, forming the basis of many folk-legends sung by poets and peasants of the modern age; there are few within the Five Empires who have not heard tales of such luminaries.  The warrior-sage Hagarr of Paranta, the arrogant necromancer Nyelmu, the serpent-headed Chirene of N’luss, clever Qiyor the Many-Tongued, and the bumbling Turshanmu, Summoner of Demons.

Less celebrated, but still notable examples include the nigh-immortal sages of the Undying Wizards, the Blasphemous Accelerators, who sought to defy the gods themselves and the intelligent beasts and half-breeds of the Company of Less-Than-Men, and countless other heroes of legend across the world. 

### ***The Second Imperium \- Empire of the Petal Throne***

Out of the tumult of the Time of No Kings, the secrets of prehistoric Tekumel were returned to the world once again.  The last of the minor disasters unearthed vaults of the Great Ancients unseen since the Time of Darkness, each promising troves of powerful magitechnology.  Enterprising parties ventured forth into these complexes, the vast majority perishing to automated defenses, but the survivors claiming treasures enough to purchase an empire.

The name of the founding emperor of the Tsolyani Imperium is lost to time, he is known only by his clan-name, “the Tlakotani.”  Much of how he came to conquer the petty states of the age is unknown, though he doubtlessly had an army of supporters, a stronghold near present day Bey Su and certain magitechnological marvels that allowed him to plant the seeds of a powerful empire.

Across the continent, ambitious tyrants swept away their rivals and consolidated power using similar means.  In Livyanu, the Hierarchy of Tsamra finally put down the last revanchist elements from the Dynasty of Thirty Swords.  After fruitlessly warring amongst themselves for centuries, the Four Palaces of Mu’ugalavya united under the Scarlet Banner and turned their warmongering outward.  The landholders clans of Salarvya began to knit together the intricate web of favors and vassalage that created their feudal empire.  Much later, the warlord known as “the Iron Fist of the Peaks'' conquered the petty city-states of the north, giving rise to the modern nation of Yan Kor.

The Great Ancients remain a source of mystery and wonder to even the mightiest of god-kings and the great sages of antiquity.  What artifacts that remain of their bygone age, however miraculous, are merely trinkets compared to what the Great Ancients were truly capable of.  

### ***The Humanspace Era***

By the 61st millennium, the Milky Way galaxy was home to an ever-expanding interstellar civilization, it had as many names as it had languages, but was commonly known as Humanspace.  Humanity had survived near-extinction and feeling invincible, a confederation of space-faring powers from Central America, North Africa and South Asia took to the stars. Initial expansion into the galaxy was slow, colonists traveling in vast generation ships, Humanspace engineers learned how to make machines that could last the millenia-long journeys with minimal repairs.

In time, Humanspace explorers made contact with the Pe Choi, who gifted them the Three-Light Drive, accelerating their exploration of the Sidereal Universe.  Crossing paths with dozens of other sophonts, what began as a mission of peace and exploration gradually evolved into one of greed and conquest with the ascension of the Dynasty of the Veritable Autocrator.

At some point, the planet that would become Tekumel was discovered, it was an ugly, putrid little world with yellow skies and endless bogs filled with purple fungus.  Ordinarily, this kind of world wouldn't be worth setting foot on, but the star system lay at the confluence of several interstellar trade routes. Tekumel wasn’t ideal for colonization, but Humanspace had experience with terraforming worlds, the only real difficulty would be the native sophonts.  The Hluss had a burgeoning spaceflight program and the Ssu pioneered directed energy weapons, but with such primitive technology, they were only able to resist the conquest of Tekumel for a century.

With the locals dealt with, Humanspace planetary engineers could begin their work unmolested.  The crust was split open and great eternal engines sunk into the core to regulate the planet’s gravity, orbit and rotation to Earth-standard parameters.  The oceans of mud were drained and filled with clean water, the mouldering skies scrubbed and made palatable to breathe, and specially formulated chemicals sprayed over the surface to poison the planet’s ecosystem.  Every continent and coastline was terraformed to suit the planet’s new masters and a subterranean transit network dug to ferry visitors to various regions across the planet.

Graciously altering the planet’s atmosphere to such a degree that Tekumel's native life-forms could still survive, the Dynasty of the Veritable Autocrator provided reservation zones for the autochthonous sophonts, allowing them the dignity of dwelling on their homeworld.  Elsewhere, garden parks were planted, recreating the most beautiful locales of Humanspace member worlds.  Opulent pleasure palaces rose upon the coasts, built with materials imported from distant star systems, housing the galactic elite and their servants.  The wealthy and powerful from across the galaxy descended upon Tekumel to enjoy its tropical climate and luxury resorts.

### ***The Time of Darkness***

This state of affairs persisted for centuries, the indigines fruitlessly tested the defenses of their reservations, but only spores of purplish vegetation could escape, providing but a mild annoyance to Tekumel’s vacationing guests. Unbeknownst to all, the constant arrival and departure of starships by way of the Three-Light Drive had dangerously weakened local space-time.  An anomaly was quietly building at the barycenter of the star system, just below the threshold of reality, where even the most advanced sensors could not pierce. 

Without warning, the entire Tekumel system, including the planets and everything within reach of the stellar gravity well plunged from the Sidereal Universe into a pocket dimension of pure nothingness.  The fall was not gentle, as the delicate web of electromagnetic forces that held celestial bodies in equilibrium was severed, every world was subject to profound calamities.  The sun guttered, mountains crumbled, seabeds heaved to the surface, glittering orbitals fell from the skies, and the stars winked out forevermore.

###  ***The Latter Times***

Those calamitous days are now remembered only in myth, as survival took precedence over posterity, with humanity and other sophonts struggling to rediscover agriculture and other skills employed by their distant ancestors.  The sophonts that populated Tekumel began to explore, settling in biomes most like their lost homeworlds and the planet’s autochthonous inhabitants rushed to slip their prison-colonies and retake their homeworld.  As the centuries became millenia, the spectre of extinction began to recede and the promise of rescue seemed farther still.  

Gradually, even the most commonplace technologies of the bygone age began to degrade without engineers to maintain them.  Miraculous, once reliable machines fell silent one-by one as the millenia wound on.  The only ones that remained were those machines that were self-repairing or designed to last the ages, such as the eternal engines at the core, still beating to the rhythm of the planet.   Such devices were regarded with wonder by survivors and jealously coveted by the so-called Lords of the Latter Times.  These sorcerer-scientists  took advantage of the unique properties of the thin reality, using its permeability to construct devices that pulled power from other planes, ushering in a whirlwind of magitechnological advancement that Tekumel will likely never see again.  At the height of their power, the Lords of the Latter Times reached near-deific status before departing Tekumel for the Planes Beyond, leaving the rest of the planet’s inhabitants behind.

# **Mitlányal \- Gods of Tékumel**

*“Yea, the Gods exist\! Deny the Gods and perish\! Obey the Gods and prosper\!”* **\-First Verses, Scrolls of Pavar**

Tékumel has its share of mighty warriors, powerful emperors and wise sages, but none have had more of an impact upon the world than that of a crippled, impoverished priest from a small, inconsequential island.  The priest called Pavar made contact with the *Tlomitlányal*, the Lords of Stability.  By his categorizations of the gods, Pavar laid the foundations for the worship and rituals used by the Temples.  Each of the individual deities of the *Tlokíriqaluyal*, the Lords of Change, made contact with Tékumel prior to their counterparts.  By the time of Pavar, each had complex religions and thousands of worshippers at their disposal.  

Each of the ten major gods are served faithfully by their Cohorts.  Compared to their Lords, the Cohorts are minor gods, but each of them is all-powerful within their Domain and command legions of other-planar servitors.  Each Cohort could be considered a reflection of their Lord focused towards a particular facet of their Domains. But theologians have debated the exact relationship between the Lords and their Cohorts for millennia and there are as many schools of thought on the subject as there are branches on a tree.

It should be noted that the gods of Tékumel are not truly deities as imagined by the common man, but interdimensional entities of phenomenal power and a desire for worship.  Ultimately a distinction without a difference, but useful information that both powerful heroes and players should know.  Pavar categorized them into the rival pantheons of Stability and Change, describing each god as an enemy to one and an ally to another.  The exact relationships between the gods is a mystery and these seeming allegiances can be questioned, as the gods appear to cooperate with their ostensible foes at times, mingling their essences to form composite deities.  As creatures of mere flesh and blood, mortals are ill-equipped to fully grasp the magnitude of beings who contain worlds within themselves.  The only certainty known is that the gods are highly active and bear interest in Tekumel; as virtually everybody knows someone whose lives have been impacted by divine intervention.

The gods below are the original Éngsvanyali (and later Tsolyáni) pantheon, but other nations have their own cultural variations, including different names.  As the mortal perception of the gods is also subject to the whims of syncretism and cultural shifts, each nation has made their own assumptions of the god’s character based upon their cultural history with the deity.  Further muddying the waters of mortal interpretation, each god possesses multitudes of Aspects, specific manifestations they use to adopt other Domains; each considered a minor deity of their own and worshipped appropriately.  A single god could conceivably populate a religion’s entire pantheon entirely with their own Aspects.

## **The Temples of the Gods**

The Temples of Change and Stability are major presences within the Five Empires; each possessing vast holdings, contributing to public works and their faithful employed in vital industries like agriculture, education and the military.  Their secular authority is not uniform, some are subservient to local leadership and must compete with rivals for influence, while others are regional powers unto themselves; equivalent, if not greater than the imperial governors they ostensibly swear fealty to.  Regardless of stature, the Temples are important players in every community; owning vast tracts of farmland, collecting tithes and serving as loci of education, commerce and politics.

The Temples of the Lords, the major gods of Pavar’s pantheon, have palatial shrines in every major city and smaller shrines in countless rural villages.  Typically, a wing of these shrines are set aside for the priests of the Cohort deities, but on occasions they possess a separate complex of their own.  Every settlement in the Five Empires has shrines to each of the twenty gods, regardless of the theological leanings of the rulership.  Even foreign gods, with their strange rituals and delightful heresies, are welcomed without prejudice.  One would find it easier to tear the planets from their moorings in the sky than to prohibit the worship of any particular god\!

## **The Concordat**

Established long ago, in the early days of the Engsvanyali Empire, the Concordat forbids open warfare between the Temples of Change and Stability.  In addition, the Temples are prohibited from prostelization or other aggressive means of increasing their power, instead having to rely on political and other secular means of influence.  Though the bones of the priest-kings who originally penned the Concordat have long since become dust, the cultural inertia of Engsvan hla Ganga endures into the age of the Five Empires.

The Concordat remains honored by the Temples of Change and Stability, outwardly at least. Though both curry favor and leverage with princes, kings and emperors; the Temples conduct their intrigues and fight proxy battles on the outskirts of civilization.  This “cold war” is fought with everything between the choosing of emperors in the halls of power to mercenary adventurers in the Underworlds.  The most lenient punishment for violators of the Concordat is typically a lengthy anchorage within their Temple’s dungeons, but each priesthood has its own unique means of ensuring compliance with the Concordat.

Religious conversion is also protected by the Concordat, though it cannot do anything to quell any social scorn this may incur. The Temples each have their secretive inner teachings to protect and make converts start anew as acolytes, regardless of their rank in their prior faith.  Revealing the inner rites of a Temple to another, even a friendly Temple, is considered a violation of the Concordat.

### ***Avánthe***

*Lady of Heaven, Mother of Devotion, Goddess of Fertility*

Whenever night turns to day or winter to spring, whenever fruit ripens or a maiden flowers, whenever fish swim upstream or birds fly northwards, Avanthe is there.  It is She who turns the wheel of the seasons, who tells the rivers to flood in spring and makes crops ready for harvest in autumn.  As the Lady of Heaven, Avanthe maintains the cycles of the natural world necessary for life to flourish.   She is commonly depicted as Hnalla’s consort, though this is merely a mortal interpretation of the relationship shared between these supernal beings.   Though Hnalla may be the King of the Gods, His domain is largely esoteric; and it is Avanthe who is more widely worshipped, as Her domain is more impactful to mortal lives.  Even adherents to the Lords of Change call upon Avanthe when their crops fail or drought comes to their lands; leaving offerings of blue flowers or incense at Her shrines.  Though there is no doctrine requiring it, animal sacrifices are commonly made in Her name; but woe be unto those who defile Her shrines with the blood of a living sophont.

#### *Temple of Avanthe*

Avanthe’s priesthood wear robes of cerulean, Her sacred color, or likewise dust their skin with light blue powder.  Priestesses commonly go bare-breasted to symbolize the goddess’ bountiful nurturance, though full nudity in Her priests as well is not uncommon.  Both decorate their bodies with sapphires and other blue gemstones, together with delicate golden bracelets, rings and coronets.  Members of Her priesthood are active in their communities; presiding over births and marriages, tending to the sick and infirm, or conducting planting and harvest rituals.  The fertility rituals of Avanthe are joyous affairs, where scores of young lovers are bidden to take their dalliances to fields yet to be sown.  The children born from such unions are said to be favored by the Lady of Heaven.  The Temple of Avanthe works closely with the priesthood of Ketengku to operate countless hospitals across the Five Empires.  Avanthe calls mortals to be respectful stewards of the world, so the priesthood also produces excellent textbooks on agriculture, animal husbandry and veterinary medicine.

#### *Aspects of Avanthe*

Lady Avanthe has 93 known Aspects; Her idols portray a matronly woman with a kindly, but wise expression upon Her wizened face.  The three most popular of Her Aspects are known as the Three Sisters: the youngest is E’eth of the Rains, who brings precipitation to water fields; Quyela, the middle sister, makes crops, animals and people fertile, mate and bear offspring; and the eldest Chikuna, the Ripener, oversees the harvesting of crops and the births of newborns.  Other Aspects include Elulaiku, the Purveyor of Excellent Alimentation, patron of cookery and the name of Pondu, Keeper of Scales, is invoked at the opening and closing of marketplaces, His role being the patron of commerce.  Even Her most fearsome Aspects have benign purposes; the spidery Halel, Servitor of the Forlorn, plays matchmaker and helps parents select names for newborns; while the fanged, bestial warrior Varemu, Protector of the Small, brings retribution to those who would abuse children and animals. For some unknown reason, the 28th Aspect of Avanthe was expunged from the catalogues composed by reverend scholar Priestess Teshkorusa, who lived shortly before the end of the Engsvanyali Era.

The Lady of Heaven is known by many names across Tekumel, She is worshipped as a great mother goddess across the world.  Avanthe is merely Her Tsolyani name, to the Yan Koryani She is Gaghnat and the Mu’ugalavyani call Her Awedha.  In Salarvya, She is considered simply an Aspect of the great goddess Shiringgayi and in the days of the Engsvanyali priest-kings, She was known as Evuen.  The Livyani worship Kirrinéb, a goddess of nature whose bloody sacrifices rival that of any war god.  Before its annexation by Yan Kor, the small nation of Pijena was ruled by the priesthood of She Who Is Not Seen, the local incarnation of Avanthe.

### ***Belkhánu***

*Lord of the Dead, Master of the Paradises of Teretané, Opener of the Gates of Heaven*

Compared to the other Lords of Stability, the Lord of the Dead, Belkhanu, is not as widely worshipped.  Much of His concerns are with matters beyond this world; the habitations of the dead and the Planes Beyond.  To those who dwell upon Tekumel, He grants peace to those near death, solace to the grieving, and defends against the depredations of the undead and otherplanar demons.  Through Belkhanu, adherents of Stability are guided along the paths of the afterlife, from the Isles of the Dead to the Paradises of Teretane, and ultimately to apotheosis within Hnalla’s Perfect Light.  Belkhanu desires mortals to journey from one life to the next in orderly procession, each incarnation purifying the spirit-soul until it can rejoin the source of being.

#### *Temple of Belkhanu*

The priesthood of Belkhanu dress in robes of golden yellow, with tall headdresses and gauzy veils to hide the face. His Temples are never at rest, at every hour cantors join and depart from the Perpetual Choir, singing the songs of worship while funerals and other rites are performed.  It is difficult to tell when one ceremony ends and another begins, moving from one chamber to another, the pageantry representing the spirit-soul’s journey from one life to another across the planes.   The Temple of Belkhanu is consulted, albeit rarely, on matters dealing with Planes Beyond and its denizens.  Nothing is kept secret, but discussing such esoteric subjects without some foundational understanding of the Many Worlds makes for fruitless conversation. 

Across the Five Empires, the Temple of Belkhanu are entrusted with the funerary arrangements of every class and even those of other faiths occasionally.  Only the Temples of Vimuhla and Sarku prefer to handle their own dead in their customary manners.  Most if not all of the Temple’s funding comes from donations given for the embalming and interment of the dead, as well as selling various charms and amulets for mourners.  While Belkhanu has no desire for sacrifice, His priesthood has a reputation for salesmanship, providing a variety of supplemental services yet another small donation.  That said, they are not mere swindlers, the *kaitars* they gain from the funerals of richer clans subsidize the costs of the poor and clanless.

Funeral customs vary according to nation, race, and class, often with regional and doctrinal differences as well; but generally the corpse is embalmed with a waxy gauze and interred in a sepulchre befitting the deceased’s social status.  All such tombs, crypts and graves are temporary, as per the doctrines of Belkhanu, they can be reused once the corpse within has gone to dust and the memory of the deceased has faded away.

#### *Aspects of Belkhanu*

Lord Belkhanu has 67 known Aspects and His idols commonly depict Him as a four-armed humanoid with a round, featureless head.  Each hand bears an Insignia of Paradise; a yellow gem, a staff, a bowl and an orb of gold.  The Aspect known as Tronua appears to the grieving as a kindly old man or woman, giving sage advice and comfort before departing mysteriously. Those wishing to travel bodily into the Planes Beyond seek the counsel of Mriso, the Knower of the Planes or that of Hayekka, Cartographer of the Planes.  Hettashte, the Ferryman, navigates the Isles of the Dead, providing passage to souls in search of paradise. His most fearsome Aspect is Doluel, Guardian of the Tombs, which protects bodies from desecration, though cares not for grave goods.

The Lord of the Dead is known by many names across Tekumel, He is invoked whenever an excellent soul has passed from this world.  Belkhanu is merely His Tsolyani name, to the Yan Koryani He is Búlkh and the Mu’ugalavyani call Him Bo'olkón; in the days of the Engsvanyali priest-kings, He was known as Ba'álk.  The Livyani worship Ndárka, known as the Resurrected One, whose doctrines somewhat resemble those of Belkhanu.

###### 

### ***Chegárra***

*The Hero-King, Swordsman of Glory, Cohort of Karakan*

Courage is noble, but wisdom is its ally; Chegarra the Hero-King serves His Lord, Karakan, by drawing mortals to great acts of courage.  Recklessness is the sign of a fool, but shrewdness in the face of fear is a mark of greatness. Kings and commoners alike worship Lord Chegarra, as He is the patron of armies and of statecraft.  Just kings pray to Him for guidance, soldiers for valor, and plebeians for good rulership.

His priesthood dress in scarlet and white chequered robes, with ceremonial armor made from silver, gold and bronze.  They operate schools of statecraft across the Five Empires, where the political acumen of students is raised by analyzing historical events and consulting vast libraries of treatises on rulership.  The clergy is highly active in local and national politics, advising village headmen and governors, with higher ranking members keeping the counsel of kings in matters of military and imperial. 

The Hero-King is known by many names across Tekumel, He is worshipped by all who value wise rulership.  Chegarra is merely His Tsolyani name, to the Yan Koryani He is Chkár and the Mu’ugalavyani call Him Kigársh; in the days of the Engsvanyali priest-kings, He was known as Chökhár.	

###### 

###### 

### ***Chiténg***

*Drinker of Blood, Reaper of Cities, Cohort of Vimuhla* 

Chiteng is the embodiment of bloodlust, the cruelty of destruction without any of the mystical facets of His Lord, Vimuhla.  Marshalling the armies of Change across the Many Worlds, Chiteng is a zealous foe of Stability and always first to meet them in battle. Though His home is the battlefield, Chiteng can be found wherever deeds of wanton savagery are performed.  His only desire is to foment societal violence enough to sate the appetite of His Lord between conflagrations.  He is a simple deity to please, aiding any who revel in carnage, plunder and brutality.

The priesthood dresses in robes of vermillion and dark purple, wearing full sets of armor and helmets wrought in iron.  Their stranglehold in the Five Empire’s meagre iron trade, though scarce and poor of quality, is the source of their fortunes. Their ceremonies are lavish affairs, more akin to a festival; great pyres are made with perfumed wood and sacrifices hurled into them while attendees feast and drink.  Sacramental meat is prepared, supposedly symbolic of human flesh, and consumed in ritual cannibalism.  Aristocrats drink spiced liquors made from cacao, hot, frothing and deep red, meant to resemble blood. The laity of the temple are drawn from the soldiery clans of the Five Empires, in particular police, prison guard and executioner clans.

The Drinker of Blood is known by many names across Tekumel, He is worshipped by any who yearn for the thrill of mortal combat.  Chiteng is merely His Tsolyani name, to the Yan Koryani He is Khtæn and the Mu’ugalavyani call Him Kténgish; in the days of the Engsvanyali priest-kings, He was known as Chanákh.   

###### 

### 	***Dilinála***

*The Lovely Maiden, Solace to the Weary, Cohort of Avanthe*

While Avanthe is the mother goddess, Her Cohort, Dilinala, embodies women in every other facet they can be.  She is the innocent girl, the loving daughter, the loyal sister, the *Aridani* warrioress, the wise crone, the clan-matriarch and the omnipotent empress; all lie under the blessing of Dilinala.  Though mothers also receive Her blessing, Dilinala is generally unconcerned with domesticity or motherhood.  Her interests lie instead upon the expansion of the powers of women in society and protecting them from the evils unique to womanhood.  

Her all-female priesthood wears robes of blue and white, while men can worship Dilinala and often do, they cannot be initiated into Her cult and are forbidden from witnessing the Temple’s inner mysteries.  As Dilinala is a virgin goddess, the priestesses of Dilinala are forbidden from intimacy with men, many take comfort with women instead or simply remain celibate.  The priesthood works hand in glove with their counterparts in the Temple of Avanthe and as Dilinala is the patroness of women, the priesthood maintains women’s shelters, gynecological and obstetric clinics.  The Temple of Dilinala also operates martial academies with curriculums designed to take advantage of the feminine physique and how to cultivate the respect of men under their command.

The Lovely Maiden is known by many names across Tekumel, She is worshipped by all who celebrate the power of women.  Dilinala is merely Her Tsolyani name, to the Yan Koryani She is Dlénel and the Mu’ugalavyani call Her Di'ila; in the days of the Engsvanyali priest-kings, She was known as Dhalé.

###### 

### ***Dlamélish***

*Lady of Pleasures, Mistress of Demons, the Obsidian Princess of Lubricious Delights*

The world is a different place with every blink of the eye, as Change affects every moment.  To Dlamelish, these moments are to be savored, each unique and shall never again come to pass.  She adores the brief, bright moments of mortal lives as they flicker in the dark depths of time.  Her doctrine is that of hedonism and excess; Her followers are bidden to indulge themselves in everything from epicurean delights to sybaritic carnality.  Mortal life is one of toil and suffering, any opportunity for pleasure must be seized, regardless of its cost.  The militant hedonism of Her worship has brought lands to prosperity and ruin in equal measure.

#### *Temple of Dlamelish*

The priesthood of Dlamelish paint their skin emerald green or wear lascivious vestments of the same color.  Silver is also favored by the goddess and Her clergy commonly wear argent jewelry or bracelets and anklets with tiny silver bells.  The doctrines include a series of tantric rites known as the 34 Unnatural Acts, each a sensual gratification of otherworldly pleasure enough to reach the Dlamelish Herself.  Their orgiastic ceremonies are held at night when the moon Gayel is visible, sometimes involving the sacrifice of eels or other snake-like creatures with obsidian knives.  The secretive inner rituals involve sacrifices of beautiful youths and maidens to demons summoned from the Planes Beyond.

There are no brothels or other such dens of iniquity within the Five Empires, for the Temple of Dlamelish caters to every vice.  One need only visit Her shrines and provide a donation, then a temple prostitute will be summoned to suit your tastes.  In addition, the temple courtyards are marketplaces for luxury goods, where one can find the latest fashions as well as jewelry, cosmetics, and perfumes.  Fine liquors from and other pharmaceutical diversions are also available for purchase, with an emphasis on aphrodisiacs, save for the deadly *zu’ur*, of course*.*  The Temple’s interests in keeping these luxuries in supply makes them an outsized presence in international trade.

#### *Aspects of Dlamelish*

Dlamelish has 101 known Aspects; Her idols are cast in silver and depict either a voluptuous maiden or an obese crocodile-headed woman, but always with green gems for eyes.  She is portrayed as dancing upon a dais supported by a menagerie of demonic suitors and surrounding the image is a tableau of phallic, yonic and other genital symbology.  Lovers pray to either Ma’asha of the Ecstatic Union or Dletara, Goddess of Reflected Pleasures, or even both, depending on their proclivities. Drunkards and brewers alike pay tribute to Arko’ela, the Lady of the Joys of Drink, whose ample bosoms are said to flow with divine liqueurs.  Gamblers pray to Meshmura of the Divergent Skeins for luck in their games, Her mendicant priests are bidden to gamble away their possessions.  Daredevils and other thrillseekers invoke the name of Shu’ure, She of Grand Exhilaration, before they embark on their escapades.  Regardless of their outward  faith, cooks across the Five Empires pray to Goriku, the Gourmet, His corpulent idol displayed prominently in their kitchens.  The most esoteric Aspect of Dlamelish is Med’da, the Aspect of the Ultimate Now, whose idols move and change when not observed.

The Lady of Pleasures is known by many names across Tekumel.  She is worshipped by any who wish to slake their desires.  Dlamelish is merely Her Tsolyani name, to the Yan Koryani She is Tlóm and the Mu’ugalavyani call Her Dlóma.  In Salarvya, She is considered simply an Aspect of the great goddess Shiringgayi and in the days of the Engsvanyali priest-kings, She was known as Tyalméya.  The scurrilous Ghatoni believe that Iyach, the goddess of the green moon, castrated their sun god, Ghe.

### ***Drá***

*The Uncaring, Singer of the Hymns of the Gods, Cohort of Hnalla*

The material world is an illusion, a tawdry distraction from the true essence of being, the Eternal Light of Hnalla.  Dra is a mystical deity, as His purview lies in the denial of the physical world in favor of the perpetual witnessing of Hnalla’s perfection.  The Uncaring is not a particularly popular god, His sublime indifference makes a challenging case for worship.  His One Task is endlessly singing the Hymns of Hnalla within the Halls of Paradise and does not involve Himself in the affairs of other deities.  Dra rarely performs acts of divine intervention and is characteristically sloppy when He does deign to provide assistance.  A plea worthy of drawing the gaze of Dra can only be made to alter the destiny of the world. 

The priesthood of Dra wear robes of white and tan, though the true ascetics of the sect wear no clothes at all. Much of the day to day operations of the Temple are handled by acolytes, while the senior clergy practice forms of sensory deprived mediation.  Their physical needs are tended to, being fed, bodies cleaned and moved about so they may be free to seek the unattainable perfection of Dra without interference. The monumental ascetics called the Perfect of Dra are said to be able to subsist entirely on mist.

The Uncaring is known by many names across Tekumel and is worshipped by those seeking enlightenment into the true nature of being. Dra is merely His Tsolyani name, the Mu’ugalavyani call Him Trekhúishin and in the days of the Engsvanyali priest-kings, He was known as Dhré.  As mentioned before, He is not a particularly popular god and is virtually unheard of in Yan Kor.  The distant, nameless god of the insectile Tinalya bears a certain similarity to that of Dra.

###### 

### ***Durritlámish***

*The Black Angel, Opener of the Catacombs, Cohort of Sarku*

Though Sarku promises immortality in undeath, it is His Cohort, Durritlamish, who is responsible for the fulfillment of that promise.  He protects and shepherds the undead, so that they may join His Lord at the End of Time and bear witness to the victory of Change.  He aids those who protect necropoli and gruesomely punishes any who would desecrate corpses.  His association with ancient catacombs makes Him master of the Underworlds, guardian of the secrets of long dead civilizations buried under the weight of time.

The priesthood wear robes of earth brown and darkest purple, bearing ornamentation of copper, commonly painting their skin gray to resemble a corpse. The laity of Durritlamish provide much of the labor force of the funerary industry, from tomb police to gravedigger clans. Despite the limitations of death, ancestral clan-members are active in the affairs of their modern descendants, thanks to the vigilance of the Temple of Durritlamish.

The Black Angel is known by many names across Tekumel, He is worshipped by those who dwell in the Underworld; undead, mutants and tomb-worker clans.  Chegarra is merely His Tsolyani name, to the Yan Koryani He is Kéreshm and the Mu’ugalavyani call Him Tórmuish; in the days of the Engsvanyali priest-kings, He was known as Do'oróm.

### ***Grugánu***

*Knower of Spells, Black Sword of Doom, Cohort of Ksarul*

Within the demiplane known as the Blue Room, Ksarul sleeps, His power contained, but not subdued.  Watching over the prison of His master, Gruganu meticulously tests its ten walls and ten gates, probing for weaknesses.  Gruganu is the patron god of magicians and of science and technology; He has followers across the Many Worlds searching for the ten keys or other such power that could possibly open a path into the place which is not a place.  

The priesthood of Gruganu wear robes of black and purple, accented with silver jewelry.  They tend to be less interested in deliberate obfuscation than their counterparts in the Temple of Ksarul, with lies of omission being their preferred means of preserving an advantage.  The Temple’s midnight ceremonies are grand spectaculars, depicting legendary tales in mime and dance.  Vast libraries of magical treatises and studies of ancient technology lie under the temple’s protection, even the means of breeding mutants like the ancients once did.  Their expertise in uncovering lost and forgotten things makes them ideal for solving mysteries.

The Knower of Spells is known by many names across Tekumel, He is worshipped by any who would learn the secrets of sorcery.  Gruganu is merely His Tsolyani name, to the Yan Koryani He is Krúgh and the Mu’ugalavyani call Him Kru'ugáish; in the days of the Engsvanyali priest-kings, He was known as Göghün.

### ***Hnálla***

*The Supreme Principle of Stability, the Lord Whose True Name May Not Be Known, the Illumination of All the World*

As the Supreme Principle of Stability, it is Hnalla who emanates the very forces of law and being into the multiverse.  He is both the source and the fate of the cosmos, each of the Lords of Stability works to bring the Many Worlds into His Perfect Light.  Hnalla aids any who would establish sound institutions or preserve the continuation of a rightful order.  Though much of His domain is given to metaphysical concerns of causality and the ontological, He is still worshipped by nobility and commoners alike as the King of the Gods.  His followers would claim that their Lord has already won the Great Conflict, as all of creation wears the form and substance given unto it by Hnalla, and Hru’u can only make meaningless alterations.

#### *Temple of Hnalla*

The priesthood of Hnalla wear vestments of purest white adorned with plates of silver polished to a mirror shine.  Diamonds and other pure, transparent crystals are also favored as symbolic of Hnalla’s orderly perfection.  Much of His ceremonies take place outdoors or in well-lit chambers, where pure sunlight can be caught by these gemstones and refracted into a scintillating spectrum of colors.  The priesthood is seemingly forever occupied with rituals great and small, as they conduct grandiose rites for major holidays, the ascension of royalty and obscure doctrinal purposes, in addition to six daily rites to glorify Hnalla at dawn, midmorning, noon, afternoon, dusk and evening.  Hnalla shuns blood sacrifices, but accepts offerings of white flowers, clear crystals such as diamonds or quartz and white stones.  Fasting is commonplace, but only as penance for ignoble actions, these can be as simple as swearing off sweets to consuming only water for days.

Much of the Temple of Hnalla’s secular interests lay in public works, advocating for the upkeep of the *Sakbe*\-roads and the dredging of rivers, contributing much of the funding needed for such projects.  The Temple also is heavily invested in logistics and trade, they are often first to notice disruptions in shipping lines and the troubles that could foretell.

#### *Aspects of Hnalla*

Lord Hnalla has 51 Aspects, most of which manifest in the abstract rather than as tangible creatures or persons; His symbol is displayed in temples rather than some imperfect idol.  One of His more humanlike Aspects is Bajan Ke’un, worshipped in Tsolyanu as the Guardian of the Imperium and Patron of its Armies, He appears as a stern-faced old soldier bearing a mighty sword.  The Aspect known only as the Crown of Light appears within the crystalline refractions of Hnalla’s temples, shining like a miniature sun, healing sick children that are brought into Its presence.  The Aspect called Markhom, the Master of Transcendent Contemplation, which manifests only as a otherworldly voice that posits riddles of an existential nature.

The Supreme Principle of Stability is known by many names across Tekumel, He is worshipped by all who desire social order and security.  Hnalla is merely His Tsolyani name, to the Yan Koryani He is Ghól and the Mu’ugalavyani call Him Hnéluish; in the days of the Engsvanyali priest-kings, He was known as Nallal.  The Livyani worship the Shadowed One, whose doctrines resemble those of Hnalla.  The Saa Allaqiyani revere Him as the all-mighty Lord of Light, His priesthood being the de-facto rulers of the nation.

###### 

### ***Hriháyal***

*The Dancing Harlot, Mistress of the Five Worlds, Cohort of Dlamelish*

Like Her Lady, Hrihayal indulges in the sensation of the moment.  But while Dlamelish exults in the heights of physical pleasure, Her Cohort pushes past them into the unknown and unexplored.  To worship Hrihayal is to dance upon the razor's edge between pleasure and pain, if to live is to suffer, then it is a noble act to relish all of its exquisite suffering.  Enjoy the pain of existence while one still can, mortal life is temporary and the spirit-soul is granted a new sensorium as it migrates to its next life; one may never again feel the rhythm of blood coursing through veins, the scrape of muscle over bone or the delicate alchemy of one's own entrails.

The cenobites of Hrihayal wear robes of emerald green and darkest purple, intricately scarring themselves with obsidian and piercing their skin with silver needles, though simpler piercings are not uncommon.  Virtually all torturer clans within the Five Empires are adherents of Hrihayal, gamblling clans are also frequent worshippers as Hrihayal is the patroness of their trade.  Unlike their fellows in the Temple of Dlamelish, asceticism is frequently practiced to experience the deliciously unique pain of deprivation.  To advance in the clergy, one must undergo the 34 Unspeakable Acts, each a ritual torture of such sublime atrocity to draw the attention of the Hrihayal Herself.  Her temple's inner rituals are performed upon daisies of filthy stones within the sewer systems beneath the ancient cities of Tekumel.

The Dancing Harlot is known by many names across Tekumel, She is worshipped by all who would explore the further regions of experience.  Hrihayal is merely Her Tsolyani name, to the Yan Koryani She is Rélth and the Mu’ugalavyani call Her Hréla; in the days of the Engsvanyali priest-kings, She was known as Hráil.

### 	***Hrü’ü***

*The Supreme Principle of Change, Dispenser of Calamites, the Lord of Confusion*

As the Supreme Principle of Change, it is Hru’u who emanates the very forces of chaos and possibility into the multiverse.  He is both the source and the fate of reality, each of the Lords of Change works to bring the Many Worlds into His Ultimate Dark.  Hru’u is the raw power of creation, a font of unfettered generation that builds as it destroys.  Let Lady Avanthe have Her turning of the seasons, let Lord Belkhanu have His procession of death and rebirth, Hru’u cares not for these gentle transitions. The Supreme Principle of Change wants unceasing chaos, random and unpatterned, seething without reason like water in a cookpot.  He aids those who would bring change to the world, no matter if it be for altruistic or selfish purposes, as long as the existing status quo is reformed, corrupted or brought down, He is pleased.  Hru’u’s power extends across the planes and into the fullness of time, sowing seeds that bloom and ripen and twist together like a creeping vine.  Only with the benefit of hindsight can one see the hidden connections between disparate events that led to such tumult.

#### *Temple of Hru’u*

Much of Hru’u’s theology is esoteric, dealing with matters of coincidence, uncertainty and the unknowable chaos that underlies a seemingly placid reality. His temples are labyrinthine, with chambers adjoined by Y-shaped corridors, representing the infinite branches of possibility.  To advance in the priesthood, initiates must walk these branched paths to pray at the shrines of certain Aspects of Hru’u, taking the wrong path could lead to a dead end or a hidden trap.  The priesthood of Hru’u clothe themselves in innumerable ritual costumes of deep purple; each is unique, accessorized with feathered plumes, demon masks, and ornamental regalia, chosen by blind chance.  His ceremonies always take place on moonless nights, when the sky is naught but velvet darkness.  An odd number of priests are summoned and directed by their superiors to perform impressively theatrical rituals, sometimes culminating with a living sacrifice, the purpose of which, if any, is unknown.

The Temple of Hru’u is wealthy and well-connected, owning vast amounts of farmland and having the support of many agricultural clans.  But the principle service the Temple offers to society is graft; by brokering its influence in exchange for coin and favors, the priesthood can shake up established institutions, providing the means for newcomers to enter.  In addition, the Temple of Hru’u are proud advocates of *Ditlana*, the ritualized form of urban renewal practiced across the Five Empires.  Generously funding the razing and rebuilding of entire cities and being highly involved in the planning and executing thereof.

#### *Aspects of Hru’u*

Lord Hru’u possesses 78 known Aspects; His icons commonly depict Him as a bulbous, featureless orb from which eight arms extend, each bearing some symbol of His power.  As befits the Lord of Confusion, many of His Aspects seemingly act against each other.  No mortal can know the mind of a god, let alone the Supreme Principle of Change, but what end does it serve Hru’u to war against Himself?  Appearing as a great toad-like beast with bronze teeth, Kaishma, the Lord of the Deep Purple Dark, is considered a martial Aspect, but more accurately represents change by force.  Within the seas of Time and Space dwells Shiggeth Cha, the Swimmer, who resembles a deathly pallid fish with pupiless eyes, He is invoked to take persons to forbidden places.  One of the more recently discovered Aspects is Kankubel, the Muck-Eater, who first appeared almost five hundred years ago and introduced some stimulating heresy into conventional Temple theology.

The Supreme Principle of Change is known by many names across Tekumel, He is worshipped by any who long for revolution and reform.  Hru’u is merely His Tsolyani name, to the Yan Koryani He is Grü'óth and the Mu’ugalavyani call Him Hre'ésh; in the days of the Engsvanyali priest-kings, He was known as Khéri.  The Livyani worship the Horned One of Secrets, whose doctrine resembles that of the Lord of Confusion.  The small states of the northeast call Him Heshuel, He and His brother, Aridzo, fought bitterly over their father’s patrimony, but whichever son was the winner forms much of the religious strife in the region.

### ***Karakán***

*Lord of War, Master of Heroes, High General of the Gods*

The cosmic struggle between Stability and Change requires warriors of renown and first among them is Karakan, the Master of Heroes.  He serves Stability by defending its adherents from the forces of Change, aiding those who show courage and honor in warfare, and those who fight to defend society.  Karakan’s doctrines revere martial prowess, the power of the imperial state and its expansion; though warfare is by nature chaotic, Karakan wields its powers of change to further the goals of Stability.  Do not mistake Karakan for His bloodthirsty counterpart, for war is a means for the preservation of society, not wanton destruction and pillaging.

#### *Temple of Karakan*

The priesthood of Karakan dress in costumes of bright red, accented with gold; bearing arms and armor both of ceremonial and utilitarian design.  His shrines are built like fortresses, with vast armories and parade grounds where acolytes train under the tutelage of martial arts masters.  Rituals have the appearance of military drills, accompanied by trumpets and great bronze war-drums.  Unlike the other Lords of Stability, Karakan does not prohibit blood sacrifices and prefers that of war-captives, humanely executed by a sacrificial knife to the heart.  A victim who approaches the altar with dignity, singing their Death-Song proudly is considered a fine sacrifice.

The Temple of Karakan operates some of the finest military academies in the Five Empires, clans often send their most promising young warriors to study under their masters.  There they receive training in all the “noble” weapons; daggers, swords, axes, polearms, bows and crossbows; anyone who learns arms other than these is considered an eccentric.  In addition, the Temple of Karakan administers the Hirilakte Arena circuit, performing the opening and closing ceremonies, and refereeing the duels to ensure the honor of the combatants is preserved.

#### *Aspects of Karakan*

Lord Karakan has 56 known Aspects, He is commonly depicted as warrior-youth with the head of hawk, winged and armed with shield and sword.  Artillerists and sappers make offerings to Orkutai, the City-Destroyer, who appears as a great three-headed bird of prey.  Nonhuman warriors favor the worship of the six-limbed serpentine Aspect called Rayeshtu of the Many-Swords. The *Aridani* warrior women of Karakan’s priesthood model themselves upon the image of Faishan, the PInnacle of Victory, who is depicted as an armored woman carrying lightning bolts.  All valorous and honorable warriors are greeted at the entrance to paradise by a cube of red stone, the form of Morsa, the Doom-Singer.

The Lord of War is known by many names across Tekumel, He is worshipped whenever one needs to take up arms to defend clan and country.  Karakan is merely His Tsolyani name, to the Yan Koryani He is Krékku and the Mu’ugalavyani call Him Karkánish; in the days of the Engsvanyali priest-kings, He was called Kerék.  Though the carefree islanders of Tsolei would seem to have little need for it, they invoke the name of the warrior god Chro when defending their homes from pirates.

### ***Keténgku***

*The Many-Eyed, Physician of the Gods, Cohort of Thumis*

The Cohort to Lord Thumis, Ketengku embodies the practical application of wisdom in everyday life.  He is most notably the patron of physicians, but also aids alchemists, scholars, and all others who would use their knowledge to benefit society.  In His capacity as Physician of the Gods, Ketengku unifies the purviews of Thumis and Avanthe, though He heals more than just ailments, He also restores damages wrought by the Lords of Change.  In this way, Ketengku makes the world right again, allowing it to rejoin its proper course towards the Eternal Light of Hnalla.

The priesthood of Ketengku wear robes of grey and white, sometimes accented with blue.  They make up the majority of physicians and healers within the Five Empires, employed at the hospitals of the Temple of Avanthe.  Naturally, His Temple also operates medical academies, with specialized schools for the care of particular ailments; geriatic medicine, congenital defects, chronic illness and so on.  By the tenets of the Temple of Ketengku, any who come to the priesthood in need must be cared for impartially; foreigners, nonhumans, and even adherents of the Lords of Change.  

The Physician of the Gods is known by many names across Tekumel; He is worshipped by all who would learn to care for ailing.  Ketengku is merely His Tsolyani name, to the Yan Koryani He is Kútkæn and the Mu’ugalavyani call Him Kténish; in the days of the Engsvanyali priest-kings, He was known as Kátén.

##### Lament to the Wheel of Black

*“A facile tale, facilely told.”* **\-The Harper, from the Lament to the Wheel of Black**

The epic poem called the *Lament to the Wheel of Black* tells the story of the Battle of Dormoron Plain.  At first it was simply a battle between the Lords of Change and the Lords of Stability, one of countless similar engagements fought across the Planes Beyond.  But the youngest and most ambitious of the gods, Ksarul, saw the opportunity to supplant both Hnalla and Hru’u as supreme Godhead of the cosmos.  Outraged by such betrayal, the remaining nine gods banded together and with the aid of the One Other, defeated the Lord of Secrets.  They imprisoned Him in a demiplane known as the Blue Room, locking the ten gates and scattering ten keys across Tekumel.

### 	***Ksárul***

*Lord of Secrets, Doomed Prince of the Blue Room, the Rebel of the Gods*

Some secrets are too dangerous to be learned, but others are best kept until the revelation of which might be more advantageous.  The Lord of Secrets of a god of knowledge, but of that which is only known by a few.  Ksarul aids all who would learn to further their ambitions, who would seek that which should not be known and those who keep the mysteries of the world.  Though much of His power is hindered from within the Blue Room, Ksarul still has means to work His will across the multiverse. His followers search for the ten keys that will release their lord from the Blue Room; the Temple already has one, but given their predilection for hoarding magical artifacts, they may be in possession of another unwittingly, yet another is thought to be among the treasures kept in the Palace of Bassa, King of the Ssu.

#### *Temple of Ksarul*

The priests of Ksarul wear robes of black, accented with indigo and silver ornamentations.  The priests commonly don silver masks and priestesses wear those made of expensive black Tiu-wood, shaped in the visage of Ksarul’s serene, smiling face.  The central doctrine of Ksarul’s theology are the Mysteries, initiates are introduced to deeper revelations upon reaching higher ranks within the priesthood.  His ceremonies always take place at night, with separate rituals conducted as the darkness falls and rises, the faithful offering small statues  depicting Ksarul made out of blue clay, stone or sapphire.  Rarely, blood sacrifices are needed during specific conjunctions of the planets, but these are only performed as part of the Inner Mysteries.  The Temple employs a secret language known to outsiders as the Tongue of Ksarul, taught only to those initiated into the priesthood, not even the laity knows the meaning of their prayers.    

The Temple of Ksarul present themselves as excellent members of the community; tithes are paid punctually, servants are well-treated and are often the first to give aid in times of distress.  Given the nature of the faith, ulterior motives are expected, but the Temple are good neighbors by pragmatism, so long as they do nothing to arouse the ire of the authorities, they are left to further their ambitions in peace.  Like their counterparts in the Temple of Thumis, the priesthood of Ksarul operates private schools across the Five Empires; teaching philosophy, history, languages and the sciences.  In addition, advanced courses in the schools of magic are available to the faithful.

#### *Aspects of Ksarul*

Lord Ksarul has 62 known Aspects; His idols depict Him as a young man in recline as if in slumber, a staff topped with His symbol clasped in his crossed hands and a serene smile across His lips.  Those who wish to puzzle out some device of the Ancients or create a new spell call upon Ey’un, the Knower of Skills, He manifests as a gaunt humanoid creature that possesses an ovoid head with indistinct features.  Conspirators invoke the name of Gorrugu, Master of Black, to prevent discovery, hide from foes and assist in escapes.  The dreaded Qol revere the serpent-headed Chopruna, the Dweller in Shadow, patron Aspect of mutants and inhabitants of the Underworld.  Similarly, the hunchbacked Te’ekuna, the Wanderer Below, assists in the navigation of the Underworld, but not without an appropriate offering of black flowers and silver.

The Lord of Secrets is known by many names across Tekumel, He is worshipped by those who wish to learn forbidden secrets. Ksarul is merely His Tsolyani name, to the Yan Koryani He is Kshór and the Mu’ugalavyani call Him Ksoruélish; in the days of the Engsvanyali priest-kings, He was known as Jráka.  The supreme deity of the Livyani pantheon, Qame’el, resembles Ksarul and other Shadow Gods approximate some Aspects, though the Livyani will not confirm if they are truly one and the same.  The ancient Bednalljans once knew the Lord of Secrets as Enome, the priest Pavar was an adherent of His before the fateful visitation of the Lords of Stability.

###### 

### 	***Qón***		

*The Ancient One, Guardian of the Gates of Hell, Cohort of Belkhanu*

Lord Qon assists Lord Belkhanu by protecting the spirit-soul as it journeys towards its ultimate destiny in the Hereafter.  For the living, He defends the world from incursion by malefic demons from the Planes Beyond.  Qon eases the burdens of the living and the dead, so that they may fulfill their Skein of Destiny without interference.  He aids any who would frustrate the designs of demons, the Lords of Change or the dreaded Pariah Gods.

The priesthood of Qon don robes of white and yellow, and commonly wear veils or masks fashioned in the canine-like image of Qon Himself.  They are extremely furtive for adherents of the Lords of Stability, said to possess secret techniques for fighting demons and keeping whole libraries of sealed tomes accessible only to those initiated into their inner doctrines.  Though they contribute to the services of the Temple of Belkhanu and possess eclectic interests in agriculture, pharmaceuticals and transport, the source of the majority of their funding is unknown.  If pressed on any of the aforementioned matters, the clergy will cryptically state they are sworn not to reveal anything beyond the visible.

The Ancient One is known by many names across Tekumel, He is worshipped by all who would defend this plane from outsiders.  Qon is merely His Tsolyani name, to the Yan Koryani He is Ækön and the Mu’ugalavyani call Him Aqónish; in the days of the Engsvanyali priest-kings, He was known as Khúan.

###### 

### ***Sárku***

*Lord of Worms, Master of the Undead, the One Who Comes Forth From the Tomb*

Much as the corpse decays, returning to the dust from which it was made; so must the Many Worlds decay until it is yet again seething primordial chaos. Sarku is the embodiment of that entropy, the inexorable dissolution of all things into their original essences.  His tenets hold that life is but a momentary spasm before the eternal stillness of death and offers His faithful immortality as the undead.  Sarku’s methods seem almost antithetical to Change, given that He provides the means to preserve one’s identity after the expiration of the body, sealing their minds within their corpse-shells forevermore.  But the undead are not immune to Change, indeed within the cold fire of entropy they shall experience the decomposition of their own bodies, slowly shedding the taints of life as they bear witness to the crumbling of ages yet to come.  In breaking the cycle of life and death, Sarku further spreads decay across the Many Worlds. 

#### *Temple of Sarku*

The priesthood of Sarku dresses in robes of rich brown, much like grave-dirt, accented with bone-white trim.  Their ornamentations are always made from copper, a metal sacred to Lord Sarku, so much so that the Temple holds a monopoly on the copper trade in the Five Empires.  The faithful also possess a method of forging copper harder than iron, the secret of which is held jealously in their cold, deathly grip.  Their copper jewelry is often inlaid with topaz, amber or ivory carved in the appearance of skulls. The clergy also paint their faces to resemble grinning skulls and wear skull headdresses.  Ceremonies are held at night within subterranean shrines below the temple and often involve blood sacrifices or other unspeakable rites.

The faithful gather in these catacombs on holidays and are reunited with their undead loved ones, let loose from their crypts in a joyous, yet grotesque parade.  Not all adherents are given the blessing of undeath, only those who dutifully serve the Lord of Worms in life may be allowed to continue their devotion in undeath.  Moreover, only Sarku can judge how much of their faculties the undead are allowed to retain; most are little more than walking shells called *Mrur*, while some retain varied portions of intelligence, like the ghoulish *Shedra*.  Only a rare few are blessed enough to become *Jaigi*, who are as perfectly lucid as they were in life.  Ancient myths speak of even greater undead given the honor of attending the Lord of Worms Himself.

The priesthood contributes to the funerary traditions of the Five Empires by building and maintaining the necropoli that house the dead. While most cemeteries are built outside of their communities, each region has its own customs; riverside settlements build the necropolis on the opposite bank, some are catacombs built into the shallow layers of the Underworld, and the greatest necropoli are akin to small cities themselves.  

#### *Aspects of Sarku*

The Lord of Worms has 108 known Aspects; His idols depict a great worm with five heads wreathed in tentacles, each with a gaping maw.  A common bogeyman is Siyenagga, the Wanderer of Tombs, who patrols cemeteries across the world, destroying tomb robbers and trespassers. Worshipped off the coasts of Salarvya, Msheqw, the Bloated One of the Sea, appears as a giant drowned corpse and may wreck ships that do not placate Him with copper ingots.  Appearing as an aged, skeletal woman, Albel, the White-Haired Woman of Doom, is prayed to by clan-parents who have lost daughters, in the hopes She would make *Jaigi* out of them.  Oghur, the Restorer of Bones, wanders the battlefields of the Far North, collecting disembodied limbs and rejoining them to their bodies, so that they may be raised as undead.

The Lord of Worms is known by many names across Tekumel, He is worshipped by any who wish to live forever.  Sarku is merely His Tsolyani name, to the Yan Koryani He is Su'úrkh and the Mu’ugalavyani call Him Gyu'úmish.  He is worshipped in the Salarvyani city of Tsa'avtulgu as Black Qarqa and in the days of the Engsvanyali priest-kings, He was known as Qúrgha.  The Livyani worship the Quyo, Mistress of the Grave, whose doctrines vaguely resemble those of Sarku.  The Pakalani worship Lady Sarqa and Her five sisters, who represent the different kinds of death that can befall mortals.

### ***Thúmis***

*Lord of Wisdom, Knower of Arts, Sage of the Gods*

The Lord of Wisdom was the first of the Lords of Stability to contact the crippled priest Pavar.  Before his conversion, Pavar was an adherent of Ksarul, Lord of Secrets, but Thumis saw not a hoarder of knowledge, but a teacher without students.  One warm midsummer evening, Thumis appeared to Pavar and Tekumel came into the influence of the Lords of Stability.  Though recently, archaeologists have uncovered evidence that some Aspect of Thumis may have been worshipped as early as the age of the Dragon Warriors\!

Hoary Thumis forever seeks to expand knowledge, in both the understanding of the universe and the teaching of others.  His doctrine preaches that society is strengthened by literacy, wisdom, and reason; ever-bright candles that illuminate the darkness brought by ignorance and secrecy.  The Lord of Wisdom is patron deity of scribes, physicians and philosophers; aiding all who would study the unknown and reveal its mysteries to others.

#### *Temple of Thumis*

Priests of Thumis dress in robes of pearly grey, often with the trim patterned with the Eye of Thumis.  Jewelry is uncommon, but is typically of silver inlaid with pearls.  The principle doctrine of the clergy is the “Perpetuation of Sagacity”; that society benefits from the exchange of knowledge.  To this end, the Temple operates schools for every stratum of social class, with the expressed goal of fostering literacy, but also languages, mathematics, philosophy and history.  In addition, there is always a library or museum on temple premises, where visitors can enjoy untold generations of fruitful scholarship.  Further, certain temple complexes contain observatories or other scientific workshops where in-depth research can be performed. To advance within the priesthood, every acolyte must complete an act of devotion, some research project that expands the knowledge base of the temple. 

#### *Aspects of Thumis*

Lord Thumis has 47 known Aspects, modern Temples icons depict Him as a seated, scholarly man crowned with a golden halo, bearing a book-roll in one hand and an Bednalljan Staff of Power in the other, which is something of an anachronism.  One of Thumis’s more famous Aspects is Armesh, the Jeweled Serpent, who protected the folk hero Hrugga from the demon Qu’u, known as He Who Would End Wisdom.  The normally cool and collected Temple of Thumis becomes particularly agitated when the Aspect called Nrash, Observer of All the World, sends forth one of His ineffably sublime visions, with various factions each attempting to puzzle out its meanings, sometimes coming to blows over the matter.  Students burn incense in honor of Tyelu, She Who Guides, for assistance in passing exams.  The most grotesque Aspect taken by Lord Thumis is that of Meshmur, the Healer of Entrails, physicians seek guidance from this cyclopean serpent for the treatment of cancer and other maladies of the organs.

The Lord of Wisdom is known by many names across Tekumel, He is worshipped wherever knowledge is valued.  Thumis is merely His Tsolyani name, to the Yan Koryani He is Dhárm and the Mu’ugalavyani call Him Tu'úmesh; in the days of the Engsvanyali priest-kings, He was known as Thám.  The grim warriors of Pechano call him Tsomeq, for they find that knowledge is the greatest weapon needed to fight their implacable foe, the Ssu.

###### 

### ***Vimúhla***

*Lord of Flame, All-Consuming One, the Blaze Contained*

The flame purifies as it destroys; much as new growth appears after a forest fire, so too must the Many Worlds be reborn in cosmic conflagration.  Vimuhla is that flame, burning away all matter and substance until there is naught but pure, raw energy.  Existence is pain, per His doctrines, but within the purifying heart of the inferno there is catharsis.  The Lord of Flame embodies sudden, catastrophic change; He is associated not only with natural disasters, but also the death-urge, the portion within every soul that yearns for violence.  His destructive appetites are so great that Vimuhla must be constrained; the Lords of Change bid Him to unleash His ecstatic flame only when it is necessary to their goals, lest He destroy their victories as well as their enemies.  Historically, Vimuhla was first of the Lords of Change to contact Tekumel, and would have reduced the world to a sublime cinder had the other Lords not taken notice.  

#### *Temple of Vimuhla*

Following the example of their Lord, His adherents practice a doctrine known as the “Flowering of the Flame'', kindling and feeding the flame of zeal within their souls, strengthening it until circumstances allow for its ecstatic release.  It is quite disconcerting to see Vimuhla’s clergy exult in carnage and devastation when they otherwise appear self-possessed.  Most of His followers are average people, perhaps more inclined toward martial endeavours, who go about their day without engaging in any atrocities.  Of all the gods, Vimuhla is the most hungry for blood sacrifice; be it from beasts, war-captives, or slaves, it matters not, so long as blood is spilled.  Over ten thousand souls are cast into the firepits of Vimuhla every year within Tsolyanu and even more in Mu’ugalavya, where His worship is predominant.

The priesthood of Vimuhla wear robes of vermillion, with headdresses and ceremonial armor fashioned into the image of flames.  Ornamentation is of red-gold shaped into stylized flames inlaid with garnets, rubies and other red gemstones, the flame opals of the Chakas being the most prized.  Ritual scarification is common, with some devotees burning marks into their flesh with red-hot brands.  The Temple is highly involved in the military industries of the Five Empires; their faithful clans forge weapons, fashion armor, and build fortifications, as well as contributing a sizable portion of the soldiery. This makes the Temple itself wealthy and politically powerful, though their penchant for indiscriminate violence makes them dangerous allies.

#### *Aspects of Vimuhla*

Lord Vimuhla has 87 known Aspects; His idols usually depict a column of flame surrounded by black clouds brimming with red lightning. Warriors about to enter combat invoke Dumuggash, the Spirit of Battle, who appears as a naked man armed with sword and shield, His face and body contorted with battle-lust.  When a city is taken by Vimuhla’s followers, they give thanks by dressing a young soldier in the flayed skin of the enemy leader and dance in the image of Valegh, the Flayer. Artisans invoke the name of Menumeng, the Dark Flame, who represents heat without flame and is patron of those who use the sun to tan hides, dry fabric and melt ore.  Vimuhla’s most esoteric Aspect is Methqazh, the One Who is Seen Burning from Afar, portrayed as a geometric symbol and represents the light emanating from the sun, the planets and the moons.

The Lord of Flame is known by many names across Tekumel, He is worshipped by those who yearn for the catharsis of the flame.  Vimuhla is merely His Tsolyani name, to the Yan Koryani He is Vumél and the Mu’ugalavyani call Him Vemélish, though they consider Him an Aspect of the greater god, Hrsh\!  In the days of the Engsvanyali priest-kings, He was known as Vaomáhl.  The LivYani worship Ru'ungkáno, whose devotees burn small marks into their skin, much like other followers of Vimuhla.  He is Va’am to the savage N’luss and His visitation to the squalid warcamps of N’lussa brought forth the burning horde of the Dragon Warriors that swept down to plunder the rich, soft kingdoms of the south.

###### 

### 	***Wurú***

*The Unnamable, the Many-Legged Serpent of Doom, Cohort of Hru’u*

The eternal foe of Stability, Wuru serves His master by sowing chaos in every form.  The endless cycle of reincarnation, the weave of destinies, and the very concept of substance are abhorrent to Him.  Though devoted to the destruction of Stability itself, Wuru is a shrewd and cunning god, adept at pitting the forces of Stability against each other.  He protects and aids those He deems necessary to the goals of Change, even if they serve other gods.  Until the advent of the Ultimate Dark and the Coming of Universal Diversification, Wuru shall not rest.

The priesthood of Wuru wear variegated robes of black, mauve and darkest purple; these costumes are donned according to certain rituals believed to connect the wearer to the Chaos Beyond Chaos.  Much like their patron deity, they are considered trustworthy insofar as they are completely untrustworthy, honoring pacts only for so long as they remain advantageous, .  The inner ceremonies of the Temple of Wuru are performed in pitch darkness, His clergy navigating the ritual chambers by touch alone.  Though known for their mysterious doctrines, the clergy of Wuru can be quite cultured and have a marked fondness for pomp and pageantry, being avid patrons of the arts.  

The Many-Legged Serpent is known by many names across Tekumel, He is worshipped by all who explore the further regions of experience.  Wuru is merely His Tsolyani name, to the Yan Koryani He is Orwá and the Mu’ugalavyani call Him Urúish; in the days of the Engsvanyali priest-kings, He was known as Örú.  The Yan Koryani also believe He has an even more fearsome wife called Fyórg, who is responsible for all the ills unique to womanhood.  The Pe Choi consider Wuru to be closest in character to their deity called the Black Old One, but mirthfully gossip amongst each other how poorly humanity has interpreted Him.

## **The Shadow Gods**

The religious cultures of the Five Empires have each developed in unique ways since the fall of Engsvanyalu, but none more so than Livyanu.  The Shadow Gods are the most divergent pantheon in the known world, a testament to Livyanu’s long history of independence.  The Hierarchy of Tsamra deliberately misrepresent their gods’ attributes to foreigners, their outer rituals performed for the public are empty ceremonies meant to discourage further scrutiny, while the inner rituals are meant only for the eyes of the elite society, but even these may be obfuscations to mollify the intrigues of spies.  Regardless, the Livyani rarely divulge the tenets of their faith to outsiders, earning them a reputation for untrustworthiness, which many do not deserve.  

The following could be considered public knowledge of the Shadow Gods, the Livyani may be tight-lipped, but a few morsels of information have slipped out, perhaps by design.

**Qame'él.**  The Hierarchs of Tsamra claim Qame’el to be Chief of the Shadow Gods, depicting Him as a great, toad-like beast with fearsome horns and a long proboscis.  His temple is known as the House Rutilant and houses the original Tablets of Llyan, kept in sanctuary from thieves and overly curious eyes.

## **National Gods**

### ***Hrsh***

### ***Shiringgayi***

“Oh, may Shiringgáyi's black hole swallow them all.” **\-Salarvyani proverb**

The Viridian Goddess, Lady Shiringgayi is queen and mother goddess of Salarvyani.   Ancient Engsvanyali theologians determined Shirringgayi to be a hybrid goddess, a composite aspect between Avanthe and Dlamelish.  As a cult founded upon a revelation worthy of Pavar, Her viridian-robed clerics were welcomed into the ranks of the priest-kings. 

Salarvyani sneer at the outsider’s inability to see Her (Shiringgáyi) in Her Oneness.

Her color is viridian as the Salarvyani language does not discern between the blue or green  

### ***Mretten***

A goddess of the Southern Continent, primarily worshipped by the gentle Nyelsemi.

The merchant-princes of Haida Pakala worship Her as She Who Strides Upon the Wind and erect great obelisks in Her name.

### ***The Kolumel***

Among the myriad titles possessed by the God-Emperor of Tsolyanu is the “Envoy of Mankind unto the Courts of Heaven'' and "Speaker of the Will of the Gods Within the World”.  These are not mere flowery aggrandizements, for the Tsolyani truly worship their emperor as a living god.  This belief stems from the otherworldly properties of one of the three imperial treasures, the Seal of the Imperium, the word for which has since become synonymous with that of emperor (*Kolumel, f: Kolumelra*).  What purpose the seal originally held is unknown, but since the foundation of the imperium it has represented the emperor’s mandate of divine rule.  Miracles have been sometimes attributed to past God-Emperors and many ancient heroes have claimed to have been loaned power on their behalf, further cementing the divinity of the office and causing the Tsolyani to build small shrines in their homes to honor favored imperial personages. 

Like the priest-kings of old, the very word of the God-Emperor is treated as divine commandment, with but a simple proclamation and every legal apparatus in the nation will be bent to serve imperial will.  If it is decreed that fish fly and birds swim, dispatches will be sent to every corner of the empire and by the morrow fishmongers will be selling their “birds” to customers.  Thankfully, the reign of the 37th God-Emperor, Sunun Drantike “the Mad” was short, as the Omnipotent Azure Legion quickly realized the threat he posed to the imperium and hastened him upon his skein.

 

#### *The Choosing of Emperors*

A monarchy based solely on heredity will always fail, as the children of a great ruler are merely pale imitations of their sire, becoming weak, foolish and too reliant on easy living.  The sacred rites of *Kolumejalim* are a series of ceremonial trials, meant to test facets of character the Tsolyani deem needful for a ruler: bravery, endurance, cunning, physical prowess, judgment, knowledge of history and the arts, magic and a dozen other fields.  

After the sarcophagus of the deceased God-Emperor has been interred within the Portal of the Land Beyond Life beneath the necropolis of Bey Su.  Imperial scions are summoned to Bey Su to prepare for the ceremonies, hone their talents and gather champions to serve in up to three trials, as no one can master every skill.  Every heir is expected to compete, save for those who have “renounced the Gold” and thus their claim to the Petal Throne.  Political machinations may contrive to hinder the arrival of a scion or even reveal heirs raised in secret by high-ranking patrons, extensively trained in preparation of the day they are “given the Gold'' and can challenge their siblings for the Petal Throne.  Particularly brazen clans may attempt to pass off one of their own as a secret heir, this is a great risk as the Omnipotent Azure Legion rarely misplaces an imperial scion. 

After the conclusion of the *Kolumejalim* and the surviving candidates have been sacrificed, the enthroned princeling is dressed in the greatest of finery and is paraded through Avanthar to the gates of the Golden Tower.  The high priests of the Temples conduct the Last Rites of Being Human, formally investing the sovereign with godhood and the newly anointed God-Emperor is immediately immured within the Golden Tower.  Never again seen in public, speaking only through the First Prelate of the Court of Purple Robes, a circle of high-ranking courtiers and the de-facto priesthood of the imperial cult.  Rarely, private audiences are granted within the Cloisters of Divine Proximity, where a complex series of mirrors allows the God-Emperor to observe the supplicant, but obscures the imperial presence from lesser eyes.  Only one emperor on record has forgone the traditional rite of seclusion, the 41st God-Emperor, Hejjeka II “the Heretic” left Avanthar to personally lead his armies against the Salarvani.  The practice hasn't proven popular enough to continue, though blasphemous tales speak of the Omnipotent Azure Legion facilitating secret liaisons across the empire.

### ***Small Gods***

### ***Seven Deities of the Rising Peaks***

Quóth, the Many-Eyed: He Who Sees the World, Dweller upon the Rising Peak, Knower of the Mysteries, King of the Gods, Though None may Seek Him.  His House stands high upon the Peak.

Vihár, Lord of Swords and War, Lord of Fires and Iron.  His House stands in the Stony Heights.

Nyésset, the Hero.  Mighty One of Victories, Slayer of the Deadly Ssu, Conqueror of Cities, Companion of Viyar, Far-Wanderer.  His House is within the Forest, wherever He sets foot.

## **The Pariah Deities**

Whether it be the Ultimate Dark of Change or the Perfect Light of Stability, the designs of the gods both require the multiverse in some form or another.  Even Vimuhla, who desires only to engulf the whole of creation in flame, would weep if there were no more worlds to burn.  The unspeakable Pariah Deities subtly extend their influence across the planes, corrupting the denizens within and dragging entire worlds screaming into oblivion.  Their goal is nothing less than True Nullification, the complete extinction of possibility and substance forevermore.

The Pariah Deities are very old, worshipped as early as the Empire of Llyan of Tsamra, the veritable dawn of time for Tekumel.  Their cults thrived in every age prior to Pavar’s revelation; the Three States of the Triangle, the Dragon Warriors, the Fisherman Kings and the First Imperium.  It was the priest-kings of Engsvan hla Ganga who named them the Pariah Gods, fully aware of their abhorrent nature and attempted to force them to accede to the Concordat.  The Pariah cults spurned these tribunals and were put to the sword, their temples razed and scriptures burned.  Since then, the Pariah Deities have arisen time and time again to bedevil Tekumel; for their patience is measureless and new pawns can always be seduced with irresistible promises of wealth and power.  Isolated sects have even been discovered within the Temples, using existing factions and secret societies as cover for their nefarious plots

Outside of the Five Empires, in lands not touched by the ancient priest-kings, the Pariah Deities may hold sway without interference, much like they did in the days of antiquity.  Sages wary of their influence scrutinize the religious customs of distant lands, searching for evidence of the Pariah Gods or their Cohorts and Aspects, the names of which perished in the priest-kings purges.

### ***Goddess of the Pale Bone***

The most infamous of the Pariah Deities is none other than the Goddess of the Pale Bone, more commonly referred to as She Who Cannot Not Be Named.  The Goddess is easily the most voracious of the Pariah Deities, a cunning and merciless predator of worlds.  She dwells in the Outer Darkness, ceaselessly testing the Pylons of the Barrier Gods for weaknesses.  No Plane has ever gone quietly into Her ravening maw, even worlds that have slipped Her grasp never fully regain their glories.  

The ancient Bednalljans called Her Mshékh once, they feared Her terribly, but not enough to refuse Her gifts.  The ruins beneath Tsamra bear engravings made to Ku'ú-Tép, the name used by the inhabitants of the Empire of Llyan.

### ***The One Other***

Cold and calculating, The One Other interacts occasionally with the Lords of Stability and Change, tipping the scales in favor of one or the other.  He is most notable for His role in the *Lament to the Wheel of Black*, aiding the other gods in defeating the rebellious Ksarul and providing the means of imprisoning Him within the Blue Room.  His cults are exceedingly furtive and experts at concealing themselves from unwanted scrutiny, rumored to hide in plain sight.  Rumors abound that the priesthood of The One Other is involved in the Tsolyani *Kólumejálim*, the Choosing of the Emperor, as well as the funerary rites of the God-Emperors.

The One Other was named such by the ancient Bednalljans, who knew Him as Aíkh Amóm in their dead tongue; in the modern age He is called Nmédz by the inhabitants of Hlikku, the City of the Mad Ones.

*“The skies will crumple like a cloth crushed within a fist, the day will become night forever, and even the earth will cry out in anguish as it witnesses the toppling of the veritable thrones of the mighty Gods.”* **\-Warning at the gate of the Temple of Seven Sighs**

### ***The One Who Is***

There is a disturbing lack of information about The One Who Is.  Though the cults of the other Pariah Gods have proven difficult to eradicate over the long centuries, it would seem the initial purges of the priest-kings against the cults of The One Who Is have been suspiciously successful.  Second-hand scholarship of Bednalljan manuscripts reveal that The One Who Is was always distant and aloof, an almost mystical deity perfectly embodying nothingness, who does not exist, yet somehow does.  Certain intriguing legends describe the being having been imprisoned in the Darkness Below the World.  Fortunately, the gate to this lightless realm lies beneath the Temple of Seven Sighs, and can only be opened by special keys and rites performed at the fourteen shrines within, each built to honor the ten major gods of the *Mitlanyal* and four other unknown gods.

The One Who Is was named such by the ancient Bednalljans, who knew Him as Aíkh Halóm.   As much a cipher then as now, the name is a reminder and a warning, translating to “The One (Who) Exists” in their dead tongue.

# **Instruments and Ephemeris**

For peoples that once strode between stars, the Tekumelani have essentially been reduced to prehistoric barbarism.  But despite the limitations they suffer under by their forebears’ hubris, the Five Empires and their contemporaries thrive.  Their technologies approximate a melange of sophistication from the height of the Roman Empire to the Islamic Golden Age, with disparate remnants of an early Kardashev civilization scattered about.  

Tekumel was always an iron-poor world, though rich with other metals and precious stones.

### ***The Lamps of the Sky \- Astrology***

To the Tékumeláni, the shape of the world is a hotly debated subject, the Mu’ugalavani hold that the world is a flat plane, merely a leaf falling from the tree of time as it burns in eternity.  The Livyani claim that it is a perfect sphere and that it is possible to sail from eastern shores and arrive at the western shores sometime later.  All nations can agree that above Tekumel hangs the dome of the sky, a starless abyss of velvety darkness, lit only by the light of its sun, four planets and two moons.  Astrologer-navigators observe the passage of the planets and moons to chart journeys.  Amid these heavenly bodies, countless space installations & derelict starships from the Humanspace era drift in forgotten orbits.  What secrets could these vessels hold if adventurers could find a way to travel to them?  Or one could somehow reactivate one of the mysterious towers of imperishable metal to launch into the heavens?

#### *Tuléng*

Tékumel’s sun is the yellow-white star once known as Sinistra-Nu Ophiuchi, but now called Tuleng.  Priests of Hnalla, the Supreme Principle of Stability, hold their most important rituals when Tuleng is highest in the sky, believing it to their god’s eye. 

#### *Ülétl*

The first planet, Utetl is a dusty brown color and is associated with Sarku, the Lord of Worms.  It is symbolic of the powers of communication and the intellect, children born under its auspice are believed to be clever and well-spoken.  Unspeakable rites are held when Uletl is in the proper conjunction.  Uletl itself is uninhabitable with a toxic atmosphere. Brown dwarf?

#### *Riruchél*

The second planet, Riruchel is a deep scarlet color and associated with Karakan, Lord of War..  It symbolizes honorable war and societal strength, children born under its auspices are thought to be brave and selfless.  Warriors fight with greater valor when this planet is in proper conjunction, eager to catch the attention of their patron deity.  Riruchel itself is moderately inhabitable, but only at its poles.  It also has three moons, but these are invisible with the naked eye.

#### *Tékumel*

The third planet, Tékumel appears from afar as blue and green, with unsightly splotches of purple revealed upon close examination, it has two major continents, several microcontinents and countless small islands upon its lazy seas.  Tékumel’s day and year are approximate to that of Earth’s, altered by the intensive terraforming during the planet’s conquest.  The planet is half-again as large as Earth, but with a weaker magnetosphere due to its iron-poor core.

	The Mu’ugalavyani believe the world as a leaf falling through a burning tree.  Experiments measuring the shadows of posts 

##### 	Gayél

The eldritch green outer moon is associated with Dlamelish, the Lady of Pleasures.  The moon symbolizes her sensuality and it is believed that great artists and lovers are born under her auscipes.  The priesthood of Dlamelish holds regular orgies when this moon is full.  The lunar cycle of Gayel is approximately 30 days long.

##### 	Káshi

The bloody red inner moon is associated with Vimuhla, Lord of Flame.  It symbolizes his bloodlust and it is believed that great warriors are born under its auspices.  The priesthood of Vimuhla prepares towering bonfires into which they hurl sacrificial victims every full moon.  The lunar cycle of Kashi is approximately 15 days long.	

#### *Shíchel*

The fourth planet, Shichel is bright, sky-blue in color and associated with Avanthe, Lady of Heaven.  It symbolizes Avanthe’s gentleness and beauty, children born under its auspices are thought to be gentle souls.  Her priesthood conducts their fertility rites when Shichel is in proper conjunction during the spring and fall.  Shichel itself is a methane gas giant with five moons, but these are invisible with the naked eye.

#### *Zirúna*

The fifth and last planet, Ziruna is a dim, flickering purple in color and associated with Hru’u, the Supreme Principle of Change, it is sometimes referred to as “the sphere of sorcery”.  Ziruna itself is an airless ball of rock and ice with several moons, invisible to the naked eye; it is said to be inhabited by a race of beings that worship an Aspect of Gruganu known as Okh, the Warder of Devices. Brown dwarf/pulsar?

## 	**Weights and Measures**

Engsvanyali systems of measurements have been more widely used by middle class artisans, they seldom find use in lower class professions and it is considered unseemly for nobility to be knowledgeable in such matters, as it is beneath their station.  Rather infuriatingly, aristocrats will purposefully exaggerate the duration of a feast or minimize how far away the next city is in order to display how meaningless such concerns are to them.

## 	**Arms and Armour**

Common weapons, armor for adventurers.  As well as metal substitutes.	

Nudity is highly commonplace on Tekumel, where the climate is pleasant enough to forego clothing.  There are few places where it gets cool enough to warrant protection from the elements, thus the primary purpose of clothing is as a signal of social station, profession and wealth.  One’s body is considered a thing of beauty and both sexes utilize whatever means to accentuate that beauty; jewelry, cosmetics, hairstyles, fragrances and of course, fashion.  Every culture possesses traditional costumes, with regional and contemporary differences, serving as a good means of identifying fellow emigrants when abroad.

The lower classes make do almost entirely with practical clothing; wide-brimmed hats or ponchos for protection from the sun or heavy aprons and gloves for blacksmiths.  Other classes adopt the fashions particular to their social group; *kheshchal*\-plumed headdresses of the aristocracy, flat squarish caps of the merchants, or the gilded ceremonial armor of a temple-guard.  

Armor is almost never made of metal, as iron is both in short supply and of poor quality.  The grades best suited for weapons are prohibitively expensive, available only to those of means.  Bronze armor is both cheaper and commonplace, but often.  The Temple of Sarku dresses its temple-guard in

**Dsách-nn-tk.** A Pe Choi liqueur, weak by human standards, but palatable.

**Zu’ur (100gp).**  A particularly dangerous and addictive aphrodisiac, produced by the insectile H’luss on their island in the southern sea.  Capable of inducing miraculous feats of erotic performance for over a month, afterwhich the victim collapses into a comatose state, rousing only for further doses of the drug.  Zu’ur is especially resistant to attempts to purify the body by magic, but the Temple of Thumis claims it is nearing a breakthrough.  As for now, death is the only known release from its addictive qualities, even the smallest taste carries the promise of ruination within half a year's time.  The possession of Zu’ur is a capital offence in the Five Empires,

Map symbols (*Chanmisenikh*) are opaque geometric gemstones etched with small, intricate patterns that convey geographical information. Every contour, whorl and texture reveals  mountain ranges, rivers and cities to those who know how to read the designs with their fingers.  Proficiency in High Cartography allows you to read map symbols, seeing how to navigate the course of a specific journey.  Map symbols began as an attempt to recreate ancient devices of magitechnolgical origin, which conveyed information by touching the filigreed circuitry.  Such devices are a rarity nowadays, but occasionally one finds a seemingly ordinary map symbol that whispers in unknown tongues or sends imagery directly into the mind's eye when touched.

## 	**Hirelings**

Servants and slaves.

Like most pre-modern societies, slavery is a common practice in the Five Empires and beyond.  Even the Ever-Glorious Empire of Engsvan hla Ganga, with its mighty sorceries and magitechnological wonders, still employed legions of slaves to build their palaces. 

Slavery is almost always a matter of misfortune; war captives taken by a victorious army, hopeless debtors selling their children or derelicts rounded up by slave-catchers.

## 	**Kichenggukh \- Illness**

*"The hand of Srukarum touches whom he wills.”* **\-Tsolyani proverb**

Despite losing millenia of biological knowledge from dozens of sophonts, Tekumelani medicine is still a thriving field.  Many diseases of Old Earth had been eradicated and forgotten, but new ailments from countless planets have come to take their place.  Worse still, the exquisitely-tailored bioweapons of the Great Ancients have spilled unto the world, rendering entire regions uninhabitable for generations.  Sorcery has proven a boon to the healing arts, the magicians of the Latter Times wrought spells capable of eliminating viruses, bacteria and other pathogens from the body. Though diseases have since developed resistances, spells that used to cure certain maladies outright now only provide temporary succor.

Within the Five Empires, the Livyani are considered the finest physicians, , The pharmacopeias fill over twenty bulky volumes of remedies, their forebears having meticulously tested the healing properties of the myriad herbs and plants of the known world.  In addition, Tsolyani surgeons have approximated germ theory, viewing diseases less as demonic influence and more akin to “invisible animals”; after finding that clean tools and workspaces lead to better outcomes when amputating limbs or performing trepanations on patients.  Perhaps in time, the Tekumelani may be able to modify their sorcery appropriately to better combat these new strains.  

**The Mottled Plague.**  Contracted by ancient humanity upon contacting the Pachi Lei, who are naturally immune. The Mottled Plague ravaged Tsolyanu and Mu’ugalava in 1046 A.S., a similar disease called the Spotted Plague appeared in 2195 A.S., both prefer hot and humid climates, and are spread by touch or by inhalation of the breath of a victim. The buds of the *Tsural* plant seem to improve survival chances, provided a poultice is applied early and often during the length of the infection.

**Plague of the White Hand.** This malady is less deadly, but is one of the more widespread diseases of Tekumel.  How it is communicated is unknown, as it appears suddenly to infect several victims within a radius of only a few *Tsan*, only to disappear and begin to infect others in a completely different region.  Notably, it is the cause of the demise for the 6th God-Emperor of Tsolyanu, during its most widespread infection.  There is no known cure, though recovery though natural immunity can play a factor, the disease progresses quickly, the first symptoms being the whitening of the fingertips and nails, soon after comes the loss of sensation in extremities, then paralysis and death within 2-3 days.

**Rotting Death.** This disease was first encountered by humanity when engaging with Shen spacefarers, originally being an ailment that affected their animals.  It spreads through contaminated water and afflicts young men and women.  There is a milder variant called Black Flux which induces horrible vomiting and painful diarrhea, most of the lives it claims are children or the aged.  The treatment of which is a drink made from the bitter bark of the *Hmiss*\-weed, imported from Shenyu, but dried and powdered samples can be found across the Five Empires.  Most physicians recommend a meatless diet and plentiful sunlight to 

**Ailment of Arkhuan Mssa.** A particularly horrific disease named after an Engsvanyali priest-king who perished from it. The victim’s skin erupts with grotesque buboes and morbid lesions, only a handful of victims survive the ailment.  There is no course of treatment other than attempting to preserve the dignity of the patient.

**The Great Plague.** This disease ravaged the Chakas in 2,342 A.S., but only the Pe Choi were affected, causing their twin sets of lungs to slowly fill with fluid, victims effectively drowning on dry land.  Thankfully it hasn’t been seen since, but the hydrophobic Pe Choi have not forgotten the horror of those days.

**Scale Itch.** Greatly feared by every Shen, Scale Itch causes the victim’s scales to prematurely shed, the condition is arduous, causing great lethargy and eventually death.  The best course of action is to simply make the victims comfortable, providing regular rubbings of the Blazing Ivy plant, a traditional Shen remedy for the ailing.

**Forest Fungus.** To the communal Pachi Lei, exile is a fate worse than death.  Contracting Forest Fungus is dangerous not only to the victim, but their entire home tree.  Whole families have been lost, entire communities devastated by allowing an infected to dwell among them.  Though the pain of loss is great, there is solace knowing the commune lives because of their sacrifice.  There is no cure, the Forest Fungus claims any healer that dares challenge it.  

The False Plague.

**Brain Fever.**  Causes Hlaka to gradually lose coordination until they can do little more than flop about and foam at the mouth until they die of dehydration.  There is no known cure, ailments of the brain are difficult enough to treat, and the Hlaka are not known for the sophistication of their healing methods. 

**City Sickness.**  Delving into the ruins left behind by the Great Ancients is certainly not without risk, but there are threats within that cannot be fought with a blade or quick wits.  The tribes of the Tane named it for the ruined city of Ayo, those who dwell too long among those crumbling towers become nauseous and find their skin turning red in places, as if burned by a flame.  If one is foolish enough to return, the burns worsen and in a mere few days, your hair begins to fall out in ragged clumps.  Without the aid of powerful healing magics, death by ravenous cancers is assured.

Nininyal bubonic plague

Ahoggya limb paralysis

**Miasm of Needles.** Tinalya are immune So named for the unpleasant sensation it produces, this disease is Tinalya

**Fur Rot.** An affliction endemic to the South Pole, traveling with Urunen 

**White Mold.**  One of Tekumel’s surviving native diseases, infecting only Ssu and H’luss communities.  It seems to spread suddenly, as derelict H’luss hive-ships have been found with the entire crew dead, their exoskeletons bursting with fruiting buds of white fungus.

### ***Vitru-Mihalli***

Unbeknownst to most, there are two kinds of Shape-Changers, those encountered by most are *Drengh-Mihalli* (“Young Mihalli”), but when they grow old enough they become *Vitru-Mihalli* (“Elder Mihalii”).  Just how the nigh-immortal Mihalli judge age is unknown, but it must involve the counting of the eons.  In their eternal wanderings, the Shape-Changers adopt many forms and identities, spending entire lifetimes in various alien morphologies blurs the borders of the individual.  Every one of the Vitru-Mihalli is a nation unto itself, a collective of false lives surrounding the merest speck of its original personality at the core.  

Most Vitru-Mihalli are lost across time and space, dwelling in safe, familiar forms, unaware of their true nature.  When they are threatened or injured, revealing themselves as a shapeless mass of protoplasm streaked with impossible colors.   Greater Mihalli society seems to allow this state of affairs, though they gleefully welcome Vitru-Mihalli that retain enough of their faculties to return to the Unstraightened City.  These Vitru-Mihalli are considered something of a bodhisattva within Mihalli society.

### ***Sro***

The Sro are commonly found in the far northwest, in the mountains of N’lussa, the highlands of Mu’ugalavya and the Plain of Towers.  The Sro are also found in the jungles of Tane, where some Tane tribes have somehow tamed the beasts and ride upon them in short, armored towers.  They bear a marked similarity to the Serudla and Gachaya, each being a dangerous, multi-limbed reptile, but growing vastly larger than their cousins.  The Sro walks upon six taloned legs, can fly with a pair of brightly-colored wings and lastly possess a small pair of forelimbs that act as hands.  The Sro are possibly the largest land animal on Tekumel and are equally dangerous in the air and sea.  The common Sro are 15-20 feet in length, but these are young ones and as they grow older they will also grow in size.  Larger specimens are a rarity, the Sro are generally solitary and territorial, two or more Sro in a given region will fight each other for dominance.

Dragon-Kings

Though incapable of speech, they are possessed of a wicked alien intelligence, showing an understanding of whatever languages that are spoken near where they make their lairs.  Sro can also be bargained with, there are accounts of villages offering treasures to the creatures either for protection or to dissuade attack. The Sro make frequent use of tools and weapons, Mu’ugalavyani mosaics commonly depict the great reptiles wielding a greatsword in both in their foremost claws.  They don’t appear to fashion anything themselves, so how they acquire such items can only be assumed, possibly purchased from the inimical species.

#### 	*War-Sro*

Raised from hatchlings by the fief-lords of Tane, the War-Sro is a stockier, heavier breed of creature, incapable of flight due to their size, but the Tane regularly clip their wings, as a precaution.  The Tane mount howdahs upon the War-Sro’s back, kept in place with an ingenious system of sturdy belts.

##### *The Jakallan Underworld*

*As befits its title as “the City Half as Old as the World”, Jakalla has had a long and storied life.  Throughout the millennia, the city has seen the rise and fall of empires, and likewise suffered countless disasters, sieges and uprisings during the same span of time.  But Jakalla still stands proud, rebuilt and remade over and over again, to the point where most of the city is simply built atop itself.  Below the hustle and bustle of the surface lies the city’s Underworld, a network of  chambers and tunnels dug out of Jakalla’s buried ruins.*

*The Underworld is commonly accessed by the city’s sewage system, though smugglers have been known to have dug secret tunnels from the City of the Dead outside Jakalla’s walls.  The shallower levels bear similar architecture as the surface, having been buried relatively recently, the Temples of the Gods each have built subterranean shrines around this depth.  Most of these resemble typical sanctuaries, much like what is found above; the Temple of Thumis, for example, keeps a library of rare and highly prized manuscripts below ground.  The largest of Jakalla’s Underworld shrines belongs to the Temple of Hru’u; a sprawling complex of ornate halls, refectories, apartments, dungeons, and ceremonial chambers for conducting the sect’s secretive inner rituals.*

*The further one descends down, stranger and more dangerous secrets may be discovered.  The deeper layers of the Jakalla’s Underworld do not always lie directly under the shallower ones, the city’s footprint  has migrated subtly over the centuries, what was once the grounds of an Engsvanyali priest-king’s palace may now be occupied by a cluster of tenement buildings, the residents unaware of the riches beneath their feet.  The Garden of Weeping Snows is one such Engsvanyali-era ruin forgotten under the weight of time; once home of Nyelmu the Necromancer.  The wizard is said to dwell there still, imprisoned within the Palace of Frost at the centre of the garden, surrounded by luxury and indulging in every decadence imaginable, but unable to take any joy from it.  Cursed by the Lords of Stability for prying too deeply into Tekumel’s distant past, unable to die and unable to leave the garden of poisonous, snow-colored vegetation and cold, milky-white marble.  Nyelmu welcomes all who find the garden, especially those of delightful character, who may find themselves permanent guests.  Those that insult or bore the wizard will be tortured and frozen at the height of their agonies by means of a device called the Excellent Ruby Eye.   These poor souls are then taken to be added to Nyelmu’s Tableaux of Torments.*
