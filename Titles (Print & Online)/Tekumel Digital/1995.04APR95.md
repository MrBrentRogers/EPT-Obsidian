I must say that I am the VERY proud owner of two personally autographed
copies of the novels.  I managed to get both done at different Minicon
appearances.  One of those times I was able to briefly play in a game with
Prof. Barker.  I have got to rate all of those as my most enjoyable
moments with Tekumel.  I might even have a spare copy of Man of Gold, and
I know where I can get moreif folks would like a copy.

Hi

What about publishing via this "new and wonderful" informationsuperhighway? :)

I can't think of how it would work, but there are a lot of bright people
out there reading this, and I'm sure that they could offer an opinion.

Perhaps, the shareware concept would work. Read the first one (or two), and get
the third by registering - by sending $6 (or whatever) to Professor B.

Fairly obviously, chapters could be posted to various newsgroups, to 
stimulate interest...

I, for one, would buy a copy of the novel(s) in text form. Anyone else?

Anyone got any opinions? 

I read quite recently that a chap *has* published a book on the net, and
also in paper form simultaneously...

TTFN

Can anybody tell me what software to use to upload graphics, pictures,
etc.? If I want to send a Tekumel picture (font, application) to someone,
how do I go about it? Please answer in terms we Paleolithic types can
understand! I shall be much gratified! I know about uuUndo to DOWNLOAD
binaries and graphics, but how to SEND stuff is still a mystery.

Bob, I hope you'll wait a bit and test the new Tekumel rules put out by
Tome. Then you may not need all these rules conversions to other peoples'
systems -- conversions that work but which (for me) do not express some of
Tekumel's specifics very well. I keep seeings "GURPS-Tekumel," "A-D-&-D
Tekumel," "Runequest-Tekumel" -- why not "Monopoly-Tekumel?" -- but not
"Tekumel-Tekumel." This has been largely my fault: too much to do and no
longer the energy, health, or willpower to write yet ANOTHER set of rules
(when I am basically BORED by rules and continue to game Tekumel with
almost no rules at all). But soon we shall have a new set, and I hope
people will give them a try before running off to more familiar territory.

	Sounds like a good idea, but Professor Barker should consider 
doing this in a serial format.  That is, you'd get the first couple of 
chapters free, then have to pay a fee for the rest.  I don't know how 
this could be done completely online, but perhaps someone better versed 
at the intricacies of cyberspace would know?
	Professor Barker could also take his time writing the book, as he 
would be able to put out the novel one chapter at a time out here, then 
work on the next for a space of time.  Not unlike the way writers like 
Dickens and Conan Doyle did things, see what I mean?

	Religion may not be inherent to some FRP games, but it is 
essential to Tekumel, because the "gods" really exist, at least within 
the game.  True, they are not really gods, but they are so powerful that 
the sentient beings on that world (at least, in the known world) regard 
these almost-omnipotents AS gods.
	Various source books of Professor Barker's try to point this out 
about Tekumel's culture, that even though they are operating under a 
delusion, it's probably a healthy one.  For example, if enough people on 
that world told the "gods" to kiss off, these same "gods" would most 
likely destroy that section of the planet.  This would certainly instill 
respect in the survivors, and is most probably what happened to Engsvan 
hla Ganga.
	After a period of time, most folks would probably only give 
lip-service to these "gods", but the people who really matter -- the 
priests and politicians -- would still have strong faith in them, due to 
their actual contact with their "gods".  They probably have also given 
and received favors from each other, enforcing their relationship.  And 
since they're in charge, the masses who don't care at least have to 
pretend they do.
	In a world like this, you could roleplay a character who doesn't 
really believe in "gods", but just goes through the motions of 
obeisance.  But don't expect the character to stay cynically aloof for 
too long, because sooner or later, (s)he would directly experience the 
presence of a "god" or "goddess".  The character could still pretend that 
(s)he didn't have a numinous experience, but we all know the character 
would be lying to themselves.
	Staying an atheist in a Tekumel campaign means the GM is 
deliberately witholding any meetings between the characters and the 
"gods".  This is definitely NOT in the spirit of the game.  An adventurer 
should have had at least one encounter with a "god" or "goddess" while 
wandering the expanses of both known and unknown Tekumel.  More likely, 
three or four.
	These can create some of the most interesting roleplaying in the 
game, in exact opposition to the other FRPG, which seems to devalue their 
gods to the point where they're wimps for any high-level party to take 
out.  Not so in Tekumel.  These "gods" don't even THINK like the 
characters do!  The most powerful person on Tekumel is a flea compared to 
their power and knowledge.
	A Tekumeli might be able to trick a "god" on occasion, due to their 
different ways of thinking, but don't even try to best them at their own 
games.  Such foolishness tends to make for short life-spans.  Or 
extremely long, torturous ones.  These "gods" do like their sport.

     I have a question regarding skills in the White Book for Character
Generation book Sec 9.3 hobby skills.  Weapon Skills are listed there can
a character take these at the reduced cost and apply toward the warrior
skills
that are listed on the character sheet.  This also true for the soldering
skills and other professional and academic skills that could be bought at
lower costs in the hobby skills section.

I had intended this to be so -- but at a reduced rate. On p. 41 I wrote,
"... you may convert relevant hobby skills into spells or warrior weapons
at a rate of 3 hobby skills = 1 spell or 1 weapon level." This was clear
enough to me, and I meant it to apply to all hobby skills (soldier, etc.).
Neil Cauley (my co-author) says that there is an ambiguity here, and we
will probably fix it in a rules error-list. At the moment I can't see what
it is. Buy 3 hobby levels of some warrior weapon, and count it as 1 level
of actual fighting skill. Etc.

Secs. C.1 and C.2 in Book Two involve promotions within the temple
hierarchy, not the acquisition of spells. You go up in rank but not in
knowledge (sounds like some professors I used to know ...!). You need to
rise in rank because only in this way will you meet people of power, get
access to libraries and ancient artefacts, and make your way in the
political world that passes for the priesthoods on Tekumel. Actual spells
for "adventuring" are available from Sec. C.6, using the same educational
process you used in Book One, Sec. 8.5.

All of this needs cleaning up somewhat -- and will be eventually. Sorry!

While the point about atheism, etc...is well taken, I still would have to 
say that it is possible for a person in Tekumel to have direct contact 
with "deity" or its manifestations, while still remaining relatively 
secular in attitude.

The best example of this is given in Professor Barker's book flamesong. 
Trinesh (If that was the main character's name, its been a while) begins 
the work as a rather secular moderate of Lord Vimuhla. He encounters 
Flamesong, a divine artifact, in the story. Yet, at the end, he is able 
to appreciate the Mihalli, Aluja's statement that the Gods are merely 
very powerful being who can effectively muck up the world. The best thing 
for humans to do is avoid involving them in their affairs, and kick them 
out once they have become as powerful as the Gods are. Trinesh and his 
second in command appreciate this view, though they don't start spreading 
it around. 

They do not become instant devout believers due to their experience.

As far as the theological system of Tekumel goes, and has been stated 
earlier, these Gods did not create anything (life, the world, etc). This 
leaves the basis for worship to be a combination of fear and greed. Fear 
in that they are the biggest, baddest mamma jamma's around, so if they 
want worship, that's what they get. Greed because they offer power, via 
spell and knowledge to their worshipers. This is not a basis that would 
inspire the higher ups, or any intellectual elite to follow them out of 
devotion, more out of will to power.

Also remember that humanity (as well as Shenity, Pe Choity, etc...) were 
once far more powerful than they are now. The creations of the ancients 
are a reminder of this fact, and would tend to reinforce the idea that 
man (etc...) could potentially become greater than it is now, or regain 
what it has lost.

Finally, there is the existance of beings who do not appear to be in the 
thrall of the deities as much as the "normal" species of Tekumel. The 
Mihalli are one of the best examples. This would also tend to drive home 
the idea that it is possible to not worship, yet still be free to live as 
one would. Maybe no for humanity now, but perhaps someday.

All of these factors would indicate to me that true devotion, or 
fanaticism (such as that of Trinesh's Vriddi Chaplain) would be 
relatively less common than moderate to secular views, though actual 
public athiesm would be near non-existant.

Well, I have already pre-ordered by Gardasiyal set, and I will certainly 
give it a once over and perhaps a run or two.  But lets face it, the real
attraction of Tekumel is the setting, not the game mechanics.  As you have
(from what I hear) already discovered, mechanics-heavy systems are just not
as effective as a lightweight, streamlined, little-or-no-rules kinda setup.

Right now, I am setting up my game using the mechanics from Over The Edge
(side note: right now I am calling this jezu mikqapa -- does this strike
you as a reasonable translation?) because of its heavy emphasis on 
character and setting.  I am mainly looking for Gardasiyal's magic system
info, since I have EPT but not S&G vol2.

OTOH, I hope Gardasiyal sells like all getout.  Need to get the pipeline
moving, and a new system always helps.

Best,
John Reece

There are several unzippers available under Unix.  Plus, if you use .Z
compressed files you'll also have to use tar or some other archiver to
stick them into a single archive file---messy.

Recommendation: Use ZIP.

Yes, the first book of the new rules set has the differences in stats for
nonhuman characters. The third book also has some stuff for nonhuman
NPCSs. You'll find it helpful, I hope! You still can't roll up a
player-character Serudla or Sro (or Ssu, Hluss, or other inimical
species), but you can do most of the friendly intelligent species. In our
gaming groups we rarely try to play nonhumans -- the mind-sets are too
different, and we don't want to be just "Americans in alien costumes." But
I have seen very good Pe Choi characters, a few passable Shen, and a
couple of Tinaliya that were so exasperating that they deserved worse than
they got!

In our world, religions are usually used to wield power, i.e. the priest 
classes threaten retribution and the followers kow-tow. If a natural 
disaster happens then the priests use this as "proof" of the power of 
their god(s). After 5,000 years or so, the followers get wise to these 
tricks. They call the priests' bluff, overthrow them and set up a 
rational, secular society. (Finally happened in about 1860 in our world 
when Origin of the Species was published)

On Tekumel, things must be slightly different. Priests still wield power, 
but the threat of divine retribution is real! Every 5,000 years or so the 
followers *think* that they've gotten wise, call the priests' bluff and 
get obliterated. They never get to set up a rational, secular society, 
and one of the major causes of technological, moral and social change is 
eliminated.

It's no wonder that cultures on Tekumel stagnate for millenia (... in 
technological, moral and social terms; they may be very dynamic societies 
in artistic, cultural and other matters).

i'm not sure how it's done, or if the various commercial
font-developement programs support it, but there are such things as
2-byte fonts for the Mac, and Windows 95 will support Unicode, which
does the same thing.  in both cases, you get 256x256 characters by
requiring two keystrokes, which combine to pick the character.  it's
much like you mentioned, except that it's a part of the operating
system, and so should work in any application.  therefore, all you'd
need is the font and your favorite word processor.  again, i'm not sure
how to create a font that utilizes this.  also, for the mac you'd need
the Japanese language kit, i think, and either something similar for
the PC, or wait for windows 95.

however, i just remembered that there is one other solution, at least
on a mac.  i'm not sure, but i suspect that it can also be done somehow
on a PC.  in a mac font, you can designate a character as appearing
over the next character that is typed.  thus, there is a circumflex
character, for example, and you type it, followed by a vowel, say "a",
and you get "a circumflex".  this is the standard way it deals with
european diacreticals.  This doesn't address the right-to-left problem,
but it might help with squeezing enough characters into a 256-character
font.

hope some of the above helps.

Debates over imaginary religions can get so fascinating.  Piermaria may
have made a mistake in assuming that a religion has to make sense--in fact,
if religion simply explained the laws of the universe and how it was created,
it would be more like science--a rule book of creation, if you will.
I think religion is more satisfying to practitioners if there is a sense
of awe and mystery to it, a feeling that some things must be left to the
individual to discover.  More importantly, I don't think humans should be
able to comprehend all of the facets of creation, even if there is a single,
logical, coherent system that religion explains.  If humans could comprehend
this, what would separate them from their gods?  Gods would not be nearly
so worship-worthy if they were no smarter or omniscient than humans, merely
more powerful.  Of course, Tekumel is unique among RPG universes, to my
knowledge, where the gods are real, but they are not true deities in the
way that we currently understand the word.

Thanks for the reply, hopefully I can get my hobby shop to order me a set and 
a couple for the shop so I can get others hooked on the game.

Greetings. I have on occassion seen a list of the various Tekumel 
products distributed throughout the history of the game. I haven't seen 
an annotated list, one that describes the content of the various 
products. Has one been made? Of special value to me would be an annotated 
list that also compared the products to each other.

Also, when is the TOME product being released, and where does it fit in 
comparison to the lineage of earlier products? (Is it a complete set of 
rules and background, or rules only, etc etc.)

Thank you, and I would love replies via email in addition to posted 
replies; I do not visit newsgroups very often. 

Thanks!

I ran a D&D game, using their relatively wimpy 'gods' that could be taken 
out by a party of powerful PCs, but presented my players with an 'atheistic 
religion' that denied the divinity of these beings, seeing them as no 
more than very very powerful bullies.  The central teaching of this 
religion was that all beings ought to respect the rights of lesser ones, 
and not exploit them.  Of course, this message was perverted by the royal 
government into a mandate to go out and 'liberate' any neighbors that 
happened to be theists...

Actually I'd be very interested in this as well. Go certainly can be
used as a bit of a substitute, but DenDen, now that would be such a
wonderful prop and tool to get players into the game.

For those of you who live around the Denver Metro area, or will be in the
area the Weekend of June 23-25 1995, I am pleased to annouce that I will 
be running two Tekumel events at Ben-Con '95. On Friday evening I will be
running a role-playing event and Saturday night I will be running a 
Qadardalikoi miniature battle.

Ben-Con is sponsored by the Rocky Mountain Benefit Gamers Association, and 
dedicated to raising money for charity (hence the name BENefit CONvention).
For registration or additional information you can e-mail either myself
or whitet@csn.org. For your information, I am a board member of the RMBGA
and would love to see this convention really take off. In addition to my two
Tekumel events, we will have the standard role-playing, board gaming, magic,
a Puffing Billy tournement, etc. Our special guest of honor will be 
Margret Weis.

Now back to our regulary scheduled Tekumel discussions.

Hi,

According to the flyer I managed to pry out of TOME, the "special offer"
on Gardasiyal (the new Tekumel/EPT RPG) ran out at the end of March. I
assume that that meant it would be released April 1 (bad date, that?).
*Has* it been released yet? If not, *when* (if ever) is it likely to be
released? Does Prof. Barker have any idea?

Or is it going to be like Vol #3 of "Swords and Glory" ... vapourware?

Any info will be greatly appreciated.

You can ask TOME to provide information. Essentially, there is the
Bestiary (critters and societally challenged alien minority groups), 3
vols. of solitaire adventures (which provide lots of background), possibly
a few (very few!) copies of the first 2 vols. of the old Tekumel
Sourcebook, and coming soon -- late April -- the new rules. These are
completely new rules, though based roughly on Sword and Glory. They
include the usual: movement, combat, rolling up npcs, rolling up alien
characters, combat, magic, lots of new magic items, books, etc., and some
stuff for referees. New map, new art, etc. The map should be out this week
and is the last item to be included in the fancy box. For background, you
and others may want to bug TOME to reprint the earlier Sourcebook in its
entirety.

Actually, I have already ordered TWO copies of Gardasiyal, and I have
hungrily devoured every Tekumel-Tekumel rules set published!  My AD&D rules
were originally designed to try to bring EPT more up to date, and I have
made the effort to post them primarily for those folks who have players
who would like to try Tekumel, but don't want to invest in the new rules.
I have advised in my conversion, and I do so again here, that AD&D Tekumel
is NOT a stand-alone product, and that it is highly recommended that
referees have access to the Tekumel rules sets.  I am also going to run
a demo adventure using the new rules at a local games store as soon as
possible.  So don't worry--I will be giving the new rules a very thorough
check-through, and I intend to encourage as many people as I can to give
them a try as well.

Dear Bob,

I would appreciate a copy of those rules when you finish debugging the
file transfer system. I have been a long time fan of Tekumel and wish to
bring others into the fold. I have also preordered the TOME product and
hope it lives to its quite high price tag. ($45.00/36.00 sheesh!)

This isn't really a question or such but I've only just discovered this list
and wanted to say that I've been a fan of Tekumel since the original EPT rules
came out.

Unfortunately it's never been big in the gaming circles I've moved in and has
mainly been read for enjoyment. In addition do you know how hard it's been
until recently to find some of the material in Australia?

Fortunately the TOME products are avaialable now so things have improved.

I think nearly all users of this newsgroup would agree that effectively
disseminating Tekumel at the same time that Professor Barker gets handsful
of money would be a good thing.  I think they'd also agree that this is
not quite happening.  I do not see Tekumel in many stores in the Bay Area.
Barker's world is a superior product: the vision usually reserved for
a literary figure, combined with the intellectual rigor of a social
scientist.  So why hasn't it been more successful in the market?

First of, before people think I'm sounding too critical, let me say
that I appreciate everyone's efforts to bring Tekumel to the market.
I have spoken with my dollars, I own nearly everything produced by or
on behalf of Barker, and I am delighted with what I have.  I feel
fortunate to have had access to his volumnia.

But it seems to me that an essentially iconoclastic rules systems is
counter-productive media to market Tekumel, whose best appeal is 
its total vision.  Roleplaying has evolved to the point where the
best rules DON'T get in the way.  While Barker often exhorts the
utility of on-the-fly refereeing, his published rules sets to date
are too cumbersome to be appealing to the current generation of
roleplayers, and this serves to impede market adaption.

Instead, it is the WORLD of Tekumel that must be sold, the images
of an alien but enduring civilization, more detailed and realistic
than Tolkein was in toto.  Tekumel's selling strength is its richness
of detail, the thoroughness of Barker's work.  Whereas as Tolkein
was a linguist, Barker is a more rounded social scientist.  Middle
Earth is a sterile place, there is no religion, but Tekumel fairly
stinks of its people.  Social interaction is the foundation of role
playing: people in a room discussing what other people would or are
doing in another situation.  Barker brings a much more convincing
description of what people do under various conditions than nearly
any other role playing world I have seen.  Tekumel might not be
possible physically, but it seems plausible socially.  In a game
that centers around character interaction, this is an important
plus (it's kind of hard to relate, in any deep way, with a Palladin
on a Quest for a +5 Holy Avenger).

I bought and will continue to buy Tekumel because I no longer have
the time to invent so widely, but I want to roleplay in a vivid,
detailed world that is not historical.  Barker's is the most complete
and well developed world on the market.

I would submit that the best media for Tekumel would be as reference
materials, as free from formal rules as possible.  This would lead
with Tekumel's main strength, and not being tied to any particular
rules, would enjoy a broader market.  This would allow more referees
to adopt it, which leads to more players, which leads to a larger
market.  I am afraid that by coming out with the solo adventures
first, TOME may have actually sabotaged the market for the rules set.
Sell someone a game they can't play, and they won't come back.
After nearly half a dozen such catastrophes, only us hardcore
fanatics remain.

If I were in charge of marketing Tekumel, here is what I'd do.
First, I'd suck up everything Barker ever authorized printing,
and suck it up into an optical scanner.  I'd cross-reference
the hell out of it, and hire an Anthropology or Sociology 
grad student (a good one, one that teach) to summarize the
general structure of it.  At the same time, I'd start showing
some of the stuff to artists, and sell them on.  Not necessarily
hire them, mind you, but impress upon them the vision of this alien
world.  There are a lot of poor but talented artists out there,
especially young ones, and I'd eventually hit the jackpot.

Paper is still superior to CD ROM, both in terms of utility and
market penetration, so I'd publish an Encyclopedia Tekumel
(something they would never do themselves).  I could get sales
at $29.95, especially if it was richly illustrated and complete
in the essential details.  People pay more than that regular
for some god-awful crap, and would be delighted to have something
of real value for that.  I would format it much more like an
encyclopedia, with maps, diagrams, tables, even the summary of
linguistics.  Think of how much money TSR makes selling endless
false maps of those ridiculous charicatures of worlds (Forgotten
Realms and Greyhawk).

In order to recover more money earlier, I would sell limited edition
numbered leathbound drafts at a higher price to people like myself.
They would have more mistakes than the final, but fanatics would love
to have the material.  The fanatics (and I count myself among them)
would use the material to prepare the larger market by incorporating
it into games and showing it off to their friends.  If Tekumel ever
did prove to be substantially more popular, these early editions would
also become collector's items, adding to the mystique.

Given the current state of affairs, this is what I would do
immediately.  I haven't seen the new map yet, but I can tell you
I still remember pulling the first map out of original EPT boxed
set: that thing was gorgeous!  TOME may have some trouble convincing
stores to stock their $45.00 RPG sets, but the map and a brief color
booklet would sell like hotcakes at under $20, and would sell, but
not nearly as well, as a thicker book and map for $25.  As a $14.95
color poster map of Tekumel framed by text and images, well, I could
sell those hand over fist.

Then later I could sell those Encyclopedias, maybe more than one
volume, at $29.95, easy.

I understand that TOME can't really do this directly now: they need
as much of that $45 as they can get to recover their costs.  But the
market is very small, and not as many of them are going to sell as
TOME would like.

Pictures, images, words, a vision: that's what sells about Tekumel,
not rules.

Again, I am not saying that I believe the product to be inferior,
or that I did not receive fair value for my money, I'm just saying
that the market for the current products is too narrow, and the
market for other products could be much broader.

As some of you know, John Medway and I are developing a new set of miniatures
rules for Tekumel. For most troop types, the ratings are fairly obvious. But
the Ghatoni have become problematic. 

Ghatoni troops are described as ferocious but undisciplined fighters. At first
this would seem to call for them to be rated as irregular (which in our rules
means they are prone to charging off toward the enemy and more difficult to 
manuever). But illustrations show them in uniform dress, a sign of more 
regular troops. So what is the answer, regular (well trained, controlled,
easy to manuever) or irregular? If the latter, should they really be
uniformly equipped, or was this artistic license? 

Continuing on this line of inquiry, the YK army book lists the Ghatoni as 
swordsmen, but the illustrations show warriors equipped with light spears.
Again, which is correct?

Any advice will be greatly appreciated.

Both are true: they are "irregular" in tye sense that they do not use the
complex, highly disciplined formations employed bby the Five Empires, but
they also have uniforms and weapons supplied by the cities and towns that
supply them. So their uniforms are "regular." They just lack training but
make up for it in bravery and ferocity. Don't limit troops to either
illustrations or to the brief descriptions: the Ghatoni fight well with
swords, but they also have light spears. This is one of the signs of their
"irregularity."

Great! You are doing exactly what needs to be done! The problem with other
rules sets is that they often do not easily represent the societal
complexities of Tekumel, nor the complexity of the world itself. Other
rules can be modified and "tweaked," bbut I would like to see a full set
for the planet, representing exactly what it has. Maybe I hope for too
much... Thanks for your efforts!

I don't "know" the rules for Den-den, but I know enough about the game to
work them out. This will take some time, but it can be done. I have
realised that there is some interest out there in Den-den, and when I get
them into shape I will happily share them with you all.

Tekumel certainly suffers from a lack of adequate marketing.
I don't know enough about the FRPG business to say for sure,
but part of the problem from my point of view is that Tekumel
IS different.  It can't be tossed into the "dragons and paladins"
scene AT ALL.

Additionally, Tekumel is a work of art and not a game.  That's 
its real problem in my mind.  Tekumel is a social artwork, it's
a ship-in-a-bottle dreamed up by a man with a unique set of skills.
To mass-market Tekumel, you have to give it to big, established company.
Big, established companies have a product pipeline to support, and turning
out "art" is not part of the scene.

To do Tekumel right, a large company would need to allow itself to be
educated as to exactly what the game is.  Either that, or they need to
invest in Professor Barker, without attempting to control the product.
Most aren't willing to do that.  Tome, a smaller company, was.

:  "in charge", "scanner", "hire", "showing", "sell"...

The problem here is that's what we'd all like to do who are involved
in any way in the production of Barker's stuff.  The problem is
1) you're never in charge, it's always compromise, 2) scanning and
correlating stuff TAKES TIME, and if no one is drawing a paycheck
to do it, then you have to do it in your spare time, 3) hiring people
takes a lot more resources than anyone has 4) self-marketing (showing)
the product takes lots of time, money and energy, and 5) you can't
sell anyone on anything without money.


I for one appreciate your frustration with the glacial pace at which 
Tekumel products come out.  But life is that you get bogged down in
minutiae -- you scan in the page, and something hiccoughs, and now
one more day is spent rebuilding your computer or debugging your
scanner, and the whole thing gets pushed back a day.

What really needs to happen is that a big game company, a real
Daddy Warbucks comes along and says "Ah, Professor Barker, here's
a full art, marketing, and sales staff, you just sit there and 
write, and if your computer has a problem we'll send in one of our
hardware support personnel."  

Seeing as that's not likely, here's the flip side:  one of the benefits
for the slow way in which the game is produced is, to sound naieve, 
artistic integrity.  Barker's stuff comes out slow because it's
his, not someone else's.  It hasn't been molded to fit someone else's
view of the world.

[more big plans omitted]

Your big plans are great, but as pointed out before there are problems.
First off...  INVESTMENT CAPITAL.  What you're talking about is 
EXPENSIVE.  Go line up someone to pitch in the cash, and be prepared
to give most of it back to them.

Second, if you think you can do this, contact Professor Barker and
pitch it to him.  I'm sure he'd love to see these things take place.
These big ideas take lots of work that is not immediately rewarded.

: Pictures, images, words, a vision: that's what sells about Tekumel,
: not rules.

I think you're a hundred percent right about this.

: Again, I am not saying that I believe the product to be inferior,
: or that I did not receive fair value for my money, I'm just saying
: that the market for the current products is too narrow, and the
: market for other products could be much broader.

This may be true.  I think the underlying reality is that unless
someone were being paid to do these things on a full-time basis,
the current slow pace of production is bound to be maintained.

If you've ever been in a truly crowded place, you'll notice that people
stink.  Compared to other game worlds, Tekumel TEAMS with people.

It's not simply a lack of marketing, as I argue, but trying to
sell the wrong product.

Instead, that is in fact part of its VALUE.  It may never be mass
market, but there is a significant market of older gamers that
appreciate sophisticated work.  Tekumel can appeal to a larger market.

Yes, Tekumel is a piece of art, of social fiction, and it should be
marketed as such.

> To mass-market Tekumel, you have to give it to big, established company.
> Big, established companies have a product pipeline to support, and turning

No big established company, with in my mind the possible exception of
Chaosium, would ever take on Tekumel.  Most big companies have their
own rule sets, and the modules tied to them.  The other obvious exception
is Steve Jackson Games, the machine that eats liscences.  But as much as
I respect Steve Jackson, it would not be appropriate for him to do it.
It would simply become another unsupported module for GURPS.

No, I think a small company could either do it themselves, or raise the
capital to take on the development costs, then farm out the finished
product to a larger company.  I would argue that Chaosium would be
decent possibility for that, as at two of the games they publish have
a distinct social science angle: RuneQuest, and especially Pendragon.
Also, the people who run Chaosium as well as the main contributors 
are very intelligent and educated people, who would respect Barker. 

> To do Tekumel right, a large company would need to allow itself to be

This is actually unnecessary.  I believe that the fans could capitalize
the product development, and then sell the finished or near finished
product to, for example, Chaosium.  If I were a game company, and some
one offered me a well crafted, nearly finished product, I'd factor in
the small development cost in my decision whether to market it.

This is impossible, and not worth trying.  The people who already
understand Barker's value are the ones who should capitalize development.

> Most aren't willing to do that.  Tome, a smaller company, was.

In my opinion, TOME didn't exert enough editorial or marketing
control over Prof. Barker.

I think you could get volunteers.  I know that if it were legally
possible to do so, I would personally, and in less than 90 days,
scan in everything I owned (which, while not EVERYTHING, is a lot).

So far...

Ahhh...money...that is the question.

And the answer is: the money IS out there!  Yes.  I KNOW it is.
Here's how to raise it.

I know there are people willing to pay a great deal of money of Barker's
stuff.  I know, because I buy EPT stuff at Flea Markets and odd game
stores, and re-sell it on the InterNet for a handsome profit.  So far,
it's about enough to pay for all the stuff I kept for my personal
collection.  Old Tekumel stuff is about as hot as old RuneQuest stuff.
So there are some deep pockets out there chasing Tekumel.
For example, I COULD get my hands on a typewritten review copy of Swords and
Glory signed by Barker.  Guess how much I could get for it?  More than
a Black Lotus, I can tell you that.

In a real business, I would try to sell STOCK in such a venture, but I
can't.  It's not a large enough business.  However, I know there are
people who overvalue Barker.  If I could sell something to them to raise
money, there are those who would buy it.  I'd put $100 without thinking,
and depending on how you marketed it, you could string a lot of people
along say $25-$100 at a time.

What I'd sell are preliminary or review copies of the various products,
maybe in pieces (for example, a book in three parts), and make it limited
edition, signed by Barker.  Good production values are easy to obtain
with laser printers and copy places.

There needs to be more people working on it.  I'm certain that there
are poor fanatics who could not afford to invest money in Barker,
can could invest time, and who have access to computers.  If the
text was available electronically, then a larger number of people
could collaborate on it, sorting, indexing, etc.

I can do it.

Outline your capital needs: what equipment you need, what marginal
income would enable the main participants to devote significant
time to the project.  Consider what work could be done by other volunteers,
especially menial work based on already published sources.

Be realistic and fair.  The money would be raised from fans, not a big
game company.  But if it made the difference, and SOMETHING could be
produced as a return on the investment, then it would fly.

> Second, if you think you can do this, contact Professor Barker and

I imagine he reads this newsgroup.  As it is, my newsreader won't let
me read or compose outside it, so I can't easily re-email this to him.

 
> This may be true.  I think the underlying reality is that unless

It may well require one person full time, and I doubt that it could
be Barker (unless he's retired or owns significant real estate).
But consider better use of volunteers.  I'm sure you'd find many
eager people willing to help.  Also, graduate students are made to
be abused: I suggest Barker consider doing so.  It would be a legitimate
exercise to have a student examine and summarize Barker's work as a
piece of social fiction from the perspective of social science.
Sounds like a thesis to me.

Let me think about the numbers.  Basically, I think a lot of people
would pay at least $25 a chunk for the promise of limited edition
EPT stuff in the future, but maybe $100 is a better point.  And those
who can't afford to invest can afford to work.

I've helped make an awful lot of things happen in my life so far, and I'd
be happy to add one more thing to that list...

Yes, denden must be very different, probably closer to checkers or
backgammon (i.e. a game of movement, probably simpler than chess).
I read an encyclopedia of world games, and I can't quite remember,
but the largest class of games is called something like Albuquerque.
They are race and capture games with a limited set of counters, usually
stones or seeds, placed and moved on positions connected by lines.
I think 9-man's morris is an example.  Hardly any modern games are of this
class, but they are still popular in the southern hemisphere and
Central Asia.  I would not at all be surpised if denden was in that
family.

Thanks very much. That helps clear up some of our confusion, much of which is
based upon assumptions about Tekumel which are drawn from Earth history. 
Tekumel is, of course, very different, but where we lack information we fill in
as  best we can.

With regard to the swords and javelins: we have two options. We can (1) class
them as Swordsmen equipped with javelins (javelins in our rules do not confer
a ranged missile capability, but add to initial impact and the enhanced effects
of supporting rear ranks), or (2) we can call them Spearmen. I actually favor
option (1), which lets them hit harder on the initial round.

Part of the reason for going into this detail is that a friend is really
interested in building a Ghatoni army in 15mm. He is even willing to commission
Richard Kerr, onetime head of Ral Partha's sculpting section, to sculpt
Ghatoni infantry and Serudla for him.

Thanks again.

	I work at a game store and I think that what Tekumel needs most (other than the rules) is a magazine. Storys give referees ideas and get people 
comfortable with the world, of Tekumel. I think that if you wish for Tekumel to be spread to people other than friends of the "Old Guard" a magazine helps 
tremendously. It also lend an air of legitimacy to a game system that most people have not heard of and know nothing about. Hopefully the game can get a boost

I've not explained myself too well... :-)

We started with a "scientific" explanation of the world (genesis and
phisical laws) and we inferred as this world might have been influenced
the philosophies and religions of the population of this world.
It is somewhat of a limited point of view, I admit, but we can't be
omniscent and consider all factors determining and influencing the
religious thoughts of a population!

And as to make sense: we developed the thought that RPs are not (no
more) spawn of simulation games, they have developed in a new narrative
form (closer to movie, poem, literature, thatre... than to war games or
board games) and in this view, I think all worlds you may imagine of
with this narrative form, should make sense "narratively". If your genre
is "nonsense", "nonsense" should make sense... If your genre is "classic
heroic fantasy", you should be bind to what you would be expected to
find in "classic heroic fantasy" (think of Conan or tLotR): black and
white, all or nothing, hero or honourless villain.

 > of awe and mystery to it, a feeling that some things must be left to

Religion may be also self exploration, fear, superstition,
illumination... you may explore one thousand of aspects of religion in
one thousand of campaigns...

Thanks for the support! The new map is now complete and is being shipped

Excellent! The Ghatoni can be classed as swordsmen, with javelins (your
option 1). You could set aside a second unit and class it as light
irregular spearmen if you need scouts or irregulars to harass more
stationary units.I want to see the finished figures! They sound great.

Anyone one this list who doesn't know of it should check out
_The Eye of All-Seeing Wonder_.  It is consistently excellent.

Issue #4 came out about a month ago.  It is on a semi-regular
schedule; expect 3-4 issues a year.

The Eye is produced, and mainly written, in the UK.  David
Morris was the editor for the first four issues, but he has 
just announced Steve Foster will be taking over.

Articles have included:
Detailed clan write-ups (2-3 pgs), Adventure scenarios, 
rules opions (GURPS-Tekumel is popular), Cultural pieces,
and a slow chapter-by-chapter release of _Tirikelu_, 
Morris' Pendragon/GURPS-ish rules custom-tailored for
Tekumel.

Subscriptions:
3L per issue (UK)
3.50L per issue (Europe)
$6 per issue (USA)

Send money to:

The Hokun riding beasts are about as intelligent as Earth warhorses -- not
much more. They can bite and strike with their modified feet (they are
quadripedal, with the top pair of arms atrophied and used for feeding),
but they don't use weapons or have the intelligence to speak or act much
on their own. They are hunched, swaybacked so that a kind of saddle can be
put on them, and still cloudily translucent, though not as transparent as
their masters are. The Hokun are rather set in their preferences for
weapons: long "glass" lances, swords, and armour that is made of the same
extruded stuff their weapons are made of. They have daggers, crossbows,
some magic, and are also ale to use the weapons of the Ancients found in
ruined cities here and there. Their riding beasts are quite fast and are
able to run down a human being. I can't give you better statistics than
this, unfortunately. The Hokun are dangerous opponents, and my gaming
groups give them a wide berth!

I'm going to be too busy demonstrating my own games at Gen Con to
volunteer to run any EPT/Tekumel, but if TOMe don't have a booth
this year, might I informally suggest that Tekumel-heads could
use the Hogshead Publishing booth as an informal place to meet up,
hang out and chat? We'll be on booth 320, a corner booth at the
back of the main hall.

Why? Well, I'm a Tekumel nut in withdrawal after a long-running
campaign went into stasis earlier this year; and the latest issue
of our magazine, INTERACTIVE FANTASY, talks about EPT and Tekumel
at some length in two of its articles. Hint hint, plug plug.

I was flipping through a travel magazine the other day and came upon an article
on fungi. This got me to thinking about the use of fungi as food on Tekumel.
I began to wonder if this might have some religious connotations. Some of the
ideas I have begun to develop are as follows:
 
Fungi and Religion
Certain religions, in particular the temples of Sarku and Durritlamish, view
even be cultivated, harvested, and sold fresh or dried and exported.
fungi as sacred food. They spring from dead things, so must be a gift of the
God of death and undeath. These fungi might be consumed in rituals, some of
which might contribute to religious visions. They could also be cultivated
in the underworlds and consumed as delicacies or common food.
 
I feel that the temples of Hru'u and Ksarul would also favor the consumption
of fungi, and might even purchase hallucinogenic varieties from the Sarku and
Durrit temples. They would not view it as such a holy food, however. The
temples of Belkhanu and Qon might also favor these foods.
 
I see the temples of Vimuhla and Chiteng as completely eschewing fungi, as the
spawn of Sarku and his servant Missum. I am not sure what doctrinal opinion
might be held by worshippers of Avanthe and Dilinalia, although I am of the
opinion that Avanthe temples would take no particular position. Most other
temples would take no interest in this question.
 
Where to Find Fungi
Just like on earth, fungus grow better in damp, cool conditions. Thus, the
underworlds would be outstanding locations for growth of fungi. Certain
locales would also breed fungi well, such as around Purdimal, where the
variety of different types would be staggering. In some of these are type may
even be cultivated, harvested, and sold fresh or dried and exported.
 
Uses of Fungi
Fungal growths may be used for food, to make drugs, and in religious services
as mentioned above. Some types, found only in the deepest underworlds or in
the furthest reaches of the barbarian mountains, may sell as delicacies for
hundreds of kaitars for a single gram. Especially those that not only taste
good, but impart "altered reality" to the eater. Other varieties may be ground
into powders and used as spices or consumed as drugs for medicinal or
recreational purposes.
 
Appearances of Fungi
Tekumelyani fungi are at least as diverse as those found on earth. An edible
mushroom particularly favored by Sarku worshippers and found only in the
underworld is known as the Deathhead, because it vaguely resembles as
small human skull. Another, the Scepter of Belkhanu, appears as a long staff
topped by a small golden knob. Some edible fungi have disguised themselves as
food of the Ssu, so the collector must be very careful in his attempts to
harvest.
 
Just some initial thoughts on an admittedly odd topic.
Any additional thoughts or comments are welcome and encouraged. Maybe I'll
experiment with some recipes and post those as well.

you've fallen and you can't get up.

#1.  Reality is not bound to observe our definitions.  It is not
relative.  It is not based on our perceptions.

#2.  Sanity and Insanity are legal definitions.  An insane person is
one judged to be legally incapable of taking responsibility for their
actions.  Lots of crazy people are not (yet?) certified insane.

#3.  While I believe there is One God, others may differ.  However,
one's ability or inability to discern purpose does not affect the
sanity or insanity of God.  It might affect the perceiver's sanity.

#4.  Religions and FRP are tightly coupled.  What kind of FRP does not
have a church, temple, monastery, priest, acolyte, healer, shaman, or
philosopher?  I submit it would be boring.

#5.  Professor Barker has excellently described the religions of
Tekumel in his gaming material, DAW paperbacks, and magazine articles,
columns, and interviews.  

Use your imagination.  DEFINE A PURPOSE IF YOU CANNOT EASILY FIND ONE. 
Then use scientific methods to fit your model to your fantasy world's
reality.  Let your players discover how it works by playing the game.

Perhaps your initial model was based on a get-rich-quick-scheme.  Then
you discover (hopefully through your players) that there is a God or
Gods (or not?) and they want to get even with the charlatans (or the
con artists want the party for exposing their charade).  Or whatever.

People do self publish serials on the net. The one that comes to mind
is the work of Elf Sternberg, which is an erotic sci-fi cum fantasy
epic published and distributed as a series of journal entries.
There are less pornographic examples too!
(The woman having sex with a dragon was quite Tekumelish in it's
sheer magnitude!)

Of course we have a real problem. Few of us believe in a deity. To
a Christian or a Buddhist, the faith in the divine is fundamental and
in many ways more mundane than to those of us who see it as fantastical.

I think we who are atheist or agnostic need to realise that gods can be
viewed as "the very big people".

GURPS Mad World also showed a world where gods were very real, but insane,
so that people actively avoided them.

I once commented that the President of the United States was insane.
The person I was talking to looked at me and insisted to know what I 
meant by that.  I replied, "Because he thinks he's qualified to be
President of the United States."

Someone who thinks he's smart enough to run the world must be insane.

Likewise for Gods.  Gods are by definition insane, because sanity is
relative.  Are WE sane, to ants?  Can they discern our purposes? 
Can they avoid our feet or our shovels?  Do they understand why one
moment life is checked cloth and soda pop, and the next thing they
know they're being crushed en masse?

Gods are insane, and they can't be avoided.

And I'm shocked. I have a few volumes of the older rules versions, but 
have never run the game for my group. I've been trying to get one 
comprehensive set of rules; I don't think that's too much to ask for, but 
it seems the Tekumel people disagree.
And what do I discover when I open the box? This rules set is INCOMPLETE! 
Another expensive, misleading purchase. I'm very disappointed. I pull out 
the Player's Guide, and every page refers me to previously-published, not-
included, SOLO ADVENTURES? For RULES?  What are you thinking??? 
I'm extremely disappointed. I liked what I've read of Tekumel, I read the 
Daw books, and when I learned about this new boxed set of rules I thought 
I'd finally have something COMPLETE to enjoy. Frankly, this seems more 
like a scam than anything else. In fifteen years of role-playing I've 
never been taken like this. I don't care how intriguing the world is; 
this was a BIG mistake.

Again, as has been said elsewhere, what Tekumel needs most is MONEY. A
magazine cannot be produced without MONEY. This, we ain''t got. With the
sort of investment one of the big companies can throw into a game ANYTHING
can be done. I have approved ideas for magazines, modules, computer games,
and all sorts of other game-aids, but these take perseverance and talent
to produce, then they take MONEY. TOME, at least, is trying to produce the
basics.

Wes Postelthaite (Sorry if I mangled the spelling of his name) will be
doing some miniature events at Gen-Con. Wes is part of PHD games, the
people putting out the 25mm Tekumel minatures. I will be attending, but I
am running a RuneQuest adventure (taking up 3 slots total), playing in
Wes's games (another 2), plus whatever else I can fit in. If (and it is a
big IF) I have time, I might be able to run my Tekumel event that I am
going to run at Ben-Con (the nations first all benefit convention) this
June. No promises, however. 

I would make time to play in any Tekumel events that anybody else may be
running. The last Tekumel role-palying event at Gen-Con I know of was
Victor Raymond's event ~3 years ago.

Please tell us what you think about the typesetting, 
quality of artwork, completeness of rules, ans so on.

Rather than engage in vitriolic counterpoint, I am hoping 
that any temporary setbacks (such as described in an 
earlier post) can be corrected by creating an errata 
sheet or two.  

If another product is required to play the game, it 
should be clearly marked on the outside of the box as 
well as in the adverts.  However, we're all adults and we
can "take it".  Let's just make certain we have the full 
list *somewhere* so we can play the game.

I don't have $100.00 for new rules (at least not in one 
fell swoop, my wife would have *me* impaled).  Therefore,
I want to carefully plan the acquisition of the new rules.

All of you who are actually in possession of the new rules,
especially those who are playing under them, please respond!

Thanks.

Sorry you didn't like the set. I have been pleading with TOME to reissue
the Sourcebook in its entirety (3 vols.). They say they can only afford it
if the new rules sell. They could not afford a bigger and more
comprehensive rules set either since it would put the price of the set way
above what ANYBODY would be willing to pay for it! Tekumel is just too
complex a world to be jammed into one "world book." or rules set. The solo
adventures are referred to because they contain BACKGROUND. The new
published rules have all one needs for combat, movement, magic, magical
items, nonplayer characters, and the like. I wish there were some way to
give folks like you a sourcebook and a rules set all in the same bundle,
but, as I said, the price in today's publishing world would be WAY out of
sight. I tried to be more "complete" in the first "Empire of the Petal
Throne" rules, but they were riddled with gaps and "easy" compromises.
There's no intention to "scam" you. Believe me, we worked hard to provide
a set of RULES that covers enough to adventure with. If you need
BACKGROUND, you can refer to the solo adventures: they do fit into the
"rules" since they produce rounded player characters with personal
histories, talents, possessions, etc. who fit into the world. What TOME
has just issued is meant to be RULES for those who need to codify and
quantify their parties' actions and set up nonplayer characters and
scenarios with which to interact. It is manifestly impossible to fit ALL
of Tekumel into such a single boxed set!

A game is a simulation of an environment plus some sort of story line that
leads toward a goal. Monopoly, for example is a very simplistic picture of
Atlantic City, New Jersey, in the early thirties. It can be put into one
box in its entirety because the simulation leaves out vast amounts of
"irrelevant" data that could have enhanced a more complex game: property
taxes, city government structures, federal and state institutions,
corruption at various levels, all sorts of "politics," etc. When
roleplaying games got started, Arneson and Gygax put all that they wanted
to simulate into three booklets in one little box. People -- myself
included -- kept seeing more and more things we wanted to add to their
simulation. I took my world of Tekumel out of mothballs and decided to
make a "game" out of it. (I had "gamed" Tekumel in the forties but without
codified, written rules.) My first published game, "Empire of the Petal
Throne," contained more features than most other contemporary roleplaying
attempts of the time: Tekumel's clans, religions, governments, social
structures, etc. were all given all-too-brief descriptions and were
slapped into the rules-set. Many features had to be left out. As time
passed, and players kept demanding more details, the world became much
more complicated -- and difficult to describe in any short fashion. Now
it's so intricate that I have to keep character lists in my computer
database, and another author is currently preparing a tome (no pun
intended) on the Tekumalani deities and their sects.

I am sorry we had to do it this way. Many who already have backgrounds in
Tekumel will find these rules easy to use. They will already own a lot of
the previously published materials. Beginners will not require much more
than what is presented here to develop introductory adventures. You seem
to be in an intermediate group who want (and deserve) more source material
and were expecting a single boxed game to contain the whole world of
Tekumel, PLUS rules. I wish I could help. You can ask TOME for your money
back -- or you can bug them to republish the Sourcebook so you'll have all
the details of the various societies of the planet.  When you consider
that certain other major roleplaying games cost five hundred dollars or
more to acquire even a large portion of the sourcebooks, playing aids,
scenario packs, etc. etc., I don't see this as such a bad deal.

What I am coming to is this: the new game is a set of RULES (plus some
background materials, spells, magic items, etc.). It is NOT a "complete"
game in the sense that Monopoly is a "complete" simulation of the
extracted features of an imaginary "Atlantic City." Very few roleplaying
games these days are "complete" in that holistic sense. Most require
"world books" or game aids or other forms of background material, and the
complex ones require further modules to present distant regions, minor
societies, special species, intricate political and social details that
would not be enjoyed by all (e.g. the mechanics of buying and running a
fief, politicking in the higher circles of the ruler's court, etc.). These
are in addition to the usual "dungeon" modules that fill up the
game-stores.

Well, I wish you were happier. But one cannot please everyody. By all
means, please return your game to TOME and ask for your money back. If
they don't agree, let me know and I'll see what I can do.

I just recieved teh new rules and was suprised that no generation rules for
standard humans were present.  I own these rules separately from the "solo"
adventures, but they should have been included.  So far what little I have
browsed seems to be nicely done.  The artwork is pleasant, and volume 3 is of
great use in running a game.  The first two volumes reprint much of S&G volume
2, while these are somewhat clearer I was hoping for more.  Also no non/semi
intelligent beasties included in rules, although I again have the Bestiary. 
This is not as important as character rules which really should have been
included.  I know TOME is a business, and they already have these rules out,
but a stripped down version could have easily been included.  The map is very
nice, as are all the maps ever printed for Tekumel games.  I do like the
archetypes and their illustrations.  A little bit
of background and an index would also have been nice. As it stands it is quite
nice for those of us who already own previous materials, but lack too much for
those interested in it as a new game.

Well, just got home and found the new Tekumel RPG rules waiting on my
doorstep. Boy was I excited, it felt like Christmas. So as a service to
others, I am sharing my initial impressions of the new rules.

I must admit that I am disapointed with the results of Gardasiyal. I
acknowledge all the work that people put in writing it, but I feel that
given the current state of the art in role-playing rules, a much better
product could have been produced (not that I want to try it though). But
first, for those who care, I will review the new rules.

What's included:
   Three stapled-bound, glossy magazine-covered rule books, Vol 1 is the        
   player's guide. Vol 2 is Sorcery & Spells, Vol 3 is the Referee's Guide.
   A two sided, full color, glossy map of the five empires. Covers the same 
   area as the one in S&G, but no hexes, but much better graphics.
   A few staple bound sheets that make up the Character Archetypes and the 
   Player's Character Sheets.
   Two 10-sided dice, and two 6-sided dice.
   A full color box to keep everything in.

What's not included:
   No background of Tekumel
   No descriptions of the creatures met in Tekumel (you need the Tekumel 
      Besitary for this, although their stats are included).
   No rules for creating basic characters (You need Vol 1 of Adv in Tekumel)

I personally feel that all three should be included in some form,
especially character creation. It is INCOMPLETE with out this. Imagine a
new player to Tekumel, and you buy the product and find that you can't
even create a character! You have to buy a seperate book that you can't
even find anymore. Come on TOME, loosen up and include Vol 1 of Adventures
in Tekumel in the box. It is required for playing the game!

A brief description of the world (ala EPT) could have been easily
included. 5-6 pages ain't going to break the bank. And the creatures could
have been somewhat descibed, at least the major intellegent non-humans.
Give me a break. OK enough bitching about what's not in the game. What
about that is in the box.

First an overall comment on the 3 books. Compared to most other RPG's the
rule books are fairly cheaply constructed. Simple staple binding and a
glossy cover. About the same as Deluxe RQ books that AH brought out 10
years ago. The internal layout is not very good either. No index, no table
of contents, and a very poor look. The artwork as a whole reminds me of
RPG's of the late 70's some of it good, most fairly poor. 

Volume 1, the Player's guide, is 46 pages long and has seven sections.
Section 1 contains rules on modifing characters rolled up with the Vol 1
of Adventures in Tekumel so that non-humans can be played. (Yea
non-humans, Boo! I need another book for basic character generation and
skill lists, actually a very LOUD BOO!)

Section 2 contains extensive price list of goods, including arms, armor,
adventuring gear, clothing, jewellery, gems, food & beverages, drugs,
poisons, lodging, housing costs (including building your own clan-house),
transport & shipping prices, slaves, and entertainers. Very nice and
detailed. Great work.

Section 3 contain the movement rules, tactical and strategic. Seems OK.

Section 4 is combat. Two systems are presented a quick play version and a
more detailed hit-point version. It's basically a re-done, simplified
version of the S&G rules. The initiative modifiers are nice, e.g attacking
with a long spear gives one a +5 to initiative (on a D20) for the first
round, but a -5 on the remaining rounds. Overall my impression of the
combat rules is, while better than S&G's cumbersome system, are still too
chart dependant. You compare you HBS vs your opponent's to get your basic
chance to hit, modify that with a rather long list of modifiers and roll
to hit. If you hit, you then find what combat table you use, and then roll
on it. In the Quick Play (QP) your hits can have either no effect, minor,
serious, critical, or kill results. If playing with Hit Points, you take
the wound result and roll again to determine hit points lost. Whew! A nice
section on NPC morale is included, as well as a healing section and a
section on mass combat (not for military battles, but rather fights with
more than about 10 combatants per side.

Section 5 contains guidelines for other adventure actions, use of skills,
etc. A very light coverage of the subject.

Section 6 covers experience points and how to use them. I have a personal
dislike for most EP system, and this one is no exception, especially since
it rewards characters for defeating oppenents only. I thought this type of
system went out with basic D&D. It is extremely disappointing that the
"officia" Tekumel rules gives experience only for killing things. I
thought RPG's had developed beyond that. Throw that system out and just
give PC's EP's for accomplishing tasks, not for killing every little
Dri-ant they step on.

Section 7 is Income and Expenditures. It is simple, but seems quite
adequate. I like simple.

Volume 2 is the spell book. It is 62 pages long, with two sections. 
Section 8 contains the rules of spell casting a simplified version of the
S&G rules.

Section 9 is the spell corpus It appears that all the spells from S&G are
here.   I personally consider the spells the crowing achievement of the
S&G rules, and they are repeated here and once again, outshine everything
else.

Volume 3 is the Referee's guide, the longest book at 78 pages with 6 sections.
Section 10 is Encounters. Random encounter charts for any occasion.
Encounter charts are a crutch for the GM, but can be useful for getting an
idea of the creatures roaming around in certain areas. Rules for surprise
and amush are included here. 

Section 11 Covers basic rules for NPC's, including NPC reactions and
personality traits and random tables for special equipment they may have.

Section 12 is the Treasure section. It includes charts for what type of
treasure is found in certain areas, e.g. Animal lairs, Mercants & Nobles,
etc.  A rather worthless section. Once again, a throw-back to the orginal
D&D rules.

Section 13 details the magic items: 45 eyes, 31 amulets, 30 misc magic
items and 31 magic books are covered in great detail. Rules for magic
scrolls, magic arms and armor are also covered. Very nice and seems to be
quite complete. At 38 pages it is the longest section in the book and 2nd
longest in the entire set. M'mm spells take 50 pages and magic items 38. I
guess we know where Prof Barker's interests lie (and I absolutely agree).

Section 14 is the standard EPT divine intervention rules. Simple, hard to
get, and watch out for retribution.

Section 15 has some basic ideas for adventures to run PC's through. A nice
section to have, and done fairly well.

The map as mentioned above is two-sided, full-color, glossy 17"x21" in
size. It is very nice. No hexes, so keep the old map around for distances,
but I love this map. Some real nice cartography really adds to the feel of
the world. You can really appreciate the difficulty the Tsolyani faced in
invading Yan Kor. The front contains Livyanu, Shenyu, Mu'ugalavya, Yan
Kor, Tsolyanu, and the western part of Salarvya. The reverse contains the
remainder of Salarvya, THe plains of Glass, Mihallu, and the rest. No new
territory, just the same as the old map but completely different. The map
is also surrounded by glyphs of the 10 gods and 10 cohorts on front and
other stylized symbols on the back. I'm not sure exactly what they are but
they are pretty.

The box is full color, both top and bottom. The front shows some
adventures encountering the Hokun via tube-car and they aren't in good
shape. Unfortunately, I don't like this particular piece of artwork. The
back is much nicer (TOME used it in their flyer) and is a picture of a
young girl being dressed with a city with its pyarmids in the background.
Very nice.

Over all I rate this RPG as very disappointing. I don't feel ripped-off
and deceived like a previous poster, but after waiting so long I am quite
sad, since this game won't sell. People expect more from their game
systems these days. It would have been a great achievement for 1975, but
for 1995, it is third-rate. I can forgive the somewhat cheap components.
Tekumel has limited appeal and TOME is hedging their investment. Gamers
expect more than is given in this set. Non-Tekumel fans won't touch this
game, and why should they, when vastly superior products are on the market
at a lower cost. I was very excited when I got home this evening and found
that the game had arrived. Now I am very sad, since I see this as the end
of the line for Tekumel products. This game won't sell at all well, thus
TOME will give up on Tekumel, sigh! What I thought was a new beginning,
now seems like the end. Oh, well, I will go out and buy another one, It
will be a real collector's item some day. Not many people will buy it. 
I can't blame them, but I am very disappointed.

My severe critisism of the product should not be taken in any form as an
attack on the authors, contributors, or TOME. I appreciate their effort,
and I know how much work was put into it. I was hoping for a product that
could re-vitalize the gaming world of Tekumel to outsiders. Unfortunately,
the game is only suitable to those already sold on the world. Heavy Sigh!
The map, the magic spells, and magic items are great. But it isn't enough.
More had to be done. There needed to be more content. It needed to be a
complete game that a newbie could get hooked on. As it stands now, a
neophyte who bought this will feel ripped-off and that is too bad. I'm at
a loss for words. It feels that I am now writting an ephitate for Tekumel.
I hope this in not the case. I love the world too much.

Well, I've been a bit long winded, but its time to end this post.  It will
be interesting to see how others feel about the new game.

I'm still waiting for my copy of the rules, but I'm suprised to hear that 
you own the solor rules (as I do) but are still suprised that there's no 
human character generation in the new boxed set.  I went back and looked 
over the white book in particular, and they made no secret whatsoever of 
their intention for it to function as the character generation rules for 
the 'upcoming roleplaying game'.

While it certainly is *unusual* for a boxed game to come out without full 
character generation rules, and while I agree that it may drive away 
potential new players (though aren't the solo books meant to draw new 
players in?), it shouldn't come as a suprise to anyone who already has 
those solo books.

Question: (though with any luck I'll get my copy in a day or two anyway, 
and can look this up for myself): I heard a mention of NPC generation 
rules being included in the boxed set - are those fleshed out enough to 
function as 'bare bones' PC generation, if needed?

If not, might it not be possible to write up & circulate such a thing?  
Maybe as a 1-sheet insert to the box?

Thanks for the comments. I, too, wish that we could have included the
character generation rules AND the Bestiary in this boxed set, but many
players have the separately published versions already, and they would no
doubt have screamed at the extra price needed to print and box these
previously printed items along with the rules. At today's publishing
costs, it would have added $40-$50 to the price. The box was always
intended to contain just the RULES for roleplaying. The beginner does get
the beautifully drawn archetypes, and thus have some characters with
backgrounds and stats to start off with. The advanced player will already
own the first "Adventures on Tekumel" book, which provides the character
generation system, as well as the Bestiary. These new rules will fill in a
major gap for him/her. The truly advanced player will want the nonhuman
stat-generating rules included in the new rules set but will have all the
other stuff, including "Ebon Bindings," "Deeds of the ever Glorious," the
old Zocchi Sourcebook, etc. There is just no way to get these things ALL
into one box! This should not really bother people used to separate
"monster books," "gods and goddesses books," etc. etc. I owned a veritable
stack of such game-aids and modules when I first started to roleplay.
Other games have developed "world books" to describe a single planet (with
one domindant species), a region, a single civilisation, a single mythos,
etc. Tekumel is so big and contains so many different cultures, species,
and features that ONE "world book" would e har put to do the job. The old
Sourcebook covered the societies of northern Tekumel, but it didn't
include the "monsters"; the Bestiary fills that role but doesn't go into
much detail about the intelligent nonhumans' cultures. I still want to do
a "city" book so that people can see how a major Tekumelani city operates
and can find their way around the Imperial bureaucracies with some ease.

I think that beginners will indeed have a tough time with Tekumel. They
always have. NO set of rules can include enough to make the planet
familiar to newcomers. Remember that most sword-and-sorcery fantasy
roleplaying rules are based on familiar (to Americans) images: dragons,
castles, knights, ape-like critters, lions and tigers and bears...! I
remember that even vampires in tuxedoes were once included in one popular
"monster" list. We all instantly recognise the comicbook,
Saturday-afternoon-matinee, TV-series-beasts, but nobody knows what an
Ahoggya is, or a Pe Choi, or a Dlaqo. In the first "Empire of the Petal
Throne" I offered two or three line descriptions of the "critters," but
this caused more complaints than I had ever imagined: people were not
satisfied with such short introductions to a wholly unfamiliar "monster"
or alien race. Hence, the Bestiary. The character generation book came
about for similar reasons: it's easy to present dice rolls for the usual
statistics: "strength," "build," etc., but this does not present these
"stats" in any meaningful societal context. Tekumel's societies are very
different from those familiar to North Americans. So I developed the
character roll-up book, which has societal materials and "background"
included along with the "stats." I then added solo adventures which
present still more background: how the armies, temples, and clans work,
how shopping is done, how to travel, how the countryside looks, etc. etc.
Characters developed during these "adventures" can be introduced into any
roleplaying game, replete with background, possessions, interests, and
experience. I didn't want the rules themselves to be incomplete, however,
and so I devised the archetypes as a compromise: pre-rolled characters
>from  a variety of backgrounds and with a variety of skills. They are
enough for the beginner -- and probably enough also for the intermediate
player. As I said above,the advanced player may want to roll up a
character from scratch and will require the white book. This should be no
big obstacle: many games require the use of books other than the central
rulebook. All in all, the Tekumel "set" is still somewhat cheaper than
those of certain other major games.

TOME is a small company and is pressed for cash.There won't be any more
Tekumel materials unless this game makes money. Sorry, but those are the
economic facts. Shortcuts have to be taken, but I still think players are
getting their money's worth, at least in today's inflated market.

I'm glad you like the map. Please send copies of your letters to TOME so
that they are apprised of your needs, likes, and dislikes. I am sure they
will do whatever they can.

Yes, fungi are a common food source, particularly in the great rainforests
of Pan Chaka. The Pachi Lei make much use of several species. Others are
poisonous or emit dangerous spores. Sarku's worshippers cultivate a
particular black fungus for food, Dried, this is used as an amulet to ward
off various animals.

I don't recall hallucinogenic fungi being used by the temples of Ksarul
and Hru'u, but then, I was never one for pharmacology. It's quite
possible. Belkhanu and Qon do not prefer fungi but make no rules against
them. There are special fungi named for Belkhanu, for Qon (the "Risen
Lord," which is small, pallid white with yellow markings, and is deadly to
small animals, children, etc. but not to adult humans -- it is said to
taste like creamy pudding and to cause delightful dreams).

You are correct. Vimuhla, Chiteng, Karakan, Chegarra, and Dilinala argue
that fungi are "of the dark" and should not be eaten, although there is no
total prohibition. They can be consumed in times of starvation.

I am not sure what doctrinal opinion might be held by worshippers of
Avanthe and Dilinala, although I am of the opinion that Avanthe temples
would take no particular position. Most other temples would take no
interest in this question.

Avanthe treats fungi as part of the natural cycle of life/death, and as
long as these parasites are not connected directly with the Dark Gods, She
has no problems with them.

Absoutely correct. Try Penom, though, for really horrendous fungi -- some
semi-sentient, some as tall as a house! The things grow in a riot of
colours, textures, and shapes. They coat the walls of underworld corridors
and cannot be touched without giving off deadly spores. Avoid them when
you can.

Right, although I never heard of any costing hundreds of Kaitars per gram
for food! Hallucinogenic fungi probably are sold for high prices, of
course.

If you want to see pure viscera-twisting ugliness, get one of the
experienced fungus-harvesters of Penom to bring up one of the fungi called
the Dark King's Crown. The smell and sight cause even hardened warriors to
lose their lunch.

Ugh... I happen to love mushrooms, but I wouldn't fool with Tekumelani
fungi unless I had a convenient food-taster.

	I agree on this.  It's only been the mismanagement of the 
previous companies in getting the goods to the public.  Every company 
after TSR has mishandled Tekumel, treating it as if it were some kinky 
sex thing, to be treated as quietly and under-the-table as possible.
	That is, until TOME stepped into the picture.  Here, I know they 
lack the funds for advertising, but I wish they'd go ahead and sink the 
money into promoting a product they've worked so hard to produce....

	In a time where all role-playing is suffering at the hands of 
card games, this is not really a valid point.  Each RPG has to have its 
own gimmick to sell it, otherwise, people are going to say, "What!?  
ANOTHER RPG?  *YAWN!*"
	 Just like rock groups have to keep coming up with newer and 
weirder/stupider acts to attract fans, so do RPG's have to have their own 
uniqueness to compete with the card game craze.

	Middle Earth is presented in a completely different style; after 
all, it was never intended by its author to become a role-playing game.  
Tekumel may not have started out that way too, but eventually became such.  
Hence the need for the details and "lived-in" feeling that makes Tekumel 
such a fun place to hang out for a few hours a week.  You're essentially 
comparing apples and oranges.

	I agree whole-heartedly with your assessment here, but obviously 
your main complaint is with D&D (or its derivatives).  Tolkien's books 
may have acted as inspiration for the first of the RPG's, but it was only 
that and no more.  It wasn't until much later that somebody thought up 
the idea of actually role-playing in Middle Earth.  The Rolemaster system 
is as cumbersome as the earlier incarnations of Tekumel's rules have 
been, and probably also contributed to their lack of wide appeal.


> Barker's is the most complete

	I agree.  The only one that probably comes close are the ones put 
out by TSR and of course, MERPS.

	I'm fearful of that, too.  The solo adventures work okay for 
someone with time to burn, but most of us don't have the spare time to go 
through every story-thread in every adventure in the solo books (at 
least, I haven't had the time).  And it's obviously NOT a complete 
system, so it would've discouraged me from continuing to support it, if I 
didn't already love Tekumel.

	Sounds good.  Once TOME has given up on Tekumel (look at the 
track record so far, and tell me I'm being pessimistic), maybe you can 
act on this idea.  It sounds like it would actually work, given enough 
starting captial.

	Rather garish was my first impression, but after awhile, it did

	See my earlier comments on how long TOME will put up with their 
marketing people's rather poor handling of Tekumel.....

	Right!  The vision of Tekumel must be sold; otherwise, nobody 
will see a need to buy "yet another fantasy RPG."
	I understand Professor Barker wants to have a system unique to 
his vision of Tekumel, but considering the amount of work some people 
have done to adapt it to other PROVEN systems currently on the market, 
I'm surprised he didn't try to work out some sort of deal with one of 
them.  The larger companies probably would've handled the marketing much 
better, and sales would've been much better.
	Availability of Tekumel products over the years has been 
problematic at best, and I'm very grateful to the folks at TOME for 
putting so much effort into it.  I understand their financial situation 
limits their promotional activities, but I still feel distress at knowing 
that this present successful reemergence of Tekumel will be short-lived.
	At the same time, I hope I'm completely wrong about that last 
point.  I wish, for the people at TOME, for Professor Barker, and for 
those of us who've carried the torch all these years, that this is the 
Renaissance of things Tekumel.

I'll repeat here part of what I rold one critic who wrote to me directly:

Neither I nor my colleague, Neil Cauley, ever expected such a flap over
"no character generator" in the new rules. I am sure TOME felt the same.
The reason was that there already IS a chaacter generation book out --
vol. 1 of the "Adventures on Tekumel" series -- and this has been out for
almost two years before the new rules set was released. It seemed clear to
us that EVERYBODY would recognise that this book would be clearly
recognised as THE character generation book. There would be no need for
another character generation book to accompany the rules -- nor even for a
quick rehash of the prior book. To please total newcomers, however, we
thought that character "archetypes" (a la Shadowrun) would be a good idea.
These contain stats, background, and pictures so that new players can get
a feel for the world without all the work of rolling up characters that
have no cultural context or personal background.

To be clear, Neil and I felt that the game should be seen as a unit in its
ENTIRETY and not just as a single stand-alone item by itself. This new
boxed set contains over 180 pages of RULES: the magic system, movement,
combat, stuff for referees, etc. These are the RULES. The character
generation system is the first book of "Adventures on Tekumel" (which also
contains background material). The creatures and alien races are covered
by the Bestiary. The second, third, and fourth volumes of the "Adventures
on Tekumel" series contain more cultural background: how the temples work,
the clans, the Tsolyani army, how to shop, what various foreign lands look
like, etc. I thought it would be clear that these items are all PART of a
single GREATER gaming unit: a mega-game, if you will. All in one box, they
would have been too hideously expensive for anybody but the richest and
most committed. As separate units, they can be purchased over a period of
time -- or not at all. The character generation book is not necessary to
those willing to explore the archetypes. The Bestiary can be ignored if
one already has the old EPT rules (although the materials in there are, in
my opinion, very sketchy).The other volumes of the Solitaire Adventures
set can be used to build characters with experience, possessions, and
talents -- or they can be ignored, and purely "gamed" experienece can be
substituted. Whatever people want...

I am really surprised that the structure just described has not been clear
>from  the beginning: a central set of rules, surrounded by a number of
booklets and game-aids. This has been an industry standard for many, many
years: a central "game-book," with handooks on the gods, various special
"castles" or locales, etc. These satellites are not in themselves
expensive by today's standards. It costs over $500 to equip oneself with
all that is needed to play some of the other major games on the market --
they just don't say so. All of the Tekumel satellites can be had for about
$100, and the new rules for $45 -- with some discounts from TOME if
purchased together. Compared with other games, I don't see this as a
"rip-off." The wole set of Tekumel materials can be had for comparatively
little, considering inflation. And while few would stand still for a boxed
set including ALL of these booklets (at a price of $175???), many will be
able to buy first one piece and then another, and will eventually own the
whole set.

I wish we could have included the creature dscriptions, the world
descriptions, the history, etc. etc. in this latest work, but this would
have increased the cost of the boxed set by three or four times! The
creatures were only sketched in the most rudimentary way in "Empire of the
Petal Throne." The same was true of the history of Tekumel. I have been
trying to persudade TOME to reissue the 3 volumes of the old Sourcebook --
they have 2 in stock, but they never published the third. I suspect now,
with all the poor reviews of this game, that they never will.

If buyers are not satisfied, they should call TOME at 610-935-7622 and get
their money back. If the character generation book is not on sale in a
particular game store, I can only urge that new players use the character
archetypes until they can order one from TOME, or just build a campaign
around the rather interesting people of the Archtypes themselves. If this
works for "Shadowrun," why not for Tekumel?

I don't consider the new game "incomplete." It is part of a large
constellation of rules and game-aids. I thought this would be crystal
clear from the way the previous solitaire adventures, bestiary, and
character generation book appeared. 

TOME is a small company, without the artists, editors, co-writers, or
capital to produce major games. They operate on the proverbial shoestring.
I personally enjoyed the covers and the archetypes artwork. The map is, in
my opinion, very handsome. I have seen a lot worse among the big games
currently stocked in our local gaming store. 

I have no idea why the dice. That wasn't my idea.

All of the "satellite" books are available from TOME: Ebon Bindings, the
Character Generation booklet, the Bestiary, the other 3 volumes of the
solo adventures (which are really pretty much "background materials" in
disguise). I think many will be willing to try out the Archetypes. Others
will ask their store to obtain the character generation book -- and a few,
yes, a few will return the game for their money back. So be it.

It was all I could do to get Tekumel out again in SOME form before the
public before I die (I am now retired and ill with a variety of problems).
I am saddened by all of these negative comments, but I still think we did
the right thing. If I had had lots of money and lots of support
(co-writers, several artists, etc.), as do some other major games, I might
have done differently. But this is all I can manage. I can only hope that
players will be patient and interested enough to obtain the new rules and
also some of the other pieces to the set. I think Tekumel will reward
them. It's an interesting and different world.

This will be my last word on this topic. I have said my piece. Please
don't bother e-mailing me about this. If you don't enjoy the new rules
(plus or minus the other satellites), please return them to TOME. I hope
more of you will use them for what they were meant for and enjoy.

Agreed in full that money is the problem, and part of the reason why it
is a problem is because far too many people in the gaming world demand
extremely high production values.

We've been arguing this one on my own gaming mail list for some time, in
regards to my own game world & system. People either wanted extemely
high production values or they wanted everything for free. No one was
willing to accept various offered middle of the road approaches (Like
desktop published copies or electronic copies) if there was money
involved. The gaming public has become jaded by the 'frills' of
production, wanting full color art, fancy bindings (or hard back books),
etc.

I though the production values on the Different Worlds versions of
Tekumel were fine, doable within the capabilities of modern desktop
publishing (though maybe with spiral bindings instead of the staples)
and viable. It seems in this market I'm in a minority.

Quality of writing, material and content seems to be secondary to many
gamers these days. They'll put up with abysmal and flawed mechanics and
world concepts (Like the 'World of Darkness') for flashy production.

The market is no longer one of hobbyists, and that makes those of us
who are in an uncomfortable minority.

Understandable from your post in regards to the points you brought up...

    Why are they sticking dice in the set? Obviously its not designed
    for a 'beginners' set. Dice included is a waste of money on
    production that could be used elsewhere.

    Again, semi-useless. Shrinkwrap is cheaper.

    A survivable omission, IF they keep the Bestiary in print.

 Agreed totally. Since the adventures book is not to be found, it means
 the game is not playable by new folks.

Sounds much like much of the Different Worlds editions, in regards to
binding etc.

[[Excess omitted that I wasn't commenting on]]

Basically you have 3 booklets with a grand total of about 200 pages
of material, including artwork and with no indexing.

The map sounds nice, but it seems by the description they put a lot of
the production money into it, which may be part of the problem. Some of
us wouldn't care if it was simply a black and white map, so long as it
was readable.

 And again, too much in the way of 'production draw'...usually done to
 make up for a lack of content when you are dealing with a 'box'. I know
 lots of folks that avoid sealed boxes when buying RPG material because
 it is usually to hide a lack of content.

 Agreed on your analysis, I'm sorry to say.

 At $44 a copy the system is overpriced in regards to content. White
 Wolf produced Vampire in Hardback (no map or silly dice) for a retail
 cover of $25, containing 275 pages, for example. I see no reason why
 Tekumel could not have been done in a similar style and cost factor.

 If cheaper production values were used (which it appears was done
 with Tekumel this time in regards to the books) and the silly frills
 (Dice, complex map) were disposed of, the product should be possible
 at much lower costs. I know this from my own exploration into this
 for my own game (Fantasy Realms : World of T'Phon). Tome must have
 paid far too much for its artists, or wanted too large a profit margin,
 or had distributors and retailers that wanted too big a profit margin.

What do those of you who know both think of Columbia's "Encyclopedia
Harnica" as a model of FRP world-publishing that Tekumel publishers
might want to emulate?

For those who don't know: Columbia Games publishes a game,
"Harnmaster"; aside from a few items which are primarily rules (core
rules, rules for naval/seafaring topics, and more detailed magic
rules) most of the materials are descriptions of a particular region
of the fantasy world of Kethira, an archipelago dominated by the
island of Harn (similar in technical and social development to 
England under the Normans). 

The bulk of the descriptive materials are the "kingdom modules" (one
of which is actually a "republic module"), each containing several
articles pertaining to topics related to the kingdom in question.  The
modules are designed to be cut apart, hole-punched, and alphabetized
into binders.  Typically, a module has a longer article on the kingdom
itself (its history, feudal structure, descriptions of its major
personalities and subregions, and some numerical data on those
regions), articles on two or three of the major communities, one on a
ruin or other mysterious site, very short articles (two-page) on the
nomadic human peoples (two or three) near the kingdom, and one or two
articles on another topic related to the region (things like the Guild
of Arcane Lore, the gladiatorial Pamesani Games, the island's systems
of law, common medicinal herbs, Harnic heraldry, Harnic astrology,
details on the elves and dwarves (described in their kingdom modules),
etc.).

Other materials include "Gods of Harn", with articles describing
"religion on Harn" and the major deities, "Cities of Harn" and "Son of
Cities", describing the seven major towns of the island and some major
buildings in them, "Castles of Harn" and "Castles of Orbaal" (Orbaal
is one of the kingdoms), and the overall "Harnworld" module which
describes the island's overall history, the continent it's near
(Lythia), its world (Kethira), and a very general article on the
world's languages. Products on the scale of "Harnworld" have also been
done on the Viking-ish region of Ivinia and the more traditionally
feudal Shorkyne/Chelemby/Harbaal region. There's also a "HarnPlayer"
product, containing general background material oriented toward
players and a bunch of commonly-known stories and legends of the
island.

I think this could be a viable model for developing Tekumel - in fact,
things have sort of been going along these lines with the S&G1
sourcebook, the bestiary, and the religion book (still in the
future). Tsolyanu is already divided along provincial lines, and S&G1
has one-liner descriptions of "interesting stuff" in each region of
the country. Perhaps the provinces could be grouped into larger chunks
and Encyclopedia Harnica-style modules written for them, with another
describing the nation's history in general. This way, gamers could get
information on the regions their campaigns are set in, and gradually
acquire more pieces depending on how interested they are in the "big
picture". If this works, one could go on to develop the other four
Empires and the minor states to various degrees.

I think it's important that things be clustered by the publisher on a
basis of game usefulness rather than some more artificial scheme
("Scrolls of Knowledge A-C", "Scrolls of Knowledge D-F", etc.). 

TOME can take comfort in the fact that they can't possibly fail to
adhere to schedules as badly as Columbia - Harn fans are still waiting
for the Trierzon and Azeryan regional modules, first slated to come
out in 1986!

I must disagree with Joseph. White Wolf games sell in such large quantities
that they can afford print runs which will allow for high production
costs.

I must say that dice are a silly addition, especially in Europe where
dice makes it a game subject to sales tax, whereas without dice it is a 
book and not subject to it. 17.5% in the UK is a lot of tax for
some dice.

Could someone tell TOME to take the dice out of the UK destined boxes?

I am still awaiting the new rules, but I read the long review posted
with interest. I am quite pleased the Adventures In Tekumel Vol 1 is
not wasted, I always feared an alternative character gen system for
the new rules.

Templates a la Star Wars / Shadowrun sound very good, and indeed any shop 
willing to stock the new rules will be able to get the character gen.

I really am surprised that people expected huge budget production 
values. Tekumel just isn;t like that, half of it's charm is the fact
that there are acres of dusty tomes in close type that you have to study
hard.

I am very much looking forward to a game system that I can play, with good
magic rules. The S&G magic was never available and yet that is what other
fans have raved about.

I agree that Chaosium would have done a slicker job, but even they would
have had to charge a lot, cut out a lot of the interesting stuff, and
maybe had to think very hard about whether to bother.

Thank you TOME, Thank you Prof Barker, I love your world with all its
imperfections, and I hope that the criticism will not hurt you too much.
People on the 'net can be very critical, more so than if they were face to
face.

Can I hpe that you might honour us with having more Tekumel material
donated to your fans? I guess much of it is typewritten stuff, perhaps
Bob Dushay could ask your permission to scan it, even convert it to
wordprocessor files?

I'll say "the collector must be very careful", Prof. Barker himself
mentions fungi as a hazard of the underworld in at least one place that
I recall (_The Man of Gold_), and one of the nastier denizens of the
underworld is a form of animate fungi (the Sagun): caveat Mycophage! ;-)

Interesting speculation though, as fungi have played such important 
roles in the diets and religions of Earth, why not Tekumel?  Though, the 
comparative prevalence of edible vs. nasty fungi might mitigate against 
them being widely used.

Hey everybody.  Just play the game.  If you don't like some of the rules, 
fiddle with 'em.  It's a grand tradition in the gaming hobby to tinker 
with game mechanics.  If you don't want to pay that much for a set of 
rules you're probably going to change, don't buy it - get the source 
material and use a different system.  But for gods' sake, if you're into 
Tekumel, SUPPORT IT!  I can't believe all the bitching I'm reading in 
here.  We should all be thanking our lucky stars that there's anything 
new coming out at all!  If you want that to keep happening, *complaining* 
won't do it, and suggesting other ways the game *could have* been 
packaged won't do it.  The only thing that'll keep Tekumel stuff coming 
out is if there continues to be enough interest in it.  So play the 
game, introduce as many friends as possible to Tekumel, and help nurture a 
feeling of excitement about Prof. Barker's world.  If you can't do that, 
Tekumel's *already* dead.  Right?

You know what I'd like to see?  Some war stories from ongoing campaigns.  
Neato ideas for artifacts and wierd new monsters and stuff.  Things that 
remind us all that we're actually interested in playing games set in 
Tekumel instead of bitching about production values and so on. And I'll 
tell you something else - when they finally deliver my boxed set, I 
intend to love it to death, whether it's incomplete or unattractive or 
overpriced or whatever.  It's TEKUMEL, dammit!

	For the past two days I have been following the bitching about 
the new edition of the rules.  I have one thing to ask all of you:
When you go to McDonalds and order an extra value meal do you bitch
that you didn't get prime rib?  This is what you are doing over the new
rules!  Face reality.  These rules are for NEW players.  How many copies
would have been sold if these were for "Expericed Tekumel Players Only"?
The only way that Tekumel will survive as a game is if NEW players are
brought into the fold.  Haveing Arctype templates and not chariter creation
rules is to make it easyer for newbies to get into the system.  Having a
box over a bag makes people want to look at it.  Having dice in the box
means "everthing needed to play included".  Yes it would be nice to have
more background books.  But the only way TOME will be able to afford to
produce these is if there is high enough demand for it.  Adding new players
into the fold increases the demand for the advance stuff.

	As for the argument over Tekumel needing a magazine.  There are
indepentet magazines.  Write Tekamel articals for them.  Subment your
favoret adventures to them.  Subment your Tekumel art to them. (That's
for you Jeff Dee.  I know you can draw).  Bring Tekumel to people who
may never hear of it anyother way.  A good adventure in a magazine is 
better advertising than any slick ad.  We all think that the world of Tekumal
is uneaqualed ion role playing,  Let the most fasinating world sell itself
by bring it to players who are unaware of it.  This is what needs to be done
for Tekumel products to be produced.

	Just my 2 cents worth.  I turn the soapbox over to the next clown

Harn was a cute and ambitious way to publish. I would like to
see a fan publication which did the same thing, so that a regular
flow of source material came out from the Prof, but without

Economies of scale.  White Wolf has MUCH larger economies of scale than
TOME, probably by an order of magnitude or more.

For example, my company publishes books on GO, which is still fairly
obscure in the West (although it is the HOTTEST sport in Asia).
Print runs are in the low to mid thousands, and the end price to our
retail customers for a paperback book is $14.95.  Yet chess publishers
can sell much thicker books for half that price.  Another example.
I have to print 5,000 copies of a color flyer for our GO software.
The first 5,000 copies are $475, the next 5,000 are only $200 more.
The next 10,000 copies would ALSO be only $200 more.

I haven't seen the new map, but I remember the absolute THRILL of pulling
the original vinyl map out of the very first EPT box back in the 70's.
I STILL remember how it smelled.

Given the materials that TOME already has, it should consider shrinkwrapping
the map and the first volume of the Solo Adventures together, and see if
they can't use THAT to market the game better.

>  or had distributors and retailers that wanted too big a profit margin.

Distributors and retails REQUIRE a reasonable profit margin.  Wargames
West would like to buy my GO books at 55-60% off retail, and won't buy
at 50%.  Game stores buy my books at 40-45% off, but would prefer 50%.
Why would a store accept lower margins for one product when it can
instead spend its dollars on products with 50% margins?

If TOME has similar requirements to Ishi Press, then they're selling
it for 40% of retail to distribution, or $17.60.  TOME's margin can't
be any worse than 40% (otherwise it's not worth doing business) so
it cannot cost them more than $11 to produce, including overhead and
royalties.  And that's assuming that it moves in anything like reasonable
or expected quantities.  Which, at this point, I doubt.

When EPT first came out (from TSR, for The Strategic Review)
there were some great maps on oil cloth or plastic backed
cloth.  Has there been a consideration of doing a reprint 
of those?  the art work of the new maps is great, but they
may not have the durability of those old maps.  This may
have actually been done in the couple of decades I have been 
away.  In any case, is anyone selling the old maps or newer
reprints of them?  Or was there another set of maps done on
durable backing that are the current vogue?

The Swords and Glory maps were of similar material, and with
better artwork (and more land area by more than double) than
the original EPT maps.  

The last I had heard, Gamescience still had some copies of
the original S&G Sourcebook available (without box) with
these maps.  They were $33 (I think that includes)
postage).


The thing to do with the current map is to 
take it to a map store and have it laminated.  I'm going to 
go next week.

You state the game is "for NEW players", and that the inclusion of
dice makes "everything needed to play included". However, I would say
a character generation system is considered "needed to play" by most
serious RPG players (i.e. people who have played other games and now
want to try Tekumel), and it's damned tough to play a game set on
Tekumel when the spiffy "everything needed to play" game one just
bought has nothing in it on the world one is supposed to be playing
in.

You ask how many copies would be sold if the rules were for the
experienced Tekumel player only - yet Professor Barker has effectively
stated that he expects everyone who picks these up to either have all
the solo adventures, or to acquire them in short order.

Yes, _Star Wars: the RPG_, _TORG_, and _Shadowrun_, among others, use
the "template"/"archetype" concept. However, they also have rules for
creating totally new characters from ground zero. Said games have a
growth path from novice to experienced player that can be experienced
with the basic rules alone (I say this with some reservation, as both
_TORG_ and _Shadowrun_ didn't include fully fleshed-out magic systems,
including spell design rules, in their basic rules). If one is aiming
for broad appeal, this seems to me a better strategy than one which
produces a product containing materials useful primarily for novices
(and even then questionably so, from what I've heard) and which says
to the more experienced player, "to play this game at your level, you
have to buy more stuff".

I will probably buy _Gardasiyal_ to support TOME, Prof. Barker, and
Tekumel, and to satisfy my own completionist tendencies. However, from
what I hear, I very much doubt it will be the "breakout product" that
Tekumel boosters seem to have been hoping for. I also think TOME is
being deceptive if they don't emphasize on the box cover (which I
assume will be shrink-wrapped to disallow possible purchaser
inspection of its contents) that it contains rules only, minus a
character generation system, and has no world background.

Also, when gamers buy a rules set priced well above the average price
of an RPG basic rules set these days, they are justified in expecting
not necessarily "prime rib" but definitely something more than an
"extra value meal"; I don't believe _Gardasiyal_ is being pushed as
such, either.

(As an aside, I hope I'm not the only one who thought the bad puns in
the solo adventures got really old, really fast, and who hopes they
have been toned way way down in _Gardasiyal_.)

	Bill,
	Thanks for your review of Gardasiyal.  I've only just started 
reading over the rules, but I was also disappointed with the same items 
you've mentioned.  The fact that you have to get the Adventures Book #1 
even to generate characters is infuriating!  I already have the book, but 
folks new to Tekumel obviously won't.  My set came with an order form so 
you could buy that book directly from TOME, but how many new folks will 
feel that this should've been included in their $45 purchase already?
	The rules do seem to be a very trimmed-down version of S&G, and 
perhaps that's a good thing.  I remember those rules being extremely 
over-cumbersome and many of the rules unnecessary.  Having a quick-play 
set of combat rules is actually good for folks who don't care about which 
knuckle on your right pinky finger got bruised in that last combat round.
	As I mentioned in an earlier post, I felt that the past track 
record of Tekumel with small game companies was a good indication how 
this go at writing a "definitive" set of rules would turn out.  If TSR 
(probably the biggest of the gaming companies) did such a mediocre job 
with 2nd Ed. AD&D, we shouldn't be surprised when a much smaller company 
doesn't meet our expectations.
	I am very thankful to TOME for making every effort to reawaken 
interest in the world of Tekumel.  I just wish the effort had produced a 
product that would be cutting-edge for 1995.  Instead, we have a rules 
set that is somewhat patchwork and incomplete, which will not appeal to 
the vital new blood needed to make it profitable.
	As Bill said, *Very Heavy Sigh!*

				Sincerely,

				Rick Kurgas

	I will be at Gen-Con, and will be looking forward to seeing any 
sort of presentation of the world of Tekumel.  I remember the early years 
of Gen-Con, when there would be a full-scale battle set up, and you could 
come along and help push pieces around for as long as you wished.
	Normally, the battle revolved around taking a small fortress on a 
Sakbe road, with only a few hundred units on each side.  It was still 
loads of fun to watch or participate; the road and fortress were finely 
detailed, and the minis were exquisitely painted!
	At a local gaming convention here in St. Louis a bunch of years 
ago, we had the Tekumel Games folks attending.  They brought a complete 
model of a temple dedicated to Vimuhla!  It could be taken apart to show 
various portions of the interior, including some of the dungeons.
	If any of you are attending Gen-Con, let me know so I can look 
you up.  I'm trying to generate new interest here in playing in the world 
of Tekumel, but swapping ideas and stories is always helpful.

				Rick Kurgas

	I'm sorry to include the entire letter sent by David Stone, but 
is this allowable on the Tekumel netnews?  I don't mind companies 
advertising Tekumel products, but as you can see from the above, this 
guy's company seems to be aiming at a different crowd than resides here.
	As a response of sorts, I would rather buy my Tekumel products 
directly from TOME, or from a local game store, than give business to a 
company which resides on the 'Net, as I have no proof that this 
particular company isn't just a scam.  Getting an 800-number isn't that 
hard; and claiming you're a company with the unoriginal name of "David 
Stone & Associates", makes me uncomfortable at best.
	My recommendation is for all of us to buy directly from TOME, or 
if possible, support your local game store by buying from them.  There 
are too many prying eyes and con-games on the 'Net to make it safe enough 
to shop using the 'Net.  Only the larger usernet companies, like AOL, 
Prodigy, GEnie and so on screen advertisements, and then not too 
consistently.
	Save your money for those who truly deserve your patronage.

The maps are a bit of an issue.  I've not seen the new ones yet, but 
personally I think we should be grateful that there now are some.

I know the original EPT came with two maps in colour - one of Jakalla, and 
one of Tsolyanu.  The Gamescience reprint came with these as well. I have 
one, so I can testify that the maps were the only good quality bit of the 
Gamescience reprint.  I expect they may have been the same ones as the 
original - in any event they were printed in full colour on tough plastic.

Gamescience also issued the Tekumel World Book (aka Swords and Glory Vol I) 
in a boxed set with 4 maps of Tekumel, covering a lot more ground.  These 
maps too were of excellent quality, unlike the hideous typesetting and 
binding (only those who have one know how awful these were - buy the DW 
reprints where possible).

The Different Worlds reprint of EPT did not come with any maps - only a 
photocopy onto brown card (?) of the Jakalla map, bound as an insert.  Nor 
did their reprint of 2 parts (of 3) of the world book.  I think these 3 
books are still available.

So I can say you've chosen an excellent moment to return to EPT.  For the 
first time in years there is a load of good quality material available; even 
some colour maps!

Check out the archives of the tekumel newsletter for details on what has 
been published, and by whom, since you last played.

The review is gone from here -- can someone e-mail it to me?

I'm interested in what other people think.  I'm a little 
disapointed - on casual glance it looks like a translation
of S&G #2, and it doesn't have character generation rules.
(Its got character generation rules outline on the first

The DWP reprint of S&GI part 1 has what I believe are reprints of the
four maps within the text itself, albeit at reduced scale and in
black-and-white. For this I am thankful, as the copy of the
Gamescience S&GI I got at a con had no maps in it. 

At this point I am kicking myself that I didn't buy more of the old
Tekumel stuff that DWP was selling at Origins 89, the only one I ever
managed to get to. I did get a copy of "The Tsolyani Language", which
I am pleased as punch with.

Allowable?  Well, unfortunately there's no way to stop them, Rick.

What I ALWAYS do with these ads is to post a reply-mail, including the

I've seen some ads that work.  Inevitably they are VERY brief (two, three

no exclamation points.  Something like

Something like that, posted carefully only to pertinent newsgroups, gets

their nonsequitur all-caps rantings.

P.S. to those confused, no, TOME doesn't have a web page or presence, that

Okay, here's my take, briefly, on the whole TOME-boxed-set issue:

"You can't please everyone, so you've got to please yourself."
"Something is better than nothing."
"Caveat emptor."
"I never buy version .0 of anything."

First, everyone who is interested enough to buy the boxed set IN ADVANCE
has had two or more years to examine the solo adventure books, even if only
by looking at them in the bookstore.  These clearly state that they are
the preliminary rule-set for the more advanced rules, including character
generation and rules for low-level characters.

Barring this, TOME's telephone number is readily available, as is their
address.  Prior to purchasing the product, one could have asked here on
the newsgroup or directly of TOME what the boxed set contained.  If one
insists on being the first-on-the-block to see the new rules, one must
be willing to accept what one gets.  If you were unwilling to accept
what you got, why didn't you wait for someone else to review the product
for you, and decide based on more information?

IN ANY EVENT...  this set of publications is the first new release of
Tekumel in many years.  Whether or not it is perfect, whether or not
it's done the way this self-appointed expert or that one believes is
proper, it is a GOOD THING.  Why?

Because it makes Tekumel a modern product.  Rather than being "that old
game from the Seventies" it is now something which is currently in-print
and on the market.

Why is this good?  Because as many people have pointed out, it would be
lovely if someone with more money than TOME were to invest more in 
Tekumel and "do it right".  Or at least "do it bigger."  With Tekumel 
currently in-print, it's much more likely that a bigger game company 
might look at it as an existing product which they could purchase the
rights to and publish.  Is that likely to actually happen?  Maybe not.
But it's a lot more likely than it was before TOME took up the challenge
of producing something as big as Tekumel.

Personally, I'd love to see some huge company come along and offer both
TOME and Barker sufficient compensation to transfer the rights to Tekumel.
Done right, Tekumel could be a uniquely successful product for a company
with foresight and good marketing.

Finally, bickering over the rules is silly.  Tekumel is not about rules.
This will make many self-appointed experts purse their lips and shake
their heads, but it's the truth.  Tekumel is about the culture.  If you
buy Tekumel game books to find out exactly how many "hits" a chlen-hide
shield has, or exactly how far a '16' roll allows you to jump, you're
playing the wrong game.  Tekumel products should best be used as a 
reference to the culture, a window into this weird, amazing world.  What
does a Mnor LOOK like, not how many hit points does it have.  What
takes place during the Festival of Light in Usenanu, not how many Qirgal
it costs for a paper boat with a candle in it.  As has been stated over
and over again, Phil's group doesn't even USE the rules -- any rules.
Sometimes we'll look up a detail or that, but without rulebooks we'd
manage to figure it out for ourselves.  But where we need BOOKS is when
we're trying to figure out the significance of a particular ritual celebration
to the residents of a city, how we ought to properly approach a powerful 
individual for their support doing something which might be treasonous but
which is motivated by allegance to the Petal Throne, if not the Emperor.
It's in the workings of the culture that the real questions exist.

And, frankly, as a cultural reference, the solo books are unequaled.
They are the Professor's own examples of how the people of Tekumel interact
under conditions both extreme (as in the novels) and mundane.  THAT is what
one needs for Tekumel.

So the rules-lawyers and RPG experts can complain all they like about this-
or-that characteristic of the game and how it is constructed or marketed.
There is no pleasing all such people, and any change made in one direction
would irritate adherents of other gaming techniques and philosophies.
And, sure, we'd all like to see so much money invested in Tekumel publications
that each page was glossy paper and featured photographs of beautiful people
in various states of undress with rules written by Paid Experts, delivered
to your home on a palanquin borne by nude slaves and opened to a fanfare of
a-cappella singers and a release of doves.

Meanwhile, the rest of us should focus on what we do have.  First, NEW STUFF.
Second, MORE INFORMATION THAN WE HAD BEFORE, and third the OPPORTUNITY to
see Tekumel furthered.

If you happen to know someone with connections to powerful game-publishing
companies, show them the TOME stuff.  Maybe a big company will buy Tekumel
and "do it right", even to hiring the 'experts' on here as advisors for 
huge salaries.  Maybe Spielberg will make a movie out of Tekumel under his
new studio system and I'll get to play a slave.  But until then, PLAY THE
GAME.  Enjoy!  That's what it's really about.


P.S. Personally, I think the new maps make the whole thing worth it.

P.P.S. If it makes the game more attractive to you, be aware that
several of the models for the archetype illustrations are real women
who you could meet someday if you're lucky.  Woo hoo!

But the problem is that the rules are for ONLY experienced gamers. That is my
complaint. The new rule set is NOT for newbies, but rather only for those
of use who have all the other published Tekumel products.

I don't disagree, but adding another 20-40 pages to the product (i.e. 240
pages instead of 200) would not have been an excessive cost. A lot of
players I know (and I am talking Tekumel neophytes) like creating their
own characters. Archtypes are great for examples to show what a completed
character is like.

I agree, but I argue that the new rules will bring NO players into Tekumel
that weren't interested before and that is my complaint with the rules as
I stated above. The rules work fine for me, and for the majority of the
people on this list. However, If I knew nothing about Tekumel, saw the new
boxed rules, bought them for $44, and then discovered that I need to spend
$30 more to get character creation and creature descriptions (not to
mention another $24 for background of the world, I'd be royally pissed.
I'm not pissed off, since I have these materials already, but it forbodes
very poorly for getting new blood into Tekumel.

Professor Barker,

I'd like to personally thank you for your gift in bestowing Tekumel upon
the gaming community. I find the history fascinating and devoured the only
two novels I ever found (_The Man of Gold_ and _Flamesong_). I am saddened
to hear of your ill health and wish you all the best. I wish we could have
met.


To the rest of you,

I have not gamed in almost ten years now, but still follow the
discussions.I have to say a few words about the industry. Not that much
has changed really since I stopped. Too many people want everything handed
to them on a silver platter and even then couldn't run an interesting
campaign, then they blame the system for what are truly their own
shortcomings.

That said, there were indeed problems in the early EPT rules I had. There
were many things I didn't like about about EVERY system I picked up (at
least 10 RPG systems). So myself and one other guy wrote our own. It too
wasn't perfect, but there was nobody else to complain to, and most folks
who played it thought it worked pretty well. Moral of the story: If you
don't like something about a system, CHANGE IT. It is after all, your
world.

Greetings Oh Most Noble and Munificent Bearers of Knowledge and
Entertainment by the Way of Professor Barker and his Most Wondrous
Imagination!

I seek a favor.  And I do so in the most humble and abject way I know
how.  Please forgive my lack of knowledge about Tekumel.  I have not
actually played since 1976.  And I would like help in getting a
beginning campaign started.  A recommendation towards any recently
published material that's still in print would also be greatly
appreciated.
  
Do any of you have adventure material that you created and would be
willing to share with me?  There are probably many other sort-of-new
and sort-of-retread Tekumel players out here internetting around.

[start "sad story" violin music]

I have been and am continuing to acquire as much background material as
possible in the realm of available in-print commercially printed
material.  My funds (and my non-gaming wife's patience) are not without
limits, however.  I am stuck in-between rulesets (well, for a month,
anyway).  And there are apparently no Tekumel suppliers in the
Dallas-Ft. Worth Metroplex.

[stop violin music]

Anyway, I am afraid I still do not know how to correctly create player
or NPC names, clans, and so on.  I would appreciate any pointers more
experienced players might offer.  

Similarly, any old "dungeons" or other adventures your players have
conquered but you still have laying around gathering dust would make
excellent fare for a convention game (hint! hint!), especially in the
Dallas area (nudge-nudge).  Of course, I can only speak for one
would-be Texan...

I just recieved the boxed set today and while I was already expecting the
worse since reading these "reviews", I was not really all that displeased.
I think that the Archetypes serve their purpose well. 

But, I agree with Mr. Alberti, that the true need that MUST be fulfilled
is in actual source material. Now, before the large cry goes out
concerning the HUGE source published and republished, I submit that while
copious, that source book was necessarily large to encompass such a
complex, far ranging, and dynamic world. I refer more towards the
focussing on a certain section, town, or city. Detail the political
intrigues running rampant in said city, and design some interesting NPCs
to be encountered there. I could go on with more examples, but I think you
get my point.

I will support Tekumel in whatever form it appears in and frankly this new
game will give me the excuse of introducing Tekumel to new players. being
a "new" game rather than "that game from the seventies" does entice new
players. I know it doesn't make sense, but it's true.

So, my congratulations to the Professor. Long may his vision ensnare and
enthrall our imaginations.

What *really* annoys me (having just got my pre-order copy airmail - I paid
for it, so I'm entitled to bitch about it!) is the *really* poor level of
typesetting shown in Gardasiyal compared to the previous Tekumel releases by
TOME. I can (and do) better using a PC and MS Publisher or Ventura Publisher
(which seems to be what they used ... a PC and a Page Layout program) - the
ragged right layout and wide margins that waste so much space are a real
annoyance ... they could have fitted at least 10-15% *more* in (or done it
at less cost) if they had used the same layout as for the previous books
(which at least looked professional). And some of the tables have columns
of figures that don't even match up with the column headers! This is piss
poor production planning. The whole product looks like some juvie just
threw it together overnight ... surely they could have done better.

As for the fact that the boxed set is completely unusable for a person that
buys it off the shelf, well, this was completely inexcusable. It bodes ill
for the future of Tekumel products if this is the "standard" to which they
aspire. I sure as hell hope that Mitlaniyal (the God handbook) is going to
be done to the standard of the previous products.

Also, I note in an insert in Gadarsiyal that the three books inside are being
sold separately ... there's no chance, I s'pose, of the separate versions
having being printed with decent, non-self-destruct, covers? Anyone know?
As it is, I'll be having mine photocopied and ring bound as the chance of
the three books surviving extended use is, as far as I can see, zilch.

Finally, has anyone else suggested to TOME that they need to bring out some
sort of historical background/setting *update* to cover the world of
Tekumel as it is *now*. I have the original TSR rules, the DW reprints,
Gamescience's "Swords & Glory" materials ... and the little driblets of
clues dropped in the solitaire adventures are *really* intriguing, and vastly
annoying because they don't tell enough! How hard could it be to do an update?

But for ghu's sake don't do it as *another* solitaire adventure ... I find
them a complete bore and probably wouldn't buy any further ones just on
general principles!

abomination that must not happen except for materials that are harmful
to society.  The choice of which books fall into that category are left
to the Reader WITH THE EXCEPTION of any material related to Empire of
the Petal Throne and the World of Tekumel.

How about an alt.games.frp.tekumel-sponsored reprint of some of the
extremely difficult to find (in Dallas, anyway) out-of-print background
materials?  For example, we locate the copyright owners of the "NW
Frontier Gazeteer" and "Journal of Tekumel Affairs" (and any other
publication that can be found) and offer to buy inexpensively offset
printed copies printed by a printer of Professor Barker's choice
(perhaps TOME?) and pay them a royalty per copy equal to what the
copyright holder got off the original, out-of-print version.  Plus the
cost of the copy.  

These inexpensive copies would be designed not to compete with the
market for rare items except that the gaming material would be
available to the masses.  I am suggesting that all reproductions ne
made in black and white on 8.5"x11" paper with a light cardstock cover
if appropriate.  Perhaps some materials would not be appropriate to
copy and would be left out-of-print?

I have assumed a lot, but if we arrange it correctly, the majority of
Tekumel-related material could be made available under terms that would
benefit all.  Those who own the rights to the material would profits
they would not otherwise receive.  Those who want the material would
profit from materials they could not otherwise obtain.  Interest would
rise in the game as this would be "new" material to nearly all of us. 
Those with originals to sell would have a larger market of more
motivated fans ("sure, I've got that inexpensive alt.games.frp.tekumel
version, but I want the ORIGINAL, the COLOUR, the FULL-SIZE MAPS!" they
might say).

I would like to see someone do something with a cleaned up version of
the Tekumel Digest, ShadowLands BBS, and this Usenet group.  The amount
of material that has slipped through my fingers is enormous.

What do you all think?  Especially Professor Barker and other Copyright
holders?  If I am out of line, I crave your forgiveness.  If my
worthless ideas can be fashioned into something useful by a mind of
power, may I add my name to the list of interested buyers.

I agree.  That would be very nice, if someone would organise it.  Mind you, 
some of the copyright holders might be difficult to trace, for ephemeral 
journals, and others, like TSR (Legions of the Petal Throne) might want to 
gouge us.  I wonder how much effort it would be?

I've been looking at the Yan Kor script, and noticed that the single quote, 
', is given as a consonant, both here and in the Tsolyani script.  Does 
anyone know why, or how this would be used?

Summary: Use contact paper

There have been several complaints about the durability of the
_Gadarsiyal_ booklets.

Please know that they're _better_ than the RQ booklets that
Avalon Hill puts in their box sets.  Here's a trick to preserve
them very well, if you're willing to do a little arts-and-crafts.

Go to any hardware or kitchenware store.  Buy clear matte contact 
paper.  I'm talking about the plastic sheeting, sticky on one side,
that people use mainly to line shelves.  I have had excellent results
with Rubbermaid brand, "Contact brand self-adhesive plastic, 
Clear color."    It comes in rolls of 3 yards by 18 inches. 
Here in NYC, where prices are always high, one roll goes for
$3.49.  

Cut a piece larger than the cover of the booklet.  The hardest part is
laying the book onto the sticky side without getting bubbles.
I've found that if you do get some bubbles (almost inevitable), 
you can make a tiny pinhole or razor cut, and then push the air out
of the bubble.   Fold the overlap over onto the inside of the
cover.

Advanced craftsmen will remove the staples from the binding 
before applying the plastic.  They will replace them after 
the cover is done, so that the staple goes through the plastic
too.  This really helps the book stay together well, so I
should probably suggest this to be mandatory, and not just
for ambitious devotees.

My RQ books have held up for ten years of heavy use because
of this technique.  And, their original paper covers are 
cheaper and thinner than the Gadarsiyal covers.

Best,
-DC

The ' is used to represent a "glottal stop", which is a "sound" that is
not common in western european languages.  Probably the closest thing
with which you're likely to be familiar is the sound in the "Cockney"
dialect exemplified by the pronounciation of the tt in "bottle" (an
example that Prof. Barker himself has used). Thus, for instance,
Mu'ugalavya (did I spell that right?) is not pronounced like MOOgalavya,
but rather like MOO-OOgalavya.  I think a similar sound in some African 
languages is typically represented by an exclamation point.

Fellow Debtor:

This is going to sound like a con, but in fact IT WORKS!
Five dollars is a small investment in your future.  Forget the lottery
for a week, and give this a try.  It can work for ALL of us.

You can edit this list with a word processor or text editor and then
convert it to a text file.

                                  Good Luck!!

Dear Friend:

My name is Dave Rhodes.  In September 1988 my car was repossessed and the
bill collectors were hounding me like you wouldn't believe.  I was laid
off and my unemployment checks had run out.  The only escape I had from
the pressures of failure was my computer and my modem.  I longed to turn
my advocation into my vocation.

In January 1989 my family and I went on a ten day cruise to the tropics.
I bought a brand new Lincoln Town Car with CASH in February 1989.  I am
currently building a new home on the west coast of Florida, with a private
pool, boat slip, an a beautiful view of the bay from my breakfast room
table and patio.  I will never have to work again.  Today I am RICH!  I
have
earned over $400,000.00 (Four Hundred Thousand Dollars) to date and will
become a millionaire within 4 or 5 months.  Anyone can do the same.  This
money making program works perfectly every time, 100% of the time.  I have
NEVER failed to earn $50,000.00 or more whenever I wanted.  Best of all,
you never have to leave home except to go to your mailbox or post office.

In October 1988, I received a letter in the mail telling me how I could
earn $50,000.00 or more whenever I wanted.  I was naturally very skeptical
and threw the letter on the desk next to my computer.  It's funny though,
when you are desparate, backed into a corner, your mind does crazy things.
I spent a frustrating day looking through the want ads for a job with a
future.  The pickings were sparse at best.  That night I tried to unwind
by booting up my computer and calling several bulletin boards.  I read
several of the messages posted and then glanced at the letter laying next
to the computer.  All at once it became clear to me.  I now had the key to
my dreams.

I realized that with the power of the computer I could expand and enhance
this money making formula into the most unbelievable cash flow generator
that has ever been created.  I substituted the computer bulletin boards in
place of the post office and electronically did by computer what others
were doing by mail.  Now only a few letters are mailed manually.  Most of
the hard work is speedily downloaded to other bulletin boards throughout
the world.  If you believe that someday you deserve that lucky break that
you have waited for all of your life, simply follow the easy instructions
below.  Your dreams WILL come true.


                                                       Sincerely yours,

                                                       Dave Rhodes




     INSTRUCTIONS

Follow these instructions EXACTLY, and in 20 to 60 days you will have
received
well over $50,000.00 cash, all yours.  This program has remained
successful
because of the HONESTY and integrety of the participants.  Please continue
its
success by CAREFULLY ADHERING to the instructions.

Welcome to the world of Mail Order!  This little business is somewhat
different
than most mail order houses.  Your product is not solid and tangible, but
rather a service.  You are in the business of developing Mailing Lists.
Many
large corporations are happy to pay big bucks for quality lists.
(The money made from the mailing lists is secondary to the income which is
 made from people like yourself requesting that they be included in that
list.)


[1]  Immediately mail $1.00 to the first 5 names listed below, starting at
     number 1 through number 5.  SEND CASH ONLY. (Total investment: $5.00)
     Enclose a note with each letter stating: "Please add my name to your
     mailing list".  Include your name and mailing address.
     (This is a legitimate service that you are requesting and you are
paying
     $1.00 for this service.)

[2]  Remove the name that appears as number 1 on the list.  Move the other
     9 names up one position (Number 2 becomes number 1, number 3 becomes
     number 2, and so on).  Place your name, address, and zip code in the
     number 10 position.

[3]  With your name in the number 10 position, upload this ENTIRE file to
     10 (ten) different bulletin boards.  You may post it to the BBS's
     message base or to the file section.  Name it FASTCASH.TXT, and use
the
     file description comments to draw attention to this file and its
great
     potential for all of us.

[4]  Within 60 days you will receive over $50,000.00 in CASH.


Keep a copy of this file for yourself so that you can use it again and
again
whenever you need money.  As soon as you mail out these letters you are
automatically in the mail order business.  People will be sending YOU
$1.00
to be placed on your mailing list.

This list can then be rented to a broker that can be found in your local
yellow pages listings for additional income on a regular basis.  The list
will
become more valuable as it grows in size.

This is a service.  **  IT IS PERFECTLY LEGAL  **

If you have any doubts as to the legality of this service, please refer to
Title 18, Sections 1302 and 1341 of the Postal Lottery Laws.

NOTE:  Make sure that you retain EVERY name and address sent to you,
either
       on computer or hard copy, but do not discard the names and notes
that
       people send to you.  This is PROOF that you are truly providing a
       service, and should the I.R.S. or some other government agency
question
       you, you can provide them with this proof!

Remember, as each post is downloaded and the instructions carefully
followed,
five memebers will be reimbursed for their participation as a List
Developer
with $1.00 each.  Your name will move up the list geometrically so that
when
your name reaches the number 5 position you will be receiving thousands of
dollars in cash.

REMEMBER  -  THIS PROGRAM FAILS ONLY IF YOU ARE NOT HONEST  -  PLEASE!!
             PLEASE BE HONORABLE...IT DOES WORK!  THANK YOU.

The  following letter was written by a participating member in this
program.
**************************************************************************
*

To those with the COMMON sense to participate in this easy money
opportunity:

     About six months ago I received the enclosed post in letter form.  I
ignored it.  I received about five more of the same letter within the next
two week.I ignored them also.  Of course, I was tempted to follow through
and dreamed of making thousands, but I was convinced it was just another
gimmick and could not possibly work.

I was wrong!  About three weeks later I saw this same letter posted on a
local
bulletin board in Montreal.  I liked the idea of giving it a try with my
computer.  I didn't expect much because I figured, if other people were as
skeptical as I, they would not be too quick to part with $5.00.  But, I
BUY
LOTTERY TICKETS WEEKLY IN MY PROVINCE AND HAVE NOTHING TO SHOW FOR IT BUT
TICKET STUBS!  This week I decided to look at this as my weekly lottery
purchase.  I addressed the envelopes and mailed out $1.00 in each as
directed.
Two weeks went by and I didn't receive anything in the mail.  The fourth
week
rolled around and I couldn't believe what happened!  I can not say that I
received $50,000.00, but it was definitely well over $35,000.00!  For the
first
time in 10 years I got out of debt.  It was great.  Of course, it did not
take
me long to go through my earnings, so I am using this excellent money
opportunity once again.  FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS AND GET READY TO ENJOY!

Please send a copy of this letter along with the enclosed letter so
together
we can convince people who are skeptical that this really does work!


                                                       Good Luck,

                                                       Charles Kust
                                                       St Agathe, Que.


Hey....
  I'm one of the people who downloaded this awhile ago, and I've made
quite
a profit...not 50,000 dollars, but TONS more than the 5 bucks I sent in.
It
might take more than 60 days to get 50,000, but I think I can wait.

          Danny Wood

I'd guess it's a glottal stop, which is often transcribed with a single
quote ... You actually hear it all the time in English, but we tend to discard
it as a meaningful segment.  Listen to yourself say "'un 'un" like you might
if someone asked you "Have you gotten the new EPT rules yet?"  Or, think of
the cockneyfied pronunciation of "bottle", wherein the "t"s become a sound
you can articulate even if you keep your tongue still.

Or, say "aaaaaah" and then try breaking up all the "a"s like "a'a'a'a'a'a'a".
You'll probably wind up making quite a few glottal stops in the second version.

Improve your German accent by putting glottal stops at the beginning of words
that begin with vowels!  :-)

I was in contact with the good folk at TOME today and was informed that a
few box sets of Gardasiyal were shipped without a small 'Introduction to
Gardasiyal' booklet. 

If you are one of those unfortunates, it is available FREE of charge just
by writing to TOME and alerting them of the oversight.

While your at it, a few kind words of encouragement go a long way.

I am not sure.  But having played EPT since the first session in 1975
(with sabbaticals here and there) it is my understanding, ' is a consonant
as the gutteral stop in Cockney English. (Like the Great One!!! Blessings
of the Gods upon him!!! stated in his books).  Bottle for instance becomes
bot'le.  Another example of how the gutteral stop is used as a consonant
can be found among the Khoisan (Southern African languages including
Khoikhoin and the San and used by among others the Kalihari Bushman) where
it is even harsher and comes out as a series of clicking noises.  (More
like the Pe Choi, in fact).  It has a value as a consonant because it is
not a contraction, or a grammatical mark, the sound actually 'takes up
space' and has value.  Please correct me if wrong, Dr. Barker.

Oh Noble One Whose Quest is One with All!!!!

You played EPT in 1976!!!  Well another old hand is still kicking about. 
Did you play in the University group then?  Are you originally from
Minnesota?  The name does not immediately ring a bell.

As to materials, the new rules are out now.  But you need the Bestiary and
 Volume 1, 1  to generate a character.  The solitaire books are also fun
and give much background to bring someone "up to date" on Tekumel.  Try
going to a used book store and obtain Dr. Barker's two novels: if you
don't already have them.  As to old materials, unfortunately I did all my
Tekumel gaming with Dr. Barker so I have really nothing of my own.

Good luck and thanks for keeping up your interest.

Mr. Bob:  Tekunu here.

I agree with your positions completely.  This has been discussed before
with the Great One Whose Pen Caresses Paper Like a Perfumed Finger Tickles
the Mistress of the Gods (Dr. Barker).
  The gaming rules are only guidelines to conduct activities on Tekumel
and the gaming rules are not actually the activity itself.  When conflict
arise that require some sort of resolution that cannot be taken care of in
the context of the story line, then rules are required to resolve those
conflicts.  (Usually this is in the realm of combat or a simple
comparative die roll)  Dr. Barker has always said that formost (1) he is a
story teller and (2) the rules are secondary.  I remember many evenings
when I was never required to roll a die, but participated actively in the
story line, having a great time.  I have boiled role playing rules down to
about 8 pages at this time for my own use.

   I agree that more material is necessary.  I am currently working on an
Onchash Chairon module from materials collected during Tekunu
hi'Qolyelmu's epic quest on the Southern Continent for rare flowers to
present to Prince R.  It will include descriptions of about a half dozen
locations in the deep southern continent.

   Hey it seems like there some interest floating around in the ephemeral
regions of this newsgroup for somesort of Tekumel publication. I would be
willing to edit a relatively unambitious and strictly non-profit newsletter/
'zine kinda thing. Suggested contents could include scenarios,maps,updates
on current events, Tekumel crossword puzzles, whatever. What do y'all think?

Well, it STILL hasn't made it through the distribution channels to Silicon
Valley, but I tell you, I want THREE copies of the map.  One to have and
to hold, and TWO to laminate and or mount together, so I can see the whole
thing at once.

My STRONGEST recommendation is that TOME make the map also available
separately.

ALSO: Although I have the new EPT set on special order, I tried some
other game stores in the San Jose-San Francisco Bay Area, and not one
of them had the new EPT on order.  All insisted that they would NOT be
carrying it, and it would have to be a special order.  This does not
bode well, as this area is one of the most active RPG and gaming markets
in the United States.

Finally, can anyone say whether the errors from the original Swords and
Glory magic system were cleaned up?  In particular, there were MANY Generic
and Temple spells which were Psychic, but their pre-requisite spells
were Ritual (ex: #172 The Attainment of Enlightenment, Psychic, requires
#62 Sagacity, Ritual; there are many others).

Also: in re-examining character generation in Part 1 Adventures in Tekumel,
am I the only one that found buying levels in Sorcery confusing?  In section
7.1 you can buy 1 or 2 levels of Sorcery, but thereafter one seems only
able to buy spells.  Does one even really HAVE levels in Sorcery (or Priest)
or only in sub-skills, or what?

The character generation rules in Adventures in Tekumel are intimidating
and unclear enough that it is no surprise to me that many lost patience
and gave up, which is why Tekumel is on the clearance shelf at the Game
Galleries, and why Gardisyal won't appear on the shelves AT ALL there.

And could we/should we/would we require purchase of the new rules as
part of the subscription requirements?  

I mean, that way we could *prove* to Professor Barker (May his name be
cheered.  May he be greeted with gladness.  May his footstep be light
and healthful!) and TOME (may their printing presses ring with ever
*increasing* orders for Tekumel products!) that we of "CyberTek(umel)"
are indeed his true followers, and faithful converts to the service of
the Ever-Glorious Petal Throne.

All joking aside, we really need to support *our* hobby.  If an AD&D
2nd Edition Players Handbook, Monsterous Compendium, and Dungeon
Master's Guide sell for about $18-30 a piece (let's assume at least $70
for the set), and we need $75 for the new rules+Bestiary+Character
Generation book, aren't we really talking about the same thing?  And we
can get clarification on a point or two, as needed, from the Professor
or one of his players over the Internet...  Just try getting TSR to
provide that kind of support for, say World of Grayhawk...  :-)

BTW, Mssrs. Bob Alberti and Brett Slocum probably deserve a few kudos
for setting up their cool web pages... regardless of how I feel about
their theology (or they mine!).

An alternative to David's suggested use of contact paper is lamination. You
need to take the books apart and remove the covers. Take these (along with 
the new maps) to your local Kinko's or other copy shop and have them 
laminated. Trim the lamination and put the books back together. Many shops
offer a choice or rigid or soft laminate.

	As far as the new map goes:  it's beautiful, but without a 
hex-grid, it's a little trickier defining exactly where the adventurers 
might be at any one time.  The original EPT and the later Gamescience 
maps, with their lamination, allowed you to use an overhead projection 
pen to mark where the players last stopped.  I don't know if I'd want to 
do that with the new map; it looks less "sturdy" to me.
	The new map's scale of 10 Tsan to every 7 millimeters is 
interesting, but for those of us who can't do math in their heads (like 
me), it's going to be a little tricky.  "Let's see, your group has gone on a 
tube car and covered about 2,354 millimeters.  Hmmmmm.  That's, uh.....  
23 divided by 7, carry the remainder......   Where's a calculator?"  ;)
	Seriously, folks:  the new map is very nice and looks like a real 
map, unlike the ones in the past.  Unfortunately, I won't be laying the 
new map down where something can be spilled on it, and I'll always have 
to keep a ruler or some improvised gauge to determine distances.  Other 
than those two concerns, I'll treasure this map.  After all, since I've 
got the earlier maps, I can use them instead and leave the new one safely 
inside its game box.

	I agree that people new to Tekumel are going to have a rough time 
of it with just Gardasiyal.  Without even a minimal sketch of Tekumel, 
the potential new GM is going to be puzzled by these rules.  After all, 
he'll have to at least buy the Tekumel Source books (and won't he be 
angry when he realizes that he's only got two-thirds of the background 
info!), even so he can figure out what all the fuss is about this strange 
world.
	Most potential GM's have used some game system in the past, and 
will probably be miffed at not having even a quick-generation system for 
creating NPC's (the archetypes will be used up by his players).  The 
monster stats will do in the early going, and this poses no real problem, 
as far as I see.  The encounter charts limit which monsters show up 
where and when.
	So the main problem I see is a GM who's never heard of Tekumel 
will have a tough time figuring out the background from the very scanty 
information provided in Gardasiyal, will end up sinking another $24 just 
to get the campaign started!  This will discourage quite a few people who 
can get an entire campaign in one book/box, not just not just the final 
five pieces of the puzzle that is Tekumel.
	For example, Castle Falkenstein, by R. Talsorian Games, is 224 
pages long and  comes in either hardback or softback format.  Over 
one-half of it is devoted to background information, maps and so on, 
while the other portion covers the game rules.  It has a table of 
contents and an index, too, making looking something up far easier.  And 
do you know how much this complete and ready-to-go game, set in a 
fantastic faerie-filled Victorian Europe, sells for?  $32 for the 
hardback and $27 for the softback!
	Now, if I were looking for an exotic setting to run an RPG in, 
and had never before heard of Tekumel, but still wanted to check both 
out, I'd spend my copious money (this *is* hypothetical!) to buy both 
sets of rules:  Gardasiyal and Castle Falkenstein.  After about two or 
three hours' comparison, I'd sell off the Tekumel stuff and begin working 
on setting up a C.F. campaign right away!

	As I've said in earlier posts, I plan on using the new rules 
myself.  They need a little tinkering (the Experience rules, 
especially!), but overall, with all the solo books and previous 
incarnations of Tekumel rules at my disposal, I can run a game.
	My congratulations to those who don't need the crutch of a rules 
system at all to play!  I wish I had your spare time to do all the work 
that would make that possible for me to do as well.  However, since I'm 
going to have to piece together a complete rules system, it's going to be 
at least another month before I can start my campaign up again.
	Not to mention the fact that since I haven't run a Tekumel game 
in over 11 years, it's going to be darn hard to find players.  Everybody 
I know is just as busy as I am, so I'll have to go find a new group of 
gamers to play the game.  Hmmm.  Another month's delay.
	Well, okay, I'll get my campaign ready to go, come June.  ;)

	BTW, I have a question:  on page 27 of Volume One, the Wound 
Effects Table looks like it uses a D10 instead of a D20, as stated.  Am I 
right on that score?

I just received mine in the mail today.  I believe everyone who pre-ordered
and didn't get the Intro, will probably get it by mail in the next week 
or so.

I must say that this Intro goes a long way toward addressing some concerns
with the set.  Though it is only 4 pages long, it contains the proviso
about AoT, Part one and the Bestiary, plus about 3 pages of historical
intro to Tekumel, including some facts I was not aware of (the Pe Choi
gave humans the Three-Light drive). It is unfortunate that the box back
has the erroneous statement 'You now hold a complete, complex, alien
and thoroughly enjoyable world' (my quibble is with 'complete world').
But for that statement (and the lack of a statement on the box about needing the 
other books) this would be a reasonably packaged game. Not perfect min
you, but what is these days.

Anyway, I encourage everyone to try it out.  After all, this is the
only game in print that you can get all the wonderful spells for
Tekumel (always my favorite part of S&G).

Enjoy!

I have found a local store which has ordered the new rules so I'm waiting
for them to coe in.  Last Tuesday (April 17) I mailed an order for The
chareter creation, solo adventures vol. 1 and monster manual.  I sent an
out of state check to pay.  Today (April 23) They arrived!!!!  For them
to get here (Utah) from Penn.  TOME had to have mailed before my check
cleared.  That is what I call custemer service!  And they also air-expressed
it at no extra charge!!!  Needless to say I plan to buy form TOME direct from
now on.

Yes, but when someone buys a GAME, they evaluate it primarily by the RULES.
(GAME = RULES).  How many people bought Adventures in Tekumel, and were
turned off by the rules?  How many weren't turned off immediately, but
gave up buying endless solitaire games while waiting for the rules?
How many potential referees turned their attention to other games because
no rules were forthcoming, and the few examples they saw were not up to
modern standards for RPGS.

Tekumel should have been marketted as a series of WORLD BOOKS, and ignored
rules almost entirely (the only exception really being Magic).  EPT has
never been a RULE set, but a WORLD set, and should have been presented as
such.

TOME could hardly have done a worse job in marketting the materials:

1992:	Adventures in Tekumel: a complex system of character generation
	for a game that will not be available for THREE YEARS.
	The Tekumel Bestiary: a collection of statistics for creatures
	for a role playing game whose rules will not be available for
	THREE YEARS.
1992-
1995:	Various solitaire adventures designed to develop characters for
	a game system that is NOT AVAILABLE.  Those who do develop
	characters CANNOT find a referee, because the rules are NOT
	AVAILABLE, and won't be for years.

1995:	After 3 years of diminishing sales of SUPPLEMENTARY products,
	the game these materials are supposed to supplement is finally
	published.  At this point, stores no longer carry the line, and
	it must be special ordered.  To add insult to injury, TOME offers
	a 25% discount for direct orders from the manufacturer, which
	bypasses the DISTRIBUTION chain, virtually assuring that future
	editions will not be available in stores.
	
	Further, the game is incomplete, lacking character generation,
	and requires supplements no longer available on store shelves.
	
According to my local game store, TOME is soliciting orders for three
more supplements, and I will order these, but I will be surprised if
TOME actually publishes all three.

I'd guess it's a glottal stop, which is often transcribed with a single
quote ... You actually hear it all the time in English, but we tend to discard
it as a meaningful segment.  Listen to yourself say "'un 'un" like you might
if someone asked you "Have you gotten the new EPT rules yet?"  Or, think of
the cockneyfied pronunciation of "bottle", wherein the "t"s become a sound
you can articulate even if you keep your tongue still.

Or, say "aaaaaah" and then try breaking up all the "a"s like "a'a'a'a'a'a'a".
You'll probably wind up making quite a few glottal stops in the second version.

Improve your German accent by putting glottal stops at the beginning of words
that begin with vowels!  :-)

Setnaffa, an excellent source for news and adventures is the fanzine
The Eye of All-Seeing Wonder, available for $6 (cash, I believe, even
though mailing cash out of the country is illegal) from
   Steve Foster, 26 Western Lane, Balham, London  SW12 8JS  United Kingdom
 
Not just to toot my own horn, but Issue #4 (the current issue) has my
adventure "Behind Enemy Lines", complete with characters.  It uses Dave
Morris's excellent Tirikelu rules system, but I have these nine characters
converted over to Gardasiyal rules--four of them are senior (experienced)
types, and five are beginners.  Each issue had at least one adventure,
and many of them include characters.  If you need adventures, there are
plenty of hooks to get you started--many adventures are excellent beginnings
to new campaigns, and at $6 an issue, it's much cheaper than most adventures.
You'll like the rest of the magazine, too.

experience was generally positive, although the players (experienced
roleplayers all) had some complaints.  First, the good.
 
1. Combat works just fine.  It's fast, smooth, satisfactory, and playable.
William Faulkner complained that there are too many modifiers--maybe, but
with a little management, they aren't a problem.  If you follow the
examples of the character sheet in the Archetypes booklet, you have your
players list their initiative and to hit mods for each weapon on their
character sheet.  Then, all you eseentially have to keep track of is
whether they were wounded.
   I confess to also having a secret weapon for these things: I retype all
key tables into my wordprocessor, and print out a referee cheat sheet that
has all relevant modifiers on one page, along with the relevant tables.
I have one page for initiative, another for to-hit rolls, and another for
damage.  It works well for me.
 
2. The skill rolls and all the rest of the rules were fine.  They were
transparent enough so that I could focus on the action and telling the story,
and they were fast enough that I could whip them out and roll when I felt
I needed a random element.  As usual in my better Tekumel games, the focus
was on the story and the player interaction; the rules worked to support
that very well.
 
Complaints.  My players were mainly ticked off that the d100 character
generation system, and the HBS attack system meant that a player who rolled
lucky at the very beginning had an enormous, and insurmountable advantage
over the rest of the party.  It's the same sort of grousing I've heard in
AD&D where two fighters have 18/90+ strengths--it tends to devalue the rest
of the warriors.  Maybe my players were just lucky, but we did have some
huge differences in ability for ostensibly equal characters.
 
The other big stink was over spell-casting.  The sorcerers felt that at
their tender levels, they had essentially one chance to get a spell off
(35% chance for successful casting, and their psychic power was enough for
only three casts), and it took too long to recover points.  This could be
adjusted (one suggestion was that failed spells didn't cost the same as
a successful one).
 
A lesser complaint was that the skill system was confusing: they felt a
maximum of 5 skill levels in languages, while 30 for everything else made
no sense, and they had trouble comparing their skills to others.  As
referee, I had no such confusion, but the players have to be happy, too.
 
I don't think Gardasiyal is state of the art, but I'm not sure what state
of the art is.  The most popular system around is AD&D, 2nd edition, and
I wouldn't consider that state of the art, either.  Gardasiyal works, it
permits me to simulate the world well enough, and it provides the key
information we've been missing for years: monster stats congruent with
player stats, how Eyes work in relation to spell-casting, etc.  I'm heart-
broken over the way this game has been packaged and marketed (broken up
into pieces, with no clear guidance for players as to what to buy and
which units are needed for what), but there's enough to make a go of it,
and the system is far more workable than Swords and Glory was.  I hope to
continue to support these rules--even if my regular group won't use them,
I'll still try to run games at conventions using them--and I hope that Tekumel
continues as a living product.
 
Anybody else actually /playing/ these rules?

Well, I've just received my copy of this, and wondered a bit what all the 
fuss was about.  Points that struck me:

- Very nice box.  It has oodles of shelf appeal, and rather reminded me of 
the old RuneQuest supplements.  Should help it sell alright.

- I was glad to see the dice.  I think I'd have felt cheated if I bought a 
game and there were no dice in it.

- Lovely maps: easily the nicest ever produced for EPT.  For the first time 
I worked out where the legions of Eselne and Mirusiya were moving in the 
original attack on Yan Kor.  I liked the 'papyrus' borders, and the glyphs 
on them.  Anyone know what they stand for?

- I saw the reference to the Temple book, Mituminyal, appearing in 1996.  I 
devoutly hope it will.

- The 3 booklets will also be available seperately: a great idea!  Encourage 
your players to buy the players guide.

- The covers of the 3 booklets had a very RQ'ish sort of feel, and were very 
good.  These are easily the best looking EPT rules we've ever had.

- I was missing the intro booklet, so I felt vol 1 started rather suddenly. 
I think a sticker on the box saying that Growing Up in Tekumel is a 
pre-requisite should be printed.  I can see why they didn't want to repeat 
all that, but a cover sticker would have deflected much criticism.

- This is the first complete role-playing system published for tekumel since 
EPT.  It's very important for that reason: it is now *possible* to play 
Tekumel out of the box.  I understood the rules clearly enough, and was very
glad to get it.  I expect 2nd hand sales of S&G II will drop rather acutely!

- The paper is thinner than that used for the solo books, but I don't see 
there's anything wrong with it.  The typesetting is good, apart from the 
strange decision to allow ragged right, rather than justified.  I think the 
layout of the solo books was better, but this is nit-picking.  There wasn't 
anything wrong with them.

- I very much liked the pre-generated characters.  This was a very sensible 
move, and helped illustrate the whole process of character generation.

- The magic system was clearly explained, and it was new to me.  Its hould 
work well, and give a distinctive tekumelani feel to the game.

- My overall impression is that this is Swords & Glory 2nd Edition, cut 
down,
better laid out, and easier to follow.  This even extends to a snippet of 
S&G appearing (with section references!  Did no one proof read it?) on page 
14 at the top.

- A starting scenario would have been nice.  

So how do I feel overall?  Very positive.  I feel that a lot of the 
criticism
is because people didn't want rules, they wanted another sourcebook.  Now I
can understand that - I'd like more Tekumel info too - but we did badly need
a set of rules.  Yes there are nitpicks about some of the production - but
its still the best produced set of rules Tekumel has ever had.  I think all
of us could think of extra things we'd like in it: but remember new players
are expected to start with the solo books, not with a big boxed set.  I know
it isn't all that cheap, but then what do you expect from a small company?

So I'd like to thank all those who produced it, and hope for more.

There was some talk about how to type right to left.  I found a utility
which allows the entry of text this way, and have attached it.  It was part
of a shareware distribution of greek and hebrew fonts, sfonts10.zip.  I've
cut it down to just the r2l utility.  Instructions are included.  It works 
with the Tsolyani font.

Anton:

Yes indeed the frustrations you have expressed are those of many members
of the gaming community attempting to play Tekumel.  The problem is that
those of us who have had an opportunity to play with Dr. Barker for a
number of years  tend to forget how frustrating it is for those who do not
have that opportunity.  Within our heads (and Dr. Barker's) are an
incredible wealth of details about Tekumel that would be almost impossible
to sort through, and relate.  Some of us have kept regular journals of our
adventures, to mark in details of Tekumel as we explore.  My own notes
would fill probably a half dozen modules.  They should be related to
others to enjoy.
  It is just because of that wealth of knowledge that rules become less
necessary.  When I play Tekunu hi'Qolyelmu.  I am Tekunu hi'Qolyelmu of
the Golden Sunburst Clan.  I know what my fief looks like.  I know my
retainors.  I see these things in my mind's eye.  I  don't need to roll
much because I know my limitations .  It is not so much that rules are
unnecessary as that there is little need to roll under conditions where
role playing is more of a vision or a panorama than a game.  

Alan

Also, this usually doesn't yellow as fast as the contact paper, it protects 
both the inside and outside, and if the job is screwed up, you have someone 
besides yourself to blame.

Oh Noble One Whose Quest is One with All!!!!

You played EPT in 1976!!!  Well another old hand is still kicking about. 
Did you play in the University group then?  Are you originally from
Minnesota?  The name does not immediately ring a bell.

As to materials, the new rules are out now.  But you need the Bestiary and
 Volume 1, 1  to generate a character.  The solitaire books are also fun
and give much background to bring someone "up to date" on Tekumel.  Try
going to a used book store and obtain Dr. Barker's two novels: if you
don't already have them.  As to old materials, unfortunately I did all my
Tekumel gaming with Dr. Barker so I have really nothing of my own.

Good luck and thanks for keeping up your interest.

Tekunu hi'Qolyelmu

Mr. Bob:  Tekunu here.

I agree with your positions completely.  This has been discussed before
with the Great One Whose Pen Caresses Paper Like a Perfumed Finger Tickles
the Mistress of the Gods (Dr. Barker).
  The gaming rules are only guidelines to conduct activities on Tekumel
and the gaming rules are not actually the activity itself.  When conflict
arise that require some sort of resolution that cannot be taken care of in
the context of the story line, then rules are required to resolve those
conflicts.  (Usually this is in the realm of combat or a simple
comparative die roll)  Dr. Barker has always said that formost (1) he is a
story teller and (2) the rules are secondary.  I remember many evenings
when I was never required to roll a die, but participated actively in the
story line, having a great time.  I have boiled role playing rules down to
about 8 pages at this time for my own use.

   I agree that more material is necessary.  I am currently working on an
Onchash Chairon module from materials collected during Tekunu
hi'Qolyelmu's epic quest on the Southern Continent for rare flowers to
present to Prince R.  It will include descriptions of about a half dozen
locations in the deep southern continent.

Now, if Professor Barker will give me permission to proceed, I will
gladly take on the "legwork", the scanning/typing/gathering work, and
whatever assembling that it takes.  I will submit all materials to him
and/or his representative for approval before releasing/publishing it. 
And I will submit to the censure of this newsgroup (virtual
impalement?) if I do not abide by Professor Barker's wishes.

My current plan is to collect everything and "reorg" it with a table of
contents and maybe an index.  I have the TSR EPT, Dragon #4, The Best
of the Tekumel Journals Vol.1, and the Space Gamer S&G Special Issue
(#71?).  I would like to get an approved way to collect all of the
other materials without too much trouble (or money, which I don't have
in unlimited supplies, either).

Please, all of you, look at the materials you have and send me the
names of authors other than the Professor.  Have them email me or if
you get their address to me, I'll contact them.  I will also contact
the various magazines (Dragon, Space Gamer, etc.) and try to get their
permissions.  Does anyone have current addresses for Lou Zocchi? 
Different Worlds (for example, did they turn into Sleuth Publications)?
 Does TOME have all the rights for previously published stuff?  Send
email answers to setnaffa@ix.netcom.com; send snailmail to John T.
Bailey, 1901 W Spring Creek #507, Plano, TX 75023-4220.  Anything sent
in for archiving will be returned unopened unless previously approved
by the Professor.  The last thing we need is to irritate him or TOME. 
We want to enhance interest in Tekumel, not discourage further
investment.

Here is what I have determined to be available, excluding the books
TOME is actually publishing...

so enough with the "attitude" and publish the "Fief of the Golden
Sunburst Clan" already...  :-)

What we need is men and women to share the game in a way that is
*meaningful* to others who have not shared the richness of the environs
of Tsolyanu.  I, for one, have not played for over 18 years.  But over
the last few months, I have bought almost $200.00 worth of stuff (to my
wife's disgust and amazement-- after all, it's so...old) and will buy
the new rules when I can again muster $44.00+s&h (no stores in Dallas
seem to carry it, yet!).  Be assured, I *will* play again.  Even if it
requires tricking my D&D playing friends into another world for a few
sessions.  >:->

Let's see some of those 20 years of Professor Barker's games described
by the players in great detail.  I am certain that there would even be
a certain group of players who would expend their hard-earned Kaitars
for a good story, module, or even the plans of an underground temple or
two...  (hint, hint, nudge, stomp!)  8-D

On the other hand, if you keep the game's highr moments to yourselves,
the game will die again.  And then there will be no one to revivify it.
 :-(

We're getting our second wind, and NOW is the time to JUMP!!!!

This morning I received the missing "About this game" leaflet (only 3 days 
after ringing for it, transatlantic - well done TOME), which explained them.

The insert positions the set rather well, and gives the missing Tekumel 
intro.

Good man.  Any way I can help...

A suggestion: do it in chunks.  I'd suggest concentrating on the smaller, 
more ephemeral stuff first, which will batch up nicely into one or more 
volumes.  Get round to the Sourcebook, etc, later.

gather up all the stuff you can and be ready to send me a copy when the
Professor says we can share it.

that's probably the way it will work.  i will not be republishing
rules, just source materials.

If you bought the game directly from TOME, you shouldn't need to notify them.
I got mine yesterday, without having to prompt them.

This will depend upon demand and permissions obtained.

I also played EPT in 1976.   I still have my copy of the boxed set I

read the reviews of the recently published set with interest, but what

A suggestion:  Why not gather the scenarios together, and do those 3
as a volume.  There's only 3.  One could even add the Gardasiyal stats.

The frustration of those of us whose playstyle relies more on game

whether or not the professor's group plays without dice or rules; many of 
*us* do, and it annoys us to see substandard game mechanics attached to a 
world we like so much.  It's far easier for those of you who *don't* use 
dice to simply ignore the game mechanics than for those of us who use 
dice to play with a set of rules that are not up to par.

That being said, I actually don't find the rules in Gardasiyal to be that 
bad.  What I do kind of mind is the Professor's stated objection to 
running Tekumel under any *other* set of rules.  I intend to replace the 
Gardasiyal mechanics with my own (not because the Gardasiyal rules are so 
bad, but because my group and I are more comfortable with another system) 
while using Gardasiyal as the template for world-relevant things like 
clan, lineage, education, professional rank advancement, and so on.

I just bought my copy of Gardasiyal (which means what?).

I did not get the introduction so will have to call about that.

The outer box refers to "quick reference charts." The only such charts included
in my set were the magic reference charts. Did anyone else get combat
reference charts, or am I expecting too much?

Others have made various criticisms, which at this time I view as largely
futile. No use crying over spilt milk. But NO TABLE OF CONTENTS???? I have
given up on expecting todays wonderful technology to translate into indexes,
but no tables of contents? The backs of the covers were just blank. Oh well.

[snip interesting, but off-topic chatter]

Well?  Where is the stuff?  Where is my permission to continue?  As the
man said, "Whatever is not strictly prohibited, is required."  

Or something like that...  :-)

Professor Barker:  If you do not want me to continue, would you or Bob
Alberti please contact me?  Otherwise, I will consider that I have your
implicit permission.

********************************************************************

If you "more experienced" players will take the time to write to me
(email, snailmail, fax, whatever) I'll see that your past game
experiences get published somewhere--current fanzine(s) or TOME or me.

You "less experienced" players:  Let's see a "show of hands" on this. 
Send email to "setnaffa@ix.netcom.com"" stating you would be interested
in a writeup of someone else's gaming experiences.  If not enough
people are interested, I'll just sit down and shut up.  If I get enough
response, I'll do whatever it takes to get the materials available to
all.

********************************************************************

Let's create a mailing list to pass around to various gaming businesses
(like TOME, PHD, and so on) stating that we are interested in Tekumel
related stuff.  I don't mean a "listserv", but a real-life marketing
tool.  In this way we could show the businesses that we were a viable
market.  We would be saving them money by doing their market research
for them.  And we would be able to organize ourselves a little better.

Send me an email stating you wish to be added to the list.  Perhaps
Brett or Bob could eventually allocate space on one of their webpages
to advertise for us, but for now, I'm stepping up to the plate and just
swinging.

*******************************************************************

If you want any previously published stuff to be included in the
materials I will be releasing, please go ahead and send it now. 
However, I will be doing my utmost to contact any and all interested
parties to get a release of some sort.  

********************************************************************

Will someone with a good contact at TOME email me concerning what
previously published materials are owned by TOME?  Also, I would like
to find a way to limit my output to people who have purchased the new
rules--what is the best way to handle that?

********************************************************************

Finally, whatever happened to Tekumel Games?  As far as my records
indicate, they went to Rio with all of the money.  Do they have any
stake in this game?  Did TOME get their rights?

********************************************************************

I also liked the new material, especially the Archetypes--this will be a
great tool for introducing those new to Tekumel to some of the colour of
Tsolyanu.

I confess to being apparently alone in not liking the maps so well; I find
it difficult to tell one colour/texture from another on them, as they all
look like shades of ochre.

While I'm exhibiting my curious taste, I will add that I liked Kathy
Marschall's illos in/on "Adventures.." better than Trevor Utz's.

That said, I wholeheartedly agree with previous remarks that it is nice to
have "the whole thing" for once!  Here's hoping it sells well, so that
more material will be published!

Greetings!

I've been playing EPT since the original TSR game was published way back 
when, and like a lot of Tekumel explorers I've had plentiful times when 
information about the game was everywhere to be had, and lean times when 
it seemed like there wasn't any forthcoming products.  Imagine my 
pleasure to discover my newsgroup provider had added this group.

I've got most of the Tekumel products up through TOME's solitaire 
scenarios.  Tell me about the new rules that I've seen referred to here, 
and what else is coming!

Many thanks,

Karl Thiebolt

Ook!  Signor Alberti, let me suggest that you are suffering from what the
ancient Greeks were wont to call hubris.  Gods don't make sense to humans,
so Gods are "insane"?  An interesting, but to my mind unconventional use
of the word.

A plentitude of fascinating observations.  (a) What makes you think you
can't interact with a blood cell?  You interact with millions of them
every day. (b) What is the justification for assuming that
gods/God:you::you:(apparently)unconscious matter? (c) you are misapplying
the (overhyped) postulate of William of Occam ("entia non sunt
multiplicanda praeter necessitatem"); how does the inability (even given
this dubious assertion) to interact affect one's "necessity"?

Occam is a bit of a thin reed anyway; there are far too many things in the
real world (let alone the imagination) that are far more complex than they
"need" to be.

No offense intended; I just relish a good discussion.  :-)

	Did you ever get a chance to get hold of the cassette tape that
Adventure games put out featuring Professor Barker doing Tsolyani 
language instruction?  It really helped my understanding of Tsolyani, 
since I'm better at hearing than reading a foreign tongue.
	I wonder if that tape's still available somewhere?

But actually, this is nonsense.  What we need, is to find out what people

Probably the various journals, and one-off articles?

The store I go to in Austin, TX got copies in on about the same day I

mighty suprised if they didn't get copies of Gardasiyal.  So from where

whose shops don't carry it, just ask them to order it for you!  
Distributors *will* get copies of requested products in order to fill the 
orders of the shops they service.  That's how distributors make money!

	I thought it'd be nice to have rules so a character can parry.  
Under the present rules, you'd be insane not to have a half-dozen shields 
on hand to hopefully catch some of the (massive) damage meant for you.  
They also discourages "Florentine" fighting, since you can't use either 
weapon to parry and set up a counter-reposte.  You just take the damage 
on your never-gets-damaged armor and lump the damage that penetrates.
	Well, anyway, here they are:

	Parry Rules
	-----------

	Types of Parrying Tools
	-----------------------
	U:  Bows and Light, Improvised (a shinbone, for example)
	V:  Heavy, Improvised (a wooden chair, for example)
	W:  Small, One-Handed Weapons (a dagger, for example)
	X:  Pike, Quarterstaff, Spear, Javelin or Polearm
	Y:  Long One-Handed Weapons (a sword, for example)
	Z:  Two-Handed Weapons (a Flamberge, for example)

	Parry Chart
	-----------
	D10 Score to Avoid Damage		Weapon Hit Points
	-------------------------		-----------------
	U:  1 (only)					5
	V:  1-2						10
	W:  1-3						15
	X:  1-4						20
	Y:  1-4						25
	Z:  1-5						30

	Add 1 for every 10 Levels		If weapon is steel, add 10
	in appropriate weapon skill		If weapon is enchanted,
	Steel Weapons add 1			add 20
	Enchanted Weapons add 2

	As you can see by these charts, they allow some chance of 
parrying opponent's blows.  Unless you're fighting Florentine, however, 
you forfeit your attack in order to parry.  When you are fighting 
Florentine, you may attack with one weapon and parry with the other, or 
attack with both, OR parry with both.
	The maximum number possible is if you're level 30 in a 2-handed 
weapon that's enchanted, which is 1-9.  You can still blow it by rolling 
a 10.  Also, the weapon's hit points can be increased, but the maximum 
comes out to be equal to an enchanted shield.  That means most warriors 
will still prefer a shield, but better skilled and better equipped 
warriors have options.  Not to mention non-warriors will have *something* 
with which to ward off damage, at least sometimes.
	Let me know what you think of this idea.  I'm still working on a 
hit-point system for the armor.  If you're going to represent damage to 
some of your equipment, you should represent it all!

				Sincerely,

				Rick Kurgas

I talked to my game store (in Denver, even tho' I live in Tucson Arizona) and 
ordered a copy of Gardasiyal last Thursday (today is the 26th) from Bill as he 
was unpacking his UPS boxes of them. He sent it UPS to me that day and I 
expect to get it today or tomorrow.

So _someone_ has gotten copies.

Well, my local games shop has apparently not heard of any of this yet, so could
some kind soul please post TOME's mail-order address, and any ordering information
I might need for Gardasiyal (like the price, S&H, and catalogue number if any).
Thanx.
