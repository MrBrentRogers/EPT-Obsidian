This sounds like an excellent idea.  I've only recently begun read Prof.
Barker and  WOW! am I hooked.  My friend has an outrageous collection of
Tekumel stuff.  Unfortunately he back in Med School so there's little left
for me to do.

If anyone does start up an e-mail campaign please drop me a line also...

HELP!

All I want is a copy of the '75/'76 Empire of the Petal Throne, complete 
with maps.

Yes, I know that it is like a 1st level potscrubber from the 
backstreets of Jakalla having the temerity to ask the Emperor to borrow 
the Omnipotent Azure Legion for a week, but I'm hoping that somebody out 
there (with greed overcoming their sense) can either sell me their copy 
or maybe the Professor could grant me an indulgence for a legal 
photocopy of the rules?  8-)

NOTE:  This should in no way be construed as a request for an *illegal* 
copy.  As difficult as this stuff is to get now, I do not want to make 
it more impossible...

Please respond via email unless you know of a good source for the stuff 
in which case posting it here would be "neighborly."

I am going to but the TOME game when it comes out, but it's not here yet 
and I cannot even find Swords and Glory at any of the stores I know in 
the Dallas, Texas area.


John T. Bailey

P.S., Anyone with EPT fanzines or back issues of the Metagaming 
magazines with Tekumel articles?  My parents discarded all of my stuff 
when I joined the USAF in '78...  :-(

Several years ago I ran a PBEM GURPS Tekumel campaign that went real well.
I'd love to have time to do so again.  In the mean time, I'm 
open to playing in one if someone would be so kind as to Ref it.

Well, it looks like all we need now is a GM. Unfortunately, I have no to to 
GM any role-playing game on a permanent basis, but I too would be interested
in joining (or at least trying) a PBEM tekueml. Any people out there with 
bunches of free time to GM this thing?

  G-01: What is Tekumel?

  A-01: (Theron Goudeau; I copied this from rec.games.frp.misc a while ago)

Okay, a (not really) brief description of Tekumel:  Tekumel was discovered
by explorers from HumanSpace about 60,000 years after Christ.  There was a 
terrible nuclear war on Earth sometime around the present date, and the
European nations and the U.S. and China were destroyed.  South America,
the Indian subcontinent, and the Middle East (for some reason) survived
(no mention is made in the brief intro of Africa) survived, and gradually
rebuilt and became a world state of sorts, and humanity spread to the stars,
using miraculously high technology (FTL ships--the "Three-Light Drive," 
contragravity, beam weapons, superdense alloys, androids, and power systems
which poked holes in the continuum and drew near-limitless energy through
>from  n-dimensional space).  Tekumel was a large world, but had a lighter core
and a lower density.  It was home to acidic native life forms, several of
which were sentient and had even attained early spaceflight.  Humans, and   
their alien allies, conquered the natives and terraformed the planet, making
its ecosystem very Earthlike and installing massive gravity engines which
gave it an Earthlike day and year and 1.0G.  Tekumel was situated on a major
trade route, and became a mercantile pleasure world, which had to import
metals and industrial goods for the very rich who lived there.

Then Something Bad <tm> happened.

Apparently, through unknown agency, Tekumel and its entire star system fell
into a pocket dimension.  Gravitic stresses nearly tore the planet apart,
and destroyed many cities and installations.  Interstellar trade was immediate-
ly and permanently severed.  The native races, who'd been confined in prison-
like "reservations," broke free and made war.  Civilization fell rather
messily, and the Time of Darkness descended.

Sometime after the disaster, human scientists/philosophers (perhaps aided by
the some of the more psychically-gifted nonhumans) discovered that in the new
dimension, the power of the human mind alone, unaided by technology, could
draw power through from extra-dimensional space, and "magic" developed.
The sorcerors of the ancient Empire of Llyan of Tsamra mapped nexi between
various dimensions and made pacts with various dwellers of other planes,
called "demons" by the unitiated.  Great empires rose and fell over the next
30,000 years;  the presence of "magic" (really psychic phenomena), along 
with the obvious superiority (and near-complete inscrutability) of the
sciences of the Ancients (whose technology was largely irreparable due to
a lack of necessary raw materials) led to a stagnation of the sciences, and
to societies which depended largely upon tradition, precedent, and the bonds
of family and clan for stability.

Contact was also made with a race of extremely powerful beings who were for
all human purposes gods.  These beings subtly encouraged human worship and
dependence;  great unchanging religious bureaucracies developed, and after
several millenia of religious warfare, the temples agreed upon a Concordat
which disallowed open religious conflict, which further exaggerated the
Tekumelani tendency toward stagnation.  The people of Tekumel lack the
anthropocentric belief that the universe is knowable and conquerable;  they
know that there are races and beings which dwarf them in power, and that
there are sorceries and sciences which are far beyond their grasp; intellectual
and scientific curiousity is rare and even subtly discouraged.

As a result of these historical processes, there exist upon the face of the
great primary continent of the northeastern hemisphere of Tekumel the Five
Empires, all of which are monarchical/theocratic oligarchies in which
precedent and tradition hold the strength of law, and many smaller states
which balance themselves between two or more of their larger neighbors.  There
are small enclaves of nonhuman races, most of whom owe allegiance to a human
empire, and several states ruled by the inimical races, who still hate
humanity and its allies with a passion, but are outnumbered by the more
fecund invaders.  The Five Empires (one of which is the titular Empire of the
Petal Throne, Tsolyanu) have technology about on the level of the European
Renaissance (aqueducts, good roads, simple mechanics, wheeled carts, siege
engines, crude surgery and slightly more advanced pharmacology, crossbows,
water clocks, etc.).  Their governments are greatly hidebound and bureaucratic,
like those of ancient China.  They have mighty, well-organized legions like
those of the Romans.  Their gods are like those of the Hindus, with a heavy
dose of the bloodthirsty Aztec or Mayan deities.  Their legal codes and
sciences are much like those of the Arab philosophers of the Middle Ages;
they are obsessed with personal and family honor much like the medieval
Japanese.  The societies presented with the game are very intricate and
very old (the youngest governments are some 2,500 years developed, and they
have histories, traditions, and myths stretching back some 25,000 years).
Professor M.A.R. Barker, the author of the game, is a full professor of
linguistics and anthropology;  he has developed scripts, languages (and I
mean a language one can speak, with a grammar handbook and lexicon, like
Tolkien's Elvish or Roddenberry's Klingon, in the case of Tsolyani), histories,
modes of dress, etiquettes, architectural styles, weapons and armor, religions,
legal codes, demographics, sciences, etc. for all of the major and most of the
minor cultures.

Since the societies are so intricate and formal, political maneuvering and
subtlety, combined with the right amount of heroic action and appropriate
posturing, are the keys to power, and my campaign, as well as that of
Professor Barker himself from reports, thus deal mostly with intrigue and
plotting between the various power groups, combined with expeditions after
some bit of lost knowledge or some sorcerous object from an ancient tomb (yes,
dungeoncrawling!!!).  There are bits and pieces of ancient technology which
still function (many are self-repairing within limits, others have been
maintained carefully by human and nonhuman sages, or by robot servitors);
these are fought over as powerful tools.  The game's scope is very grand;
the Tekumelani do everything *BIG*.  There are mighty legions of thousands
of soldiers wearing brightly-laquered armor, wearing great Kheshchal-plumes,
and beating huge KarengKoreng war drums, sorcerors calling on terrible
demons with secret names, giant pyramidal temples thousands of years old
upon which hundreds of war-captives are sacrificed to the Lord of Flame, etc.
Tekumelani culture is very baroque, with titles like Reader of the Peerless
Scrolls of Martial Glory, huge statues of the 97th Aspect of Lady Avanthe,
Tanule the Patron of Lovers, and twenty-three forms of the pronoun "you,"
to be used when speaking to individuals of varying status and profession!

Overall, the gameworld is quite alien to traditional FRP gamers (which I
happen to think is a good thing, but that's me).  Many people feel that it's
*too* strange, and can't be run by anyone but Barker.  I know that my gamers,
a very traditional sword-and-sorcery blood-and-thunder bunch, at first
found the difficulty of Tekumelani pronunciation and the lack of comfortable
stereotypes like barbarian, wizard, elf, orc, and dragon, to be disconcerting,
but after two years of gaming on Tekumel they like it a lot, and use
Tekumelani terms to describe *other* games and situations.  It takes some
getting used to, and a good bit of homework on the part of the GM, but if
you're looking for a gameworld that is unique, interesting, and very well-
thought-out and developed, give Tekumel a go, it's cool.  It's much better
than _Cats_.  You will play it again and again.

  G-07: What does 'M.A.R.' stand for?

  A-07: Muhammed Abd-al-Rahman. (Brett Slocum)


  G-08: What is happening with the current TOME publications?

  A-08: As of 1-20-95: (Brett Slocum)
  
  Adventures on Tekumel Part Two, Volume III "Beneath the Surface 
  of Tsolyanu" (the third book of solitaire adventures) has been out 
  since fall 1994. Gardasiyal: Deeds of Heroism is the roleplaying
  rule set. It should be released 1Q95. It will be a boxed set of
  at least four books.


  G-09: Do I have to use [insert rule system] to play a Tekumel game?

  A-09: Well, since their are currently three 'official' rule systems
        for Tekumel, I'd say a most definate 'No'. I've played using
        Runequest, Chivalry and Sorcery, Traveller, GURPS and Barker's
        "I don't need rules" style. I've heard of people using AD&D,
        Rolemaster, and several home-grown rule sets. So, the important
        thing is to play in the world, not what rules you use. (Brett
        Slocum)


  G-10: Is there a WWW page for Tekumel?

  A-10: Yes: http://wings.network.com/gopher/tekumel/tekumel.html.

John, there are two legal, in print sources of Tekumel rules available right
now, if you can't wait.  You can write Dave Morris in England, and buy
back issues of the Eye of All-Seeing Wonder.  (See Brett's FAQ for his
address)  Issues 1-3 contained the rules for Tirikelu, a rather neat little
role-playing system.  You can also buy GURPS, and pick up the current
issue of Pyramid Magazine for Brett's hefty article on GURPS Tekumel.
Those that play GURPS say it's very well suited for Tekumel.  Finally, you
might want to try to contact Andrew Lorince in Pittsburgh, who sells many
out of print things and may have copies of EPT, most likely the Different
Worlds version.

Good luck.  Oh, yeah: check rec.games.frp.marketplace for occasional sales
of Tekumel material.  Somebody is currently selling "Best of the Tekumel

I speak as one who doesn't know, but I'm betting on it.  There have always
been rules for nonhuman characters, except for Adventures in Tekumel, which
did say those rules would be included later.  Nice to know there's a fellow

A question to you all more experianced Tekumel gamers:

Would you welcome a new commer to Tekumel in the PBEM game that knows 
very little about the most interesting and exotic land of Tekumel?

I would be most happy to provide another player if that would be the case.

Just let me know, Thanks.

Greetings.  I enjoy collecting rpgs, especially ones with innovative
game mechanics or wonderful backgrounds.  The little info I've seen on 
Tekumel has led me to believe it would be a good game to look at.

I believe I did look at something in the Tekumel collection once, and
was not overly impressed, which disappointed me greatly.

What is it about Tekumel that you like so much?  Why do you play it?
Why do you collect it?  What should I get my hands on to get a fair
idea of what Tekumel is as a game/setting/environment/etc.?

Feel free to email me, but it might be nice to post -- I assume that 
more regular readers of the group might like to hear people's responses, 
assuming this thread has not already occurred.

If you are interested in receiving copy of whatever gets emailed to me,
let me know.

Thanks.

Greetings from Lord Krisala hiBeshynae, Chancellor of the City and Fief of
Hekellu, and Protectorate of the Chigari Marshes.

It is indeed most gratifying to find so many who still see the wonder of
Tekumel.  It has been a very long time since I have immersed myself in
this wonderful game, too long.  If there are players willing to gather in
Minneapolis to pursue this common interest I would be most pleased to have
you respond to my humble missive.

I have not followed the new development in the game recently but I have
collected many items over the years from the original EPT box set as well
as the S & G sets V1 & V2.  Also, I have some more obscure stuff including
some material developed by me and by other former players.

MiniCon is coming up in a couple of months.  Perhaps that would be a good
time to have a first game session if we can find enough players in the
area?  E-mail me or respond in the newsgroup if you are interested. 
Thanks.

I think many of us experience difficulties getting all of the posts to this

I think if you want to know what we find enjoyable about Tekumel you should
read one (or more) of the following

The original EMPIRE OF THE PETAL THRONE game
THE TEKUMEL SOURCEBOOK (Volume 1 of the aborted SWORDS AND GLORY game: it 
appeared in two seperate editions, one of which had the full text in one book
and one of which had legible text!)
The novels MAN OF GOLD and FLAMESONG

If none of these spark you then maybe Tekumel isn't for you.

For me the sheer richness of the background and its depth, the luxury of the
good illustrations (Tekumel has had its share of bad ones) and the sense of 
huge complex world that makes it. For me the linguistic elements are a barrier 
not an advantage but other people feel quite the opposite.

Rich-

I've got an answer for ya but you're not gonna like it.  The Dragon published
a couple of articles on EPT and the world of Tekumel-- the first time that 
Mihalli are mentioned-- way back in issues 4 and 6 of the first year that 
they were published.  These issues are very hard to get ahold of, not to 
mention being very expensive.

The articles discuss painting tips for Tekumel figures and how warfare is 
conducted by the five empires.  These two articles are in issue 4-- if my 
memory is correct.  There is also a story that comes from the Mu'uglavyani 
invasion of 2020.  They are excellent reading, but I believe that the issue 
is worth in excess of $100 to 
$200.  Contact TSR and see what the cost should be.

Well, my memory is getting crusty, and I sold off my old Dragons a long time
ago, but I think that the EPT special was #4 (or maybe #3?).  I don't
remember much about the contents--nothing spectacular.  Strategic Review #5
had a random Tsolyani name generator in it...

Also, there are some patches to RuneQuest, one set by Sandy Petersen,
and one set by Rob Smith & I. These are mostly (only? I don't remember)
related to Magic, and use a bastardization of the RQ3 Sorcery system.

Greetings, fellow admirers of Tekumel!
I normally just lurk on the Internet, but felt compelled to help out when
the subject of EPT articles in Dragon magazine and Strategic Review were
brought up.  I still have several of these issues, as well as an early
list produced by Dragon magazine showing in which issue various topics
were located.  Here is the list:

Tsolyani Names Without Tears-M. Barker-SR4, p.7
To the Everlasting Glory of the Petal Throne-M. Barker-SR7, p.20
Reports Submitted to the Petal Throne-M. Barker-Dragon 4, p.4
Jakalla Encounters-S. Klein-Dragon 4, p.10
Battle of the Temple of Chanis: 2020 A.S.-M. Barker-Dragon 4, p.12
The Mihalli-no author listed-Dragon 4, p.18
The Vriyagga-no author listed-Dragon 4, p.19
Roads From Jakalla-J. Westergaard-Dragon 4, p.23
Legions of the Petal Throne (miniatures)-no author listed-Dragon 4, p.28
"Eye Chart"-no author listed-Dragon 4, p.21
Legions of the Petal Throne Painting Guide-M. Barker-Dragon 6, p.8
Military Formations of the Nations of the Universe-M. Barker-Dragon 7,
p.16
Seal of the Imperium (EPT Q & A)-M. Barker-Dragon 9, p.21 and Dragon 11,
p.12
Distributing Eyes and Amulets in EPT-M. Crane-Dragon 20, p.6
Naming People, Places and Things in EPT-G. Rahman-Dragon 24, p.39
Birth Tables and Social Status in EPT-G. Rahman-dragon 26, p.33
A New Profession for EPT-G. Rahman-Dragon 31, p.27
This is a Tekumel Test-M. Crane-Dragon 34, p.26

Of these I have Dragon Issues 6, 24, 26, 31 and 34.  Personally I find
 #6 is still useful, as is #24.  The others are of marginal interest.
The only other EPT piece I know of (and have) from a major magazine is
White Dwarf #10, p. 6-Talismans of Tekumel, by Jack McArdle, which seem to
be some typical fantasy role playing stuff from that time period.
I don't know what the legality of making copies of any of these VERY old
articles is, so until I do, please don't ask!   
Before I sign off, here's to Brett Slocum for his article on using GURPS
to play on Tekumel-"Otule'ngba!"  My favorite world meets my favorite
system.

I've generated a new FAQ for Tekumel in HTML. It is totally
reorganized from the one recently posted here (same responses,
though). Try it out from my Tekumel Archives page, either
accessible from the main Tekumel home page 
(http://wings.network.com/gopher/tekumel/tekumel.html) or
or from my own home page (just follow the Tekumel links)
http://www.io.com/~slocum/.

Comments please!
(Yes, I know I haven't ioncluded your additions yet, Mr. Dushay.)

Hard to say, it was so long ago.  My first encounter with Tekumel was in
Dragon #7, where the article "Military Formations of the Known Universe"
was published.  I didn't understand most of it, but I liked the detail and
complexity of the game--remember, this must be compared to the original,
white box, 3 booklet D&D!  The original EPT rules didn't do that much for
me.  I found it hard to get a handle on how the game should feel, but I
did like the history, the wierd races, and the strange deities.  Over the
years I found bits and pieces here and there, and what eventually pulled me
in was the amazing depth of this game.  The last straw to making me a
committed fanatic was the Tekumel Sourcebook, vol. 1 (The Gamescience edition,
because vol 1 of the Different Worlds edition is just getting started when
it is cut.)
 
What you might like?  I dunno.  I recommend the sourcebooks--Gamescience's
if you can get it (Good luck.) and both Vol 1 and 2 of the Different Worlds
edition, which is a bit easier to find.  Check out the Book of Ebon Bindings
for sure, and Deeds of the Ever Glorious, a history of Tsolyanu's legions.
The Best of the Tekumel Journal has a lot that's not exactly "best", but
the articles on the Shen, Tinaliya, and Pe Choi are well worth reading.
Of course, the now out of print DAW books, "Man of Gold" and "Flamesong"
are very good.  I'd say skip all rules for now--if you don't like the
background, the rules aren't going to sell you, with the possible exception
of perusing the spell lists from Swords and Glory, Vol 2 (the Player's
Handbook: worth it's weight in gold and just about as hard to get).
Regrettably, nearly all of this stuff is out of print except for the Book
of Ebon Bindings, which probably should be read AFTER you've got some
basic understanding of the society and culture.
 
I would be interested in hearing YOUR response after checking some of this
stuff out.

Lyle, we're all thrilled to welcome newcomers to Tekumel.  Problem is,
I haven't heard any volunteers willing to actually run a PBM game, although
lots would like to play.
 
Where are you?  Perhaps you would have better luck joining a live game.

I have the original rules (finally).  I'll buy the new ones when they 
are published.

I have the address of the folks who make the miniatures.  I can supply 
regular medieval figures to those who just want to try out the game.

I have a wife who makes great sanwiches.  We don't allow smoking inside 
the apartment for a number of reasons (health, cat, computer, etc.), but 
you can smoke on the front or back porch (both covered).

I have a room set aside for gaming, and there are at least 4 stores 
nearby that offer tables for gamers.

Where are you Texans who want to visit Tekumel?????  Setnaffa issues the

The first time I saw anything related to Tekumel was Pyramid #11 in the
article called 'GURPS Tekumel Adventures in the Empire of the Petal throne'
by Brett Slocum and I thought it was an advertisement!
So I read the article through and found the perfect background. A few
things I didn't have a clue about, mainly the geography. I don't have the 
slightest idea what this world looks like. Any of you out there know how I
can get a map of the place?
Now to another question, what are the cities like? Is it like medival times
with huge castles? Lowly mansions? What? And crime, things like that.
One last thing concerning religious politics. Can someone leave the church
after learning magic? Are there mages who are not connected to the church
and still draw power from the church's god? Thanks for listening.

It was an advertisement. It's just that the product hasn't been made yet. :-)
I'd sure like to see a GURPS Tekumel book, but I don't know if it will ever
happen.  If it does, I'll write the rules part.  Perhaps I could get 
Prof. Barker to write the cultural stuff. Write your congressperson! :-)

I wish that a map had been put in the article. Unfortunate.  I have an ASCII
text map I once used in a PBEM campaign, if that would help. Should I post it?
If you have access to a WWW browser, look on the Empire of the Petal Throne
home page: http://wings.network.com/gopher/tekumel/tekumel.html.
There is a map of Tsolyanu there. (GIF)

>Now to another question, what are the cities like? Is it like medival times

More like Roman cities, or middle eastern ones. They are often walled, but
also lots of sprawl.  The main features are going to be the temples and
the four Palaces (Palace of the Realm, Palace of Foreign Lands, Palace
of Ever-Glorious War, and teh Palace of the Priesthoods of the Gods).
Many crimes are punishable by impalement. And class makes a big difference.
If a high clan person wrongs a low clan one, a few copper would cover
the Shamtla (money paid to the wronged party). If the situation is
reversed, where a low clan one wrongs a high clan person, then the penalty
is more likely to be slow and painful.

>One last thing concerning religious politics. Can someone leave the church
>after learning magic? Are there mages who are not connected to the church
>and still draw power from the church's god? Thanks for listening.

The Sourcebook says, "The only means of learning such a forbidden
'temple' spell is to seek out a renegade priest. Such person are both uncommon 
and dangerous. Many unfrocked clergy are charletans or possessed of
imperfect knowledge, and only the most unprincipled would dare to teach
an outsider a secret so potent as a high-level 'temple' spell --
and one so likely to deliver them over to the mercies of the
ecclesiastical executioner!"

There are the lay priests that are not really connected directly to the
temple. They can take up private service to a lord or clan, if they
want. They are not bound by the duties of clergy.  They would still
not teach a temple spell to someone. 

I'm glad you liked my article. Tell your friends!

There have been a couple of Dragon articles on Tekumel.  The big one was
issue #4 (which I don't have!).  Most of that stuff may be more easily and
cheaply found elsewhere: The Best of the Tekumel Journal, Vol 1 has a
reprint of the "Battle of the Temple of Chanis", and the information on the
Mihalli has almost certainly been expanded in the Tekumel Sourcebook, vol.
1 (either Gamescience or Different Worlds version).  It may be assumed that
this will be reprinted in the new rules (due out any day now).  The article
"Military Formations of the Known Universe" was printed in Dragon #7 (got it!)
and reprinted in the miniatures rules Legions of the Petal Throne and
Qadardalikoi.  The latter may still be found here and there.  This information
is crucial to any set of Tekumel miniatures rules, and virtually worthless
to role playing, so if Qadardalikoi is reprinted, this information will
appear as well.  Virtually all other Tekumel articles in Dragon were short
tables and game mechanics things of little value today.  It's frustrating
to not have it all, but given the huge prices these early issues of Dragon
command, I'd recommend you save your dough unless you're a true collector.
The Best of the Tekumel Journal is probably no harder to find than Dragon
#4, and cannot possibly run as much money.

MiniCon 30 will be held at the Radisson Hotel South in Minneapolis on
April 14-16, 1995.

Full Membership is $25 until 2/14/95, or $55 at the door (to discourage
the riff-raff, no doubt!)  Supporting membership is $10 until 2/14/95 and
$15 to convert at the door.

As for the presence of the illustrious "Big One" I do not know if he'll
put in an appearance this year.  He has done so in the past (I
participated in just one Tekumel experience with Prof. Barker one year)
but I do not know his plans for this year.  Perhaps if someone else in the
newsgroup who is better acquainted with him has any additional
information?

Thanks for the interest.

Your servant,

Krisala hiBeshynae, Clan of the Grey Cloak.

        I was having a muse the other day about the host of obscure 
Tekumel bits and pieces about, and the inevitability of such considering 
the age of the game, and it occured to me that it'd be good to see a 
comprehensive list of everything thats ever been published Tekumelese.
        Brett Slocum has posted under Tekumel FAQ some of the current and 
out of print products, and Monsieur Cule did a particularly fine list in 
Last province no 2 ( Dec 1992) which covered just about everything 
published, but theres been a host of magazine articles of note, in Dragon 
(4?), White Dwarf (54), Different Worlds(47 & others?) and It would be 
nice to see the complete guide to Tekumel stuff thats been printed.
        Now its kind of possible thats someones done this before and if 
so just ignore this but if they haven't then it would be of interest to 
me, and maybe others ?? and would give people an excuse to gloat about 
strange fanzines that have covered Tekumel over the years.
        So if its been done before tell us about it, or if you thinks its 
a reasnoble idea do likewise, else I'll endever to stick some sort of 
list together and leave it at that.

: barrier not an advantage but other people feel quite the opposite.

I enjoy Tekumel for a number of reasons.  There's the politics:  rich and
complex and very human and very REAL.  It's not stilted, it's not cliche,
it's full of graft and time-servers and the Peter Principle and everything
that makes human politics so awful in reality.

There's the art:  the cultures have their own artistic language, an art
history, a style and an expressiveness.  How many FRPGs have art?

There's the language.  Not merely that a separate dictionary and grammar
exist for the culture (that's been done, badly, by many others).  It's
the fact that the language has a complex history, intertwining with the
other languages on the planet, and varying from region to region.  There
is no 'common tongue' or such nonsense.

And of course the history:  2000 years of "recent" or "modern" history,
20,000 years of "standard" history, 60,000 years of "ancient" history,
100,000 years of "mythological" or "legendary" history, and another
100,000 years of "pre-history" of which only the greatest mages have
a clue at all.

But it's definitely the religion which gives the game its particular
appeal.  Intertwined with the culture, the art, politics, history and
languages of dozens of nations are over a hundred different, interrelated
religions.  There are relgions which worship different gods in the same
way, and religions that worship the same god in different ways.  There are
several pantheons worshipped by this- or that-group of nations, and
some pantheons abhorred by all.

Then there is the clan-based culture, strictly class-based but with
strange amounts of freedom within the broad restrictions.  There are the
alien creatures cohabiting the planet.  There's the magic, which has an
underlying logic.  There's the cosmology, which is rich, exciting and
well structured.

Quite frankly, it's the only "real" role playing game I've ever seen.
All others are pale, two-dimensional parodies of typical Western
archetypes.  Arthurian fantasy, its brother Tolkeinesque fantasy,
contemporary fantasy and science fiction fantasy, each of these lean
heavily upon a base of our own Culture.  

Tekumel does not.  It employs elements of Middle-Eastern, Asian, and
Native American cultures, plus items added by the author's creativity.
It is very alien to most Westerners, and this means that it either 
intrigues or repulses them.

Hi, its me again, I have a question about the languages of Tekumel.
Ok there is the following empires in Tekumel (me thinks):
Tsolyanu: the empire of the petal throne (is there a offical or common 
language spoken alot? even something as simple as a common trade language?
help me out here on why that is its name)
Salarvya : King insane, son wields power, ruled by loose monarchy (am I 
wrong? what about the terrain? jungle? desert? ...)
Yan Kor : large, once petty lords, united by Baron Ald (am I wrong here? 
what about war? what were the effects of it? are they visible? is 
Tsolyanu plotting against them in a public fashion? secretly? or not at 
all?) 
Mu'ugalavya : ruled by the four Palaces four lords with equal land areas 
(what about the terrain here? Is there a strong economy?)
Livyanu : ruled by the temples of their Shadow Gods (these guys are 
worshipped nowhere else, so I am assuming they are not part of the 10 
gods thing, right? terrain?)

Apart from this, could someone remind me what the five palaces in each 
city are? What about religious sacrifices? do all the gods want them? If 
some of them don't which ones? Thanks for reading :)

There is a problem, however. Thus far, as presented in the RPGs, and in 
supplements, the religions are one-dimensional cut-outs. Cult of War.
Cult of Fire and War. Cult of S&M. Cult of Fire and S&M....

Nowhere is the theology, mythology or psychology of these religions 
treated in the depth that the rest of the world has been treated. Where
there has been discussion, it's usually been sterile pseudo-scientific
analysis, which in no way explains, or empathizes with the people who
worship these different religions.

I'm not saying that these religions necessarily *ARE* one-dimensional,
just that their presentation so far has been.

For a model with which to compare, look at the religions described in the
stories and background written for RQ and the world of Glorantha. (However, 
do NOT look at "Gods of Glorantha". It's horribly sterile.) 

The religions of Tekumel are more or less described from the viewpoint
of an alien anthropologist viewing the culture. Gloranthan religions are 
more or less described in the terms of a member of a culture, and are 
less likely to be described in such sterile, outsider, terms.

Tekumel could use, and should have such treatments of its religions.

Hello;

	I live in Huntsville, Alabama and work with Intergraph Corporation (Computer
hardware and software company).  I have not seen anyone in the area that uses or
plays the Tekumel world.  I at one time long ago owned the old original boxed set, 
read it once and then I assume lost it in one of the collage moves fron Tulane in 
New Orleans to Birmingham, for I have not seen it since.  
	I'm 35 and not (and rarely have been) in the hack and slash role-playing that seems
to predominate the younger games masters.  I do however like to play fighter types and the
legions and the intrigue of Tekumel seem to allow for the possibility to play a truly 
rounded out statesman/warrior type.  People think that a soldier kills, burns and plunders and
never thinks, has any greater world concerns, true loyalties, or real love intrest.  (Oh well
I am probably preaching to the chior again.) 
	Any help you could provide would be great.  Thanks.

		Lyle
