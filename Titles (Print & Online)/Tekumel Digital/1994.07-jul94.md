Summary: Heeeeeere's *Siggu!*
Keywords: Ahoggya, smuggler, marmosets, OOT!

Well, someone mentioned sharing NPC profiles from our own EPT campaigns, so
I thought I'd mention my favorite original non-player character from my,
alas, now deceased Empire of the Petal Throne game.

My players, two of whom read this group, will of course know of whom (or
perhaps, of *what*) I speak:  One-Eyed Siggu, or Old Seven Eyes.

"Siggu" is "his" name, because I decided, basically arbitrarily, that "Siggu"
is a common lower-class Tsolyani name, and that "Siggu"'s real name is
unpronouncable but sorta sounds, to Tsolyani human ears, like "Siggu"
(by the way, the name is that of a lackey in the book _Man of Gold_, which
if you have not read by now you certainly should).

Siggu is basically a huge inside joke, whose appeal is mostly that of 
comic relief.  Siggu is a big ugly green-grey (I think) Ahoggya with
bronze plates riveted to his carapace, who used to be a gladiator in the
Hirilakte Arenas.  "He," as most humans tend to call it, is also quite 
a devious and cunning lump of flesh.  Siggu is a smuggler, fence, and    
general ne'er-do-well, a leader of his own gang in Jakalla.  Siggu's boys 
are all large male humans, shaved bald, who carry small trees they call
clubs.  Siggu knows his way about the Underworld of Jakalla and uses his
knowledge to smuggle goods (boats land in a secluded cove on the Mssuma
and Siggu's boys, under cover of darkness, pick up the goods and sneak them
into Jakalla).  Siggu is filthy rich, as he always seems to know what to
sell, when, and to whom, and he is an Imperial citizen, although not a
member of any clan.  His organization is useful to many of the more devious
types in Jakalla, and he is a good mercenary--once bought, he usually
stays bought.  He is called "One-Eyed Siggu" or "Old Seven Eyes" because
he lost an eye on his mouth-side face in a long-ago battle, and now
affects an eyepatch on that side, which he tends to use as his face
when dealing with humans.

When playing Siggu, I tend to squat and let my arms hang low, like a 
gorilla's, and tend to wave them about to emphasize a point.  Siggu's
voice is like that of Yoda on speed, with lots of random insults, hoots,
and annoying Ahoggya laughter thrown in--the signal gesture, which has
come to be associated with Siggu in specific and wackiness in general in
our little group of gamers, is to bonk myself on my "carapace" (i.e.,
skull) and shout "OOT!"

I can't believe I just admitted to this on the Internet.

Anyway, Siggu's role in scenarios is to provide the PC's with clues--he
is a font of information, as he has many contacts, human and nonhuman, in
Jakalla, along the river and in the south, particularly Salarvya and
Haida Pakala.  He can get rare and expensive items, or at least tell one
where to look.  He sometimes suggests missions.  The usual setting is in
the basement of the House of the Broken Ewer, a little hostel and
wineshop in the Foreigners' Quarter of Jakalla, which moves about upon
occasion (Siggu makes all the appropriate bribes to the Market Police
and certain officials within the Palace of the Realm, but is still
a little paranoid).  Word on the street will help one find the current
location of the Ewer.  Once one manages to convince the surly, shaven-
headed bartender and bully-boys of one's business, one is shown down the
steps to Siggu's "office."  There, Siggu crouches on grass mats and provides
cushion for his visitors (he seems to find the Tsolyani penchant for
higher and lower daises endlessly amusing).  He always offers some disgusting
Ahoggya delicacy, which of course no Tsolyani would disgrace him or herself
to eat in the presence of such a being even were it edible.  He often 
consumes small, living toad-like beings whole as he talks, making a quite
disgusting racket.  Like all Ahoggya, he is quite insulting and crude,
calling humans things like "Head-like-Pustule" and "Smells-like-Chlen"
and other, pseudo-American-Indian-sounding appellations.  However, he always
manages to communicate some essential bit of information, even if in
a convoluted fashion hard for the player characters (and the players!) to
understand.

Of course, Siggu is not always just a clown, and occasionally plays an
important role in the game;  he has even saved the PC's lives a time or
two, although they are mostly unaware of this fact.

As far as his game statistics go, he doesn't really have any;  he just
has a reputation for being far too tough for any three or four of the
PC's to kill.  He is a psychic dampener of the worst sort, so little
magic can affect him.  He is remarkably quick and agile for an Ahoggya,
and is very, very strong.  His ability to see through disguises is legen-
dary, as, upon three different occasions, a player character spy (who
was a Bayarshan agent who'd fled from the Yan Koryani and was now working 
for the O.A.L. but...  it's a long story) tried to disguise himself to
fool Siggu.  On each occasion, I rolled a 3 on 3d6 for Siggu's perception
roll--unbeknownst to the player, who just thought Siggu was too incredibly
canny for words.  I have since decided that that is in fact the case, and
don't even bother rolling. =)

Anyway, that's Siggu in a nutshell.  Just thought I'd share this with
you all.  

Comments and insults are of course welcome.

     It is probably foolish to attempt this at this hour, but I fear 
waiting as I do not want to lose detail while asleep.  Tonight was one of 
those incredible Tekumel experiences that makes the other 51 weeks of the 
year pale by comparison.  
    
     Our party had arrived back from an interplanar misadventure to find 
itself within an inner ritual room of a temple of Dlamelish.  The room 
unlit, strewn with soft furniture in odd shapes, and shrouded with thick 
curtains that were everywhere, so that light spells were more confusing 
than helpful.  We cut our way out, hoping no one from the temple found out 
about this until we left.   
     Our party consisted of:  Arjai hiVaisoner, Cloak of Azure Gems clan 
and priest of Ksarul; his wife Chitlasha hiTlelsu, Rising Sun Clan; 
Sanjesh hiKirisaya, sometime High Scholarly Priest of the Temple of Thumis 
of Usenanu; his wife Ais Chrai; Osumetlu hiVu'urtesh, Golden Bough, 
Hnalla; Ashyan hiVessuma, Chiteng worshipper and sometime torturer of the 
Legion of Ketl, City of the Dead, Bey Su; her husband, Kirchta, former 
member of the Court of Purple Robes, former Servitor of Silence (tongue 
restored); Eshine, priest of Hru'u and member of the Cusp of Night 
Society; Meletha hiChaika, Joyous of Vra clan, of Thri'il; and last but 
certainly not least, Sunchan, Alladal and Hisha, priests and priestess of 
Dlamelish.  
     Assisted by the latter, we emerged from the inner sanctums without 
being arrested by the temple guards, and emerged to find ourselves...  
     ...in the city of Thri'il, on the intercalary day of Chitlasha 
(Chitlasha hiTlelsu's birthday; Tsolyani children born on intercalary days 
are often named for the day -- her second son is Dashe, born on 
Turugdashe, 2365), in the year 2363.  
     We were stunned with terror.  Why?  Not merely because we were three 
years in our own past...  You see...

     On Chitlasha in 2363, Dhich'une hiTlakotani siezed the throne from 
his father, Hirkane hiTlakotane, the Stone Upon Which the Universe Rests.  
On that day, troops loyal to the Baron Ald of Yan Kor (with whom Dhich'une 
had struck an agreement -- see Man of Gold) accompanied by legions of 
Undead troops struck several northern cities in Tsolyanu, including 
Thri'il.  
     At the same time in the city of Thri'il, a new candidate for the 
throne, a worshipper of Hnalla, was to be revealed.  It is often the 
custom to reveal new Imperial heirs at the stroke of midnight of a new 
year.  
     Several of our current party were also present in the city of Thri'il 
for this ceremony.  
     So one reason we were terrified was that it was entirely possible 
that we would meet our younger counterparts within the city.  Meeting 
one's temporal counterpart is a Bad Thing and can have Bad Effects.  
     But there was a worse reason we were terrified.  You see, when the 
candidate was introduced for the FIRST time, before our party knew that 
Undead and Yan Koriani troops were invading the city, one of our party had 
assassinated the new Hnalla candidate.  And that event had triggered a 
series of events which led to a time-branch which led to the destruction 
of Tekumel.  
     Subsequently, by means too complicated to explain, our party had 
escaped the time loop when the assassin withheld his deathblow, and time 
had moved forward.  
     We had never understood why the assassin had refrained from striking 
down the prince, allowing us to escape the loop, but now we knew.  Despite 
the fact that meeting oneself in time is a Bad Thing, we would have to go 
and stop our past selves from allowing the assassination to occur -- 
otherwise we would be trapped in the subsequent time loop once again, this 
time for good.  
     As we dashed frantically across the city to the Governor's Palace 
where the presentation was to take place, another thought occurred to us.  
Upon sparing the Hnalla candidate in our own past, we had been forced to 
survive the Seige of Thri'il.  This had been a perilous event, for the 
dread Weapon Without Answer had been turned upon the city, enclosing it 
within an impenetrable dome.  Magic, nexus points, and physical travel did 
not work to penetrate the dome to escape!  Should we succeed in preventing 
the assassination, we would once again be trapped in a city swarming with 
Yan Koriani and Undead troops, this time without the shelter of our 
Clanhouses and Temples, because we could not risk continued exposure to 
our own counterparts!  
     It could not be helped.  To minimize risk and confusion, it was 
decided that only one of our party, the noble Osumetlu hiVu'urtesh, would 
attempt to stop the assassin.  Otherwise, the more of us who entered the 
Palace, the greater the chance of meeting ourselves.  
     Osumetlu entered and located several of our younger selves (Arjai of 
2363, his wife, and a Livyani woman named Ru'a) to secure their aid, 
telling them only that he needed to find the assassin.  Not knowing what 
was to transpire, they led him inwards.  
     Suddenly a black-robed figure struck!  Leaping at Osumetlu with a 
poisoned dagger, he missed and was slain by a vicious chop to the throat 
by the Priest Arjai, who reacted with the martial arts training of his 
youth.  Osumetlu moved forward, and another black-robed figure stabbed him 
with a lethal barbed and poisoned dagger.  
     Who were these interlopers?!  Osumetlu knew; they were agents from 
the future like himself, sent to ensure the success of the assassination 
-- and the destruction of Tekumel!  He slumped bloody and poisoned to the 
ground, and as his conciousness flickered, so did hope for all of Tekumel!

     The priest Arjai leapt forward, and finding the dagger unremovable, 
did what had to be done, shoving it through his friend's torso and out the 
back.  The body gushed blood as his wife stepped up with a healing spell.  
Arjai attempted to cast a spell as well, and was staggered by a shock -- 
he had forgotten to cast away the large copper dagger, really almost a 
short sword.  Fortunately his wife was more astute, and cast an 
alleviation upon Osumetlu.  His eyes flickered open as the guards arrived. 
 
     Pandemonium was breaking out, mere seconds after the first 
black-robed figure had struck.  Imperial Guards, reacting with trained 
swiftness, descended to secure the chamber where the new prince was to be 
revealed.  Bloody and weak, Osumetlu answered their demands for 
information with the news that an assassin was going to try for the 
Prince.  
     Suddenly there was a sense of unreality, a sense of shifting and 
strangeness for those near the wounded Hnalla priest.  He looked... and 
saw his younger counterpart staring in amazement as this gaunt, bloody and 
older version of himself!  Afflicted with the sense of revulsion all those 
feel who encounter themselves in this way, as a magnetic pole rejects its 
own polarity, he began to move swiftly away when his older self called out 
the assassin's name.  "You must prevent him from doing what he is 
planning!" the older Osumetlu cried as the young Arjai supported him.  
"Hurry!"  
     His younger self moved to obey.  As further guards claimed Osumetlu 
from him, the younger Arjai decided also to assist, and hurriedly made 
himself invisible.  Although altruism was not part of the Ksarul priest's 
nature, he had just watched a man barrel through two assassins and take a 
near-fatal wound only to rise undaunted in his determination.  Whatever he 
was trying to accomplish, it seemed, might be of an importance that 
transcended simple inter-temple rivalries.  Buffeted by the crowd, he and 
Osumetlu approached the assassin together, just as that one raised his 
hand to cast the lethal spell.  Osumetlu called out, and the Ksarul priest 
cast a spell of Domination!  
     The hand pointed towards the place where the Prince observed the 
melee below him....   and dropped to the assassin's side.  Guards hustled 
the Prince off the dais...

     There is more to tell, but more than I can easily relate or you would 
easily understand.  Of the OAL officer who scanned the mind of Osumetlu of 
2365, and later met a dark figure who slew him lest he reveal what was to 
be, and plans as yet unrevealed.  Of the candidate Prince, still 
unrevealed now, and how he disappeared as the Yan Koriani and Undead 
invaded the palace.  Dead?  No.  But where he went and what became of him 
I cannot tell you, for that story remains unwritten.  Of our intrepid 
adventurers, who risked destruction to counter the Weapon Without Answer 
and escape the city, while not altering the outcome for their previous 
incarnations.  And of the assassin, who now stands at the right hand of a 
Prince, and the Prince, who now stands...   but as I said, that is 
unwritten.  
     The river of time flows forward, and its ripples are subtly changed.  
The Weaver weaves, and combs the knots from the tapestry.

Whoops, ok for the second time.

Having enjoyed reading Therons NPC profiles and Bretts Amazing adventure
(lets have some more creative stuff!) I though I'd post a profile I did
for my group here in Bradford.  The group was composed almost entirely
of Tekumel Newbies, some of whom had played Mike Cules 'Welcome to
Jakalla' introductory scenario - see iss 1 'EoASW'.  I thought that a
party summary for each player would help them get a better role-playing
grip on things.  We ended up with some interesting and well rounded
characters, and whats more people called each other by their character names.
I also tried to include some current politics in the desciptions to give
them an idea of what was going on.

 Anyway see what you think,

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Empire of the Petal Throne 
-The Bradford Campaign- 

	The Cast.


Suru'Arra  hi Nezar 

Ever the charming bureaucrat, Suru's rapid rise from clerk in Sokatis to
fifth circle department head in Pala Jakalla has bewildered elders at
Scroll of Wisdom clan.  However it is at this crucial stage of his career
that mistakes will cost him dearly, especially since the cronies of the
new Emperor are pushing both time-servers and new recruits to one side in
an effort to gain a tighter grip on the Imperial bureaucracy.  Suru seems
to know the score and always dresses to impress, wearing just the right
amount of jewellery and makeup for every occasion.  With a keen interest
in politics and intrigue Suru is just the man to know in the Palace of the
Realm.


Jnek Zuluer  hi Rasaum 

Pala Jakallan born and bred, and a real lad about town if you believe the
priestesses at the House of the Pleasant Hour.  Jnek is a business
administrator for his own Green Kirtle Clan and tries to double up as
public relations officer, at least when it comes to pretty girls from
visiting clans.  Although educated and well to do he has also joined the
local militia, in part to gain favour with his military uncle, but most
see it as a cunning ploy to appear more macho to the young ladies.  The
militia has seen a fair bit of training recently since Lord Rereshquala hi
Tlakotani took effective control of Jakalla and the south.  Opportunities
for promotion will no doubt arise shortly, will Jnek become an officer,
does he want to?  Only time will tell. 


The Lads 

Tsokel  hi Varrene' 

This recently mustered out Tirrikamu (sergeant) of the 15th Imperial Heavy
Infantry, the Legion of the Ruby Hand has just arrived in Pala Jakalla. 
Along with his companion Randu he hopes to prosper as a 'soldier for hire'
using his experience and the unstable political situation to find wealth. 
Since the rise of Emperor Dhichune the '15th' have been moved to Jakalla
by Kerdu (General) Bushu'un hi Ssanmiren.  This is obviously a political
move from Bushu'uns cousin Lady Mnella, a firm friend and supporter of
Lord Rereshquala.  Reasons for leaving, better ask him, but being a legion
funded by the aristocratic 'Sea Blue' clan promotion past tirrikamu is
tough for a country boy.  Tsokel is from a small land owning family of the
Golden Dawn Clan, he was born and spent much of his early years in a
village south of Butrus near the Pan Chakan forests.  Despite the origins
Tsokel seems to fit into city life with ease.


Randu  hi Daichar 

Like his friend and former sergeant Tsokel, Randu mustered out of the
'15th' in order to find profit, incurring heavy 'short term' financial
penalties for the privilege.  After leaving the legion they tried to find
work in Jakalla, but the work available was either poorly paid or below
their station.  Luckily through clan connections Randu found out that work
was to be had in Pala Jakalla fifty tsan to the north, and that a distant
clan cousin was in a similar situation.  Donning their kit they headed for
PJ.  Randu is a member of a middling lineage of the Silver Lightening Clan
and hails from the great city of Tumissa to the west.  Since being in the
legion a lot of time has been spent in the capital Bey Su, with only the
occasional manoeuvres across country.  The name Randu is of interest as it
is also the name of a small nocturnal bird of prey found in the Chakan
forests, this bird is renowned for its keen night vision.  Good man to
know of you want quality furniture, that being the family business.


Achan  hi Kirreshmu 

A man of some standing, the Kirreshmu family are renowned in the higher
circles of Sokatis for their fine gems and jewellery.  Achan himself must
have decided early on that he was better suited for a military career as
he managed to bring substantial honour to his family.  This was achieved
by joining the 7th Imperial Archers, the Regiment of the Clan of the
Silver Lightening and attaining the rank of Hereksa (lieutenant). 
Obviously his position as a member of a high lineage in the Silver
Lightening Clan helped, but his ability as a scout was well regarded even
to the point of receiving a commendation from the Pachi Lei general Vrogga
Dzh-Urru himself.  Since fulfilling the six year term lieutenant Achan is
taking a hopefully profitable holiday before making a final decision on
whether to re-enlist.  Fate has brought him to Pala Jakalla where he has
met Jnek, having had a good time for a while he now feels the need to gain
some temporary employment.  It appears that a distant clan cousin and his
comrade in arms will shortly be arriving in PJ, a possible business
proposition awaits.


Nudno of the North

A bit of a dark horse this one, currently residing in the foreigners
quarter he seems to hail from the far north of Tsolyanu possibly even from
Milumanaya.  One thing is certain he is a man of the mountains, anyone who
has met a mountain man will recognise his manner, dress and accent.  Some
have speculated that he is half Milumanayani or that he was once in a
crossbow legion (Glorious Destiny?) but nothing is confirmed.  Most stay
clear of Nudno and none have seen his face for he wears a turban like mask
to cover his face and head, young children are directed away by their
mothers and old women make signs of protection if they should accidentally
cross his path.  He appears to be a worshipper of one of the dark trinity
possibly Hru'u but what he is doing in PJ is any ones guess, nobody asks
that sort of question in the foreigners quarter.  Once you get over the
stigma of his unknown status Nudno seems to be relatively cultured (for a
semi-barbarian) and friendly.  He is currently for hire as a mercenary or
bodyguard, but has found little success due to the Tsolyani obsession with
appearance and status.


The odd one out? 

Gara'shen, Priest of Wuru 

A priest of Wuru with a mottled background.  Originally from the town of
Tu'unmra in the NW near Mrelu, this shows in his accent as does his lowly
clan status.  The way he speaks misleads you to think of a lowly man but
his rank as a priest contradicts this.  Gara'shen may have the appearance
of a priest but has the bearing of a man trained in the military, some
legion experience is apparent to other soldiers.  The colours black and
purple are popular in his clothing for obvious reasons, and he also seems
to wear numerous charms and amulets.  However none of this seems to
enhance his appearance any, he is still an evil looking priest of the dark
trinity who is bound to send demons to you while you sleep, at least that
is what your mother is bound to say.  Equally at home with a sword or a
history book Gara'shen is a man of contradiction which is why he makes an
ideal priest of Wuru.  What the future holds for him in PJ no one knows,
but it bound to interesting if he's got anything to do with it.  Associate
with this man at your own risk, remember, your mother wouldn't like it -
probably.

I have heard from the guy who does Barker's layout and typesetting
that the films for Adventures on Tekumel Part two, Volume III
(The third book of solitaire adventures) went to TOME about three
weeks ago. All TOME needs do is print and distribute.

Also, the text is complete for the RPG rules. I will be getting a
copy to playtest and you folks will get a review. He's now starting
work on doing the layout for this book.

I've completed a list of all names, lineages and clans from the following
books:

Original EPT
Swords and Glory Player's Handbook
Advnetures on Tekumel, Part One: Growing up in Tsolyanu
AoT: Part Two, Volumes I-II
Tekumel Bestiary (there were none)

I will either post them or put them up on the ftp area on io.com,
depending on the final size. There will probably be several lists
including one the has clans and their lineages.

If anyone would gather names for the other sources, especially
the novels and the sourcebook, please email them to me for
inclusion. What I need are :

    (1) full names, where possible
    (2) nationality, where possible
    (3) clan, where possible

One thing I want to develop are national name lists. THis is because
I have a name generator program (also going to be put in the ftp directory)
that takes a list of sample words as input and generates words using
the same letter frequencies and combinations. This is the best name
generator I've seen, with a 'Usable Ratio' of over 40%.
By having nationality name lists it shouold be possible to generqate
names of whatever country you need.

Thanks for your help on this project.

  G-01: What is Tekumel?

  A-01: (Theron Goudeau; I copied this from rec.games.frp.misc a while ago)

Okay, a (not really) brief description of Tekumel:  Tekumel was discovered
by explorers from HumanSpace about 60,000 years after Christ.  There was a 
terrible nuclear war on Earth sometime around the present date, and the
European nations and the U.S. and China were destroyed.  South America,
the Indian subcontinent, and the Middle East (for some reason) survived
(no mention is made in the brief intro of Africa) survived, and gradually
rebuilt and became a world state of sorts, and humanity spread to the stars,
using miraculously high technology (FTL ships--the "Three-Light Drive," 
contragravity, beam weapons, superdense alloys, androids, and power systems
which poked holes in the continuum and drew near-limitless energy through
from n-dimensional space).  Tekumel was a large world, but had a lighter core
and a lower density.  It was home to acods for the very rich who lived there.

Then Something Bad <tm> happened.

Apparently, through unknown agency, Tekumel and its entire star system fell
into a pocket dimension.  Gravitic stresses nearly tore the planet apart,
and destroyed many cities and installations.  Interstellar trade was immediate-
ly and permanently severed.  The native races, who'd been confined in prison-
like "reservations," broke free and made war.  Civilization fell rather
messily, and the Time of Darkness descended.

Sometime after the disaster, human scientists/philosophers (perhaps aided by
the some of the more psychically-gifted nonhumans) discovered that in the new
dimension, the power of the human mind alone, unaided by technology, could
draw power through from extra-dimensional space, and "magic" developed.
The sorcerors of the ancient Empire of Llyan of Tsamra mapped nexi between
various dimensions and made pacts with various dwellers of other planes,
called "demons" by the unitiated.  Great empires rose and fell over the next
40,000 years;  the presence of "magic" (really psychic phenomena), along 
with the obvious superiority (and near-complete inscrutability) of the
sciences of the Ancients (whose technology was largely irreparable due to
a lack of necessary raw materials) led to a stagnation of the sciences, and
to societies which depended largely upon tradition, precedent, and the bonds
of family and clan for stability.

Contact was also made with a race of extremely powerful beings who were for
all human purposes gods.  These beings subtly encouraged human worship and
dependence;  great unchanging religious bureaucracies developed, and after
several millenia of religious warfare, the temples agreed upon a Concordat
which disallowed open religious conflict, which further exaggerated the
Tekumelani tendency toward stagnation.  The people of Tekumel lack the
anthropocentric belief that the universe is knowable and conquerable;  they
know that there are races and beings which dwarf them in power, and that
there are sorceries and sciences which are far beyond their grasp; intellectual
and scientific curiousity is rare and even subtly discouraged.

As a result of these historical processes, there exist upon the face of the
great primary continent of the northeastern hemisphere of Tekumel the Five
Empires, all of which are monarchical/theocratic oligarchies in which
precedent and tradition hold the strength of law, and many smaller states
which balance themselves between two or more of their larger neighbors.  There
are small enclaves of nonhuman races, most of whom owe allegiance to a human
empire, and several states ruled by the inimical races, who still hate
humanity and its allies with a passion, but are outnumbered by the more
fecund invaders.  The Five Empires (one of which is the titular Empire of the
Petal Throne, Tsolyanu) have technology about on the level of the European
Renaissance (aqueducts, good roads, simple mechanics, wheeled carts, siege
engines, crude surgery and slightly more advanced pharmacology, crossbows,
water clocks, etc.).  Their governments are greatly hidebound and bureaucratic,
like those of ancient China.  They have mighty, well-organized legions like
those of the Romans.  Their gods are like those of the Hindus, with a heavy
dose of the bloodthirsty Aztec or Mayan deities.  Their legal codes and
sciences are much like those of the Arab philosophers of the Middle Ages;
they are obsessed with personal and family honor much like the medieval
Japanese.  The societies presented with the game are very intricate and
very old (the youngest governments are some 2,500 years developed, and they
have histories, traditions, and myths stretching back some 25,000 years).
Professor M.A.R. Barker, the author of the game, is a full professor of
linguistics and anthropology;  he has developed scripts, languages (and I
mean a language one can speak, with a grammar handbook and lexicon, like
Tolkien's Elvish or Roddenberry's Klingon, in the case of Tsolyani), histories,
modes of dress, etiquettes, architectural styles, weapons and armor, religions,
legal codes, demographics, sciences, etc. for all of the major and most of the
minor cultures.

Since the societies are so intricate and formal, political maneuvering and
subtlety, combined with the right amount of heroic action and appropriate
posturing, are the keys to power, and my campaign, as well as that of
Professor Barker himself from reports, thus deal mostly with intrigue and
plotting between the various power groups, combined with expeditions after
some bit of lost knowledge or some sorcerous object from an ancient tomb (yes,
dungeoncrawling!!!).  There are bits and pieces of ancient technology which
still function (many are self-repairing within limits, others have been
maintained carefully by human and nonhuman sages, or by robot servitors);
these are fought over as powerful tools.  The game's scope is very grand;
the Tekumelani do everything *BIG*.  There are mighty legions of thousands
of soldiers wearing brightly-laquered armor, wearing great Kheshchal-plumes,
and beating huge KarengKoreng war drums, sorcerors calling on terrible
demons with secret names, giant pyramidal temples thousands of years old
upon which hundreds of war-captives are sacrificed to the Lord of Flame, etc.
Tekumelani culture is very baroque, with titles like Reader of the Peerless
Scrolls of Martial Glory, huge statues of the 97th Aspect of Lady Avanthe,
Tanule the Patron of Lovers, and twenty-three forms of the pronoun "you,"
to be used when speaking to individuals of varying status and profession!

Overall, the gameworld is quite alien to traditional FRP gamers (which I
happen to think is a good thing, but that's me).  Many people feel that it's
*too* strange, and can't be run by anyone but Barker.  I know that my gamers,
a very traditional sword-and-sorcery blood-and-thunder bunch, at first
found the difficulty of Tekumelani pronunciation and the lack of comfortable
stereotypes like barbarian, wizard, elf, orc, and dragon, to be disconcerting,
but after two years of gaming on Tekumel they like it a lot, and use
Tekumelani terms to describe *other* games and situations.  It takes some
getting used to, and a good bit of homework on the part of the GM, but if
you're looking for a gameworld that is unique, interesting, and very well-
thought-out and developed, give Tekumel a go, it's cool.  It's much better
than _Cats_.  You will play it again and again.

Cool.   I was quoted about Tekumel on the Tekumel newsgroup.  I can die
now.

Of course, re-reading it, I was thinking, "Wow, this is pretty entertain-
ing. *I* wrote this?"  Must have been late one night...    I certainly
never saved a copy.  But then, I seldom do.

Thanks to Brett for thinking it was worth re-printing!

Hey, if you need some grist for the mill, here's a program
that might help ... It's written in perl and is invoked like so:

% lc -510 tsolyani | good | pr -7

I'll be happy to generate any number of names/words for people who
would like to have them but can't execute this program.  Just send
me mail.  :-)

Obviously, many of these words need some help on the way to becoming
a Tsolyani name ... but I reckon y'all can see that (and that the
algorithm used occasionally kicks out a word identical to what was
input, e.g. bejjeksa).  It should be fairly clear how to create new
datafiles for other Tekumelani names, which I'd be very interested in
seeing myself.

Does this use the same algorithm as the names2 program from
comp.sources.misc from many volumes ago? 

Also, what is this filter called 'good'?

And, where did you get the word list? Is that from my posting
to the Tekumel Digest?

I know, I know. Nothing but questions.

Can't say for sure.  When I wrote it, I wasn't looking at anyone else's
code, but I later heard that the same algorithm I was using was published
in (I think) Scientific American.  Basically, if you hand the program data
that looks like "argan artargan", it would build an associative array like:

Doublet:   Next Char:
      ar = ggt
      rg = aa
      ga = nn
      an =   
      n  = a
       a = r
      rt = a
      ta = r

It initially selects a random doublet and one of the chars from next char,
from which point it begins choosing the next char based on the last two known
characters.  I have a different program that builds words based on
the replacement of phonotactic rules, but it's very difficult to write a set
of rules that approximate Tsolyani or most any other given language; it's only
good for languages you're building up from scratch, I'd say, and even then
it's a hard thing to do. 

>Also, what is this filter called 'good'?

The algorithm above has a tendency to create a buttload of word < 4 characters
and also some godawfully long words. 'good' cuts off the end of long words and
munches short ones.  You may have noticed that the sample output included some
words with phonologically improbable endings ... (At least for Tsolyani :-) 

>And, where did you get the word list? Is that from my posting
>to the Tekumel Digest?

Uh, I don't think so.  I mean, I was subscribed to the Tekumel Digest for 
some time several years ago, and I definitely had a list of Tsolyani names
worked up for some name generator written in C that was being circulated at
the time, but I'm pretty sure I typed the words in myself (and that I added
some more to the list last summer).  It's possible that a word list you
posted is in there somewhere, but I definitely remember going through the
books at least once several years ago and once last summer to build up a
Tsolyani wordlist for random name generation.

>I know, I know. Nothing but questions.

No problem.  BTW, I've unpacked a lot of net.name.generators, but I've
definitely been most satisfied with this one for generating Tsolyani and
Gloranthan words and names.  It doesn't handle lengthy, non-homogeneous
wordlists very well (i.e. feeding it an English dictionary), but with a
small corpus of somewhat similar yet variegated words, it works pretty well.

Deeper Background:

  M.A.R. Barker is a retired university professor.  He specialized in 
South and Southwestern Asian languages and literature.  He is the 
author of scholarly books on Urdu and other languages.

  Since he was ten years old (before 1940), Barker has worked on a 
fictional world of his own creation named Tekumel.  He was
particularly interested in the languages of Tekumel he invented.
Prof. Barker has always reminded me of J.R.R. Tolkien,
who also devoted his life to the languages, history and cultures
of a world of his imagination (though I should note that Middle
Earth and Tekumel bear no resemblance to each other whatever).

  A role-playing game set on Tekumel and written by Prof. Barker
was published in 1975 by TSR, Inc.  titled _Empire of The Petal Throne_.
This game and related supplemental materials have been sporadically
published by various companies from then till now.  A new edition
of the game is currently being published by Theatre Of The Mind 
Enterprises, Inc. (TOME).

  Later Prof. Barker wrote the two novels mentioned above.  A third
novels is not yet finished.

  While Prof. Barker and Tekumel have a devoted following, his
Tekumel-based works have never been successful enough
commercially to establish themselves in the marketplace.

  Raymond E. Feist has written a series of novels set in a world
that many people find suspiciously similar to Tekumel.  Since I
have not read Mr. Feist's books, I can't comment on it myself.

  I have read, in net.discussions on the matter, that the books
in question are dedicated to a role-playing group that Mr. Feist
played with.  It is speculated that Tekumel-related material
was used by the group, and that Mr. Feist may have used ideas
from the gaming group in his books without realizing that they
derived from material copyrighted by Prof. Barker.  Note that
this paragraph is speculative hearsay.

  I have read that Prof. Barker has considered legal action,
but not taken any as yet.

  I have also read that Mr. Feist denies any connection between
his work and Prof. Barker's and is quite fed up with being
asked about it.

  There is a USENET newsgroup devoted to Prof. Barker's

 Yep ... and I have this one too. Both an enjoyable read.

 .. and I have this one, too. The TSR Edition, but before they put it in
 a fancy box and all. Just a clear plastic bag with game and maps and all
 the rest. Seemed real interested in the written languages as well, from
 my assessment of the game book.

 Long time since the second ... didn't think he'd go for a third volume.

 The most obvious series was pretty much the choja of Kelewan which
 figured more prominently in the collaborative works of Feist/Wurts
 than in the original 4 Riftwar books by Feist alone. But that's an
 awful stretch I think. The Kelewanese and Tekumelian cultures were
 quite different, IMHO.

 Like cloud on cloud. . . ."

The two books are well worth reading, though, if you can find them.
I'm sorry he never finished the third book...

 .. and I have this one, too. The TSR Edition, but before they put it in
 a fancy box and all. Just a clear plastic bag with game and maps and all
 the rest. Seemed real interested in the written languages as well, from
 my assessment of the game book.

 Long time since the second ... didn't think he'd go for a third volume.

 The most obvious series was pretty much the choja of Kelewan which
 figured more prominently in the collaborative works of Feist/Wurts
 than in the original 4 Riftwar books by Feist alone. But that's an
 awful stretch I think. The Kelewanese and Tekumelian cultures were
 quite different, IMHO.

The two books are well worth reading, though, if you can find them.

Summary: It's time for that wacky Blue Room guy, Lord "Shecky" Ksarul!
Keywords: marmosets, send Gruganu for pizza, Blue Room

This is a transcript of an e-mail conversation between Jason Corwin,
who formerly played an assassin of the Clan of Whispered Fear, a
devotee of Lord Ksarul (whose name I shan't reveal as then his clan would
have to hunt me down and kill me--they may not like even this much being
revealed).  Reprinted with the implied permission of the participants.

Jason Corwin unconvincingly claims:

}I have once again named my computer Ksarul (got a new one, it's great). I have
}also named my printer Gruganu.

Don't make eye contact.  Back away slowly.  Nod and smile.

I hope He doesn't get angry with you for this;  he might think naming
devices of the Ancients after Him, when he controls all such things,
is blasphemous or something.  Then again, you could bribe him with a
Pudding Pop or two.  Can't get Pudding Pops in the Blue Room.

I think I'll post this to the newsgroup.  =)

Jason adds: 

}Actually the computer is named "The Blue Room" and the owner is Ksarul. I hope
}He doesn't view it as blasphemy, it's really an form of honoring Him. At 
}least that's how I see it.

Anybody have a log of the Ksarul jokes that showed up here a few months back?
Or could the original poster re-post them?  If we attract His attention
enough maybe he'll send Gruganu, his Black Angel, to like turn us all
into Kuruku or something.  Wheeee!

I have corresponded with Feist regarding this on CompuServe about six

The problem with this story on his part is that it means he is either

2) a liar and a plagarist, who also happens to be a hack.

There is no question that Feist's "Kelewan" is Tekumel.  One has only to
look at the map of Kelewan drawn in one of his novels see the city of 
"Yankora" north of the Tsurani empire to realize that that's Yan Kor, north

  Gawd forbid that R. Feist borrow upon medieval oriental

Barker drew upon them himself).

  Yup, if not for Barker, Feist would be a nobody alright (pardon
me, I seem to have spilled a little sarcasm on myself). If he did
rip off the world, I consider this even further proof of Feist's
brilliance, to have written a thoroughly enjoyable series like
the Riftwar Saga (without an ounce of creativity you claim) from
such a second-rate miserable source as the _Empire of the Petal
Throne_ RPG.

general stuff that is easier to dismiss.

Sorry, "Yan Kor" and "Tsolyanu" do not draw from medieval oriental archetypes,
and Feist's "Yankora" and "Tsurani" don't either.

Hey, and don't forget that he ripped off J. R. R. Tolkein for the
non-Kelewan portion of the novels, too.  I suppose Tolkein combined with
Barker could vault even the most inept of writers into best-seller status.
In fact, that's just what happened.

It is clearly a waste of time to discuss quality writing with someone who
thinks Feist's works are anything more than mediocre, all questions of their 
originality aside.  I need only point to the lame and stupid manner in 
which Guy du Bas-Tyra is "reformed" in the third novel of the Riftwar series
to illustrate my point.  During the first two novels he is a cliche villain,
locking the asthmatic father of the beautiful maiden in a dungeon where he
nearly dies of pneumonia.  But for the third novel he is suddenly a "good guy"
when explains that he was only trying to save the kingdom.  Yeah, there's
some quality writing, hoo-boy.

It cannot be argued that Feist's books are immensely popular and sell very
well.  However, may I point out several other pieces of crap which also sell
well?

Top Ten Crappy Things that Sell Really Well

10) MTV
 9) Network Television
 8) Harlequin Romances
 7) Anything by Madonna
 6) Rush Limbaugh
 5) Freeze-dried coffee
 4) Cosmopolitan Magazine
 3) Totino's Frozen Pizza
 2) Microsoft Windows

and the number 1 Crappy Thing that Sells Really Well...

 1) Anything By Raymond Feist

That doesn't make it Tekumel.  If it were, Barker might have a cause
of action.  That it has many, but unimportant, similarities to Tekumel
has been fully explained, over and over again, by Ray.

Not that the Barkerite fanboys listen, mind . . .

There was, also, the legal reason.  And although Don was considered
among the most litigious folks in the business, he wanted no part of
the nuisance suit.  Getting involved in a nuisance suit is a bad idea,
unless one is as judgment proof as the more virulent of the Barker
fanboys.

Besides, if he had sued, he would have lost, and Barker's fanboys would
have to whine about something else.

In fact, DAW published the two Barker novels with a fair amount of
push; a quick perusal of either would suggest why they failed to find
an audience.

Ray has become famous and wealthy off of about ten novels -- the
bestselling hardcover was Faerie Tale, by the way, a standalone horror
novel which even the most rabid Barkerites don't take credit for --
but the novels he has gotten famous for and wealthy from are his own.

He's answered this question over and over again, every time he's been
asked -- at least three times, in my presence, by a member of Barker's
tiny little coterie.  As of yesterday (he called to chat, as he
occasionally does; we're friends of some years standing with him and
his wife), he wasn't particularly fed up, but had finally decided to
take my advice of some years ago and write out a boilerplate FAQ to
deal with it, as some of the judgement-proof Barkerites won't stop
yowling about this and spreading disinformation.

That won't stop them, of course; but it will make responding a somewhat
more automatic process.

[flame bait deleted]

The story is that Feist based his Riftwar Saga on a D&D/EPT
campaign he played in. He supposedly didn't know what the
source was. He asked the DM for permission to publish books
in Midkemia and Kelewan. The DM said 'yes' without telling him
the source of the Kelewan. Of course, this is hearsay and
not admissable in a court of law. That Midkemia was a part of 
this campaign is documented in the Midkemia Press publications
of Tulan of the Isles, Carse, and the Cities book. 

Kelewan is a hot world with little metal, no riding beasts,
creatures with six legs, an insectoid race, 20 gods divided 
into 10 Greater gods and 10 lesser ones, and the world was 
pushed into another dimension that had no stars. 

The Tsurani emperor nevers leaves his palace, the society is static 
and hasn't significantly changed in thousands of years, and arena 
combat is popular. Weapons and armor are made from non-metal materials
and hardened to nearly steel hardness in a chemical process.

Tekumel and the Tsolyani empire are the same in each of those details.

That is not to say that *every* detail of Kelewan is *identical* to
Tekumel. Nor are some of these critical to the story. As Mr.
Rosenburg points out, Kelewan is not identical to Tekumel. But regardless
of what Mr. Feist says, many of these are difficult to account for
by 'drawing on the same historical sources' or sheer coincidence.

And yes, I enjoyed the Mistress books. But, I only buy them
off the used rack, since I want no part of paying royalties
to Feist. It does seem that Mr. Feist's plotting has improved over
time, and Janny Wurts didn't hurt.

Joel, I've been thinking of writing some military SF. I'll make my 
characters mercenaries, like the Dorsai, and Jewish because I know that 
culture best. I'll make their homeworld arid and resource-poor to justify 
their willingness to die as mercenaries. Oh yes, and I'll lend some mystique 
to my soldiers by training them in an ancient style of fighting - perhaps 
an oriental one.

You won't *mind*, will you Joel? I mean, those elements are well 
established in SF. We're just drawing on sources common to us.

In any of your books have you mentioned the fact that you drew ideas from these
people?  You have taken the one step that Feist never did, admiting that you
used something from another author instead of blowing it off as some sort
of gaming slip up.  Prof. Barker has said many times that if Feist had just

Well, that turns out not to be the case.  Magician couldn't have been
taken from any novel Barker wrote; it was published years before
Barker's book was.  You can read Ray's FAQ, when released, for the
details of how some minor items from Barker's game came to be in his
books, or you could have just asked Ray; he's been upfront about it,
and has answered the question several times in my presence, and
elsewhen.


Ideas are cheap.  Breaking them to harness and putting the little
bastards to work is hard.  If you think it isn't, go ahead, steal an
idea from me and write a bestselling novel. 

Really.

Best of luck.

Joel, are you attempting to say, in your rather subtle way, that
authors don't operate in a vaccuum?  (Just in case anyone missed
the point.  This being usenet, and all, some things need to be

Utterly specious argument.  No one has ever contended that Feist ripped off
Barker's novels, but that Kelewan is (or, really, that it *was*) Tekumel.

The description of Tekumel published ca. 1975 by TSR was more complete than
any other role-playing game world that would be published for the next six
to eight years.  You should take a look at it if you intend to keep this
argument going -- there really are a *lot* of similarities. 

When Feist, et al., published their gaming material in the early eighties,
it too bore a remarkable similarity to Tekumel (the supplement I'm thinking
of had the word "Jonril" in the title somewhere I think; perhaps it was the
supplement set in a particular, well-described swamp just like the 
swamp in the south of Tsolyanu).  When I looked at those early supplements
>from  Midkemia Press, I instantly said to myself, "Hm.  A supplement for
Empire of the Petal Throne, disguised about as well as those 'generic'
fantasy supplements that are clearly designed for D&D." 

Is it Feist's contention that he was an active rpg publisher while being
totally ignorant of the very brief history (<10 yrs) of that occupation?

Just so you'll know, Barker's introduction to _Empire of the Petal Throne_
says: "Tekumel, together with its peoples, beasts, mythologies, elaborate
social systems, flora and fauna -- and especially its 'sense of wonder' --
have been with me since I was about ten years old.  These materials have
been worked and reworked as I completed my degrees in Anthropology and
Linguistics, and as I travelled to India, Pakistan, the Middle and Far East,
and to Central America.  Inspiration has been freely drawn from the works of
the fantasy 'greats,' such as R.E. Howard, Jack Vance, E.R. Burroughs, etc.,
but yet Tekumel remains very much my own creation."

So, Barker understands perfectly well that sf backgrounds don't come out of
nowhere.  He also understands the difference between an inspiration and a
rip-off, which you (whether it's out of arrogance, careerism, or the hasty
adoption of a `postmodern' aesthetic) are all too quick to efface.

Again, that's sophistry.  A simple list of similarities doesn't make
one thing the same as another.  Which was my point, one not taken by
the Barkerites, in my welcome to the fellow who wants to write Jewish
military SF to go ahead and do so.  (I think he thought he was asking
a rhetorical question.  He was -- it's just the answer was the
opposite of what he had expected.)

Well, given that it's out of print and largely forgotten, I don't know
where I'd lay a hand on it if I cared to.  But that's irrelevant.  In
any case, nobody's arguing that there aren't similarities.  I've never
heard anybody claim that there are no similarities between Kelewan and
Tekumel; I've heard Ray say, several times, that some of those
similarities came via materials others introduced into the Midkemia
via the gaming sessions.  Others, clearly, came from use of some of
the same sources, or of different sources to reach a similar end. 

For a more lengthy discussion, read the FAQ when it comes out.

Ah.  Well, then, that settles it, doesn't it?

Rather than set up straw men and socratic arguments, why not wait
until his FAQ on the subject is released?


[some quoting of Barker deleted]

>So, Barker understands perfectly well that sf backgrounds don't come out of

Again, a straw man.  Who suggested that Barker doesn't understand that
sf backgrounds come from nowhere?

He also understands the difference between an inspiration and a
>rip-off, which you (whether it's out of arrogance, careerism, or the hasty
>adoption of a `postmodern' aesthetic) are all too quick to efface. 

That's a clever way of putting it, as though those are the only two
explanations for how a bit of business gets into a novel.  Ray has
described -- and you are clearly familiar with the general outlines of
his explanation -- a third possibility, one that's rather more in line
with how writers really work.

But, basically, it's a dumbass suggestion, that either inspiration
falls from the sky to clunk you over the head, or you've evilly and
deliberately ripped off poor Dr. Barker.

As to arrogance, I'll plead guilty; I claim to know a lot more about
the process of writing novels than does a whole horde of Barkerites
with a sum of zero published novels to their credit, and will dismiss
out of hand their strongly-held opinions about how the process must
work.  As to careerism, I'll arrogantly suggest that I know rather a
lot more about how to advance my career than does an academic at Rice
University, and further suggest that the way to do it is for me to try
to write books people would want to read, something I've done with
moderate success for some ten years and some two million books now,
and that defending a friend who I believe to be unfairly smeared by a
bunch of folks acting out of proxy jealousy has nothing to do with
that.  As to a postmodern aesthetic, I'm rather anti pomo,
thankyouverymuch, as anyone familiar with my writing about writing
would attest.

Barker started writing about Tekumel when he was 10 or so, and since he's 
now retired we can only assume that he's developed his style as far as it 
will go and that it's pretty much the only style he's going to write in. He 
writes as well as he ever will. I think the blame for his lack of literary 
style can be laid on the requirements for academic writing (must be passive, 
stodgy, and obscure). Also, he hasn't been the one complaining on usenet 
about Feist. That has been his fans. While they complain, he's been 
designing his two campaigns (FYI to those who don't play RPGs: GMing is a 
LOT of work) and writing other stuff about Tekumel.

In any case, rather than defending Barker from Mr. Rosenberg's jabs at his 
(admittedly stodgy and academic) writing style I'd rather get back to the 
original point, which has been obscured by flaming and posturing from both 
sides.

Barker has been writing about Tekumel since he was 10. In 1975 TSR published 
his Empire of the Petal Throne (which is available as a reprint from Theatre 
of the Mind's Eye publishers), a very influential work in the then fledgling 
world of roleplaying games. Around 1980 Midkemia press published a number of 
roleplaying supplements about their game world, and at least one was very 
similar in style to the material in EPT. It turns out that the house 
campaign incorporated some elements from EPT. Feist and Wurtz ran with what 
they had. I've read both, and I buy new books so don't think I'm an anti-
Feist nut, or a Feist fanboy either. I don't believe that anything that 
Feist and Wurtz wrote in the "<noun> of Empire" books violated Barker's 
copyrights, but I do believe that the books, especially the first one, were 
inspired, consciously or no, by ideas presented first in EPT. The geography, 
political systems, alien races, position in a starless universe, even the 
exact number and arrangement of gods, were startlingly similar. If Mr. 
Rosenberg and Feist's many fanboy defenders would read the source material 
published by Different Worlds and Theatre of the Mind's Eye they would 
notice the similarities themselves.

So what's my point? It is that there are obvious similarities between the 
two settings, and an acknowledgement by Feist that he was inspired either 
consciously or unconsciously in the creation of Kelewan by Barker's setting 
would be appreciated. It would be good etiquette. I understand that the 
pinheads, err I mean lawyers, who represent Feist might think that any such 
admission would be a BAD idea if things were to go to a court of law, 
however as Miss Manners wrote in a recent column etiquette is what you use 
in order to keep things from getting nasty and going to a court of law, and 
if it had been followed in the first place all this acrimony would have been 
avoided.

ObCheap Dig: Not that I expect any etiquette in reply to my note, as Mr. 
Joel "spelling flame" Rosenberg hasn't shown any evidence that he can be 
polite.

Point of order: Dave Morris, the editor of EPT fanzine "The Eye Of
All-Seeing Wonder", is a professional fiction writer. In 1990(*) he
sold more books in the UK than any other writer. Not any other
British writer, any other writer period.

Jamie Thompson, who plays in the EPT game group which regularly
convenes at Dave's house, is also a professional writer: I'd
estimate he has about twenty books to his name, but that's just a
guess. Oliver Johnson, also of the Thursday Night Game, is an
editor at Corgi, and has written a bunch of books -- again, I
don't know how many exactly. I've dropped out of that group, but
I have six books to my credit. Paul Mason, late of that group (now
living in Japan, but still a staunch Barkerite, as the article
he's just submitted to my quasi-academic journal shows), has
authored at least three, possibly four. Oh, and Min's written some
as well. As far as I know, none of the others have, but doubtless
Dermot will put me right on this.

One EPT group. Just one.

I'll thank you to have the good grace to apologise for your
arrogance.

(*)Could have been 1989. I'm not sure offhand.

Enough is enough you guys.

If you want to carry on this argument ad infinitum, do it privately.
Personally, I'll wait till it comes out on video.

I really dont care who ripped off who.  I have read the books and played
the game, and neither of them are holy enough to get so upset about.  

Can we get back to Tekumel now ?   I was under the impression that this
group was about that.

So I understand.  This is perhaps unfortunate.  A friend of mine who
kept repeatedly rewriting a novel set against a background he had
invented at age 14 eventually gave it up as a bad idea, as I think he
was wise to.

>now retired we can only assume that he's developed his style as far as it

Well, I suppose that's up to him.  Jack Williamson, who has been
writing professionally about as long as Barker has been alive, is
still developing his craft.  (I think that's one of the things that
keeps him young.)

 He 
>writes as well as he ever will. I think the blame for his lack of literary

That's true enough, so I'm told.  But I think we can all list some
rather good fiction writers who are also academics who have been able
to set that aside when writing fiction -- or nonfiction, for that
matter.  Stephen Hawking, f'rinstance.

>Also, he hasn't been the one complaining on usenet 
>about Feist. 

No, not on Usenet, true enough.  But I hope you're not suggesting that
he hasn't been constantly complaining about Ray -- or does he just do
it when I'm around?  That's not what his friends report, but perhaps
you know better?  From here, it appears to be a matter of ongoing
importance for him.

>That has been his fans. While they complain, he's been 
>designing his two campaigns (FYI to those who don't play RPGs: GMing is a

Well, good.  That puts paid to the comment, attributed to him, that
this whole thing has prevented him from writing.

Well, good. 

>but I do believe that the books, especially the first one, were

That's interesting.  Which ideas were presented first in EPT?  My
understanding is that even Barker admits that he drew his ideas from
many sources.  Of the ideas that seem to have come to Ray from EPT via
the Midkemia gaming sessions, none of them seem to have been presented
first in EPT, but seem to have predated it by years, at least, and in
some cases, millenia.  Laminated boiled-leather armor, multiple
spacial continuaa, insectoid aliens, ancient empires with isolated
rulers, pantheons of gods, geographical names based on real-world
geographical names -- all of these sound very familiar to me, and I
think use of most of all of them predates Barker by rather a lot.

Well, I was sort of wondering about that myself, given that nobody's
denied that there are similarities, and that some of them came to
Ray's books via the Midkemia gaming sessions.

>It is that there are obvious similarities between the 
>two settings, 

Something I've never heard denied, although I can think of few
postings in support of Barker that have failed to make it as an
assertion.  Kind of puzzling, really; since nobody's disputing that,
why keep asserting it?

>and an acknowledgement by Feist that he was inspired either 
>consciously or unconsciously in the creation of Kelewan by Barker's setting 
>would be appreciated. 

I've heard Ray say, quite clearly and openly on several occasions,
that some similarities in the two came unintentionally to him via the
Midkemia gaming sessions.  Shall I relay your appreciation?  Or do you
want to wait for the release of his FAQ?

>It would be good etiquette. I understand that the 
>pinheads, err I mean lawyers, who represent Feist might think that any such 
>admission would be a BAD idea if things were to go to a court of law, 

Miss Manners would probably wonder how you would know what, if any,
advice Ray got from his lawyers, and how you would know that it's
plural, rather than singular, if indeed it is.  (I don't, myself, but
clearly this matter is something that you know more about than I do.)

>however as Miss Manners wrote in a recent column etiquette is what you use 
>in order to keep things from getting nasty and going to a court of law, and 
>if it had been followed in the first place all this acrimony would have been 
>avoided.

Certainly that's possible.  From reading an early draft of Ray's FAQ on
the matter, it's pretty clear to me that if Barker had initially made
a polite inquiry as to whether and how, if at all, similarities in
Ray's work had derived from Barker's gaming, it's likely that the
second or third novel would have had a tip-of-the-hat in his
direction.

But, as you ought to know, that wasn't Barker's response.  I'm sure
anybody would agree that one doesn't open hostilities with shouts
about lawsuits and then expect things to be handled in an entirely
friendly and informal manner thereafter.



>ObCheap Dig: Not that I expect any etiquette in reply to my note, as Mr. 
>Joel "spelling flame" Rosenberg hasn't shown any evidence that he can be

I beg your pardon.  Do please pass a crumpet, dear.  (And do you
always consider a simple correction when one's name is misspelled to
be a "spelling flame"?  How very unfortunate for you, dear.)

Fascinating.  One thing that's amazed me over the years is how
incredibly different the US and UK markets are; another is how large
the field has gotten.  Could you list some of his better-known novels,
please?  Have they found US publishers?  (I used to try to keep up
with the field in the US, but with about a thousand new novels each
year, that's long since become impossible.)

I wish you'd have listed some.  I know it's not your point, but here
you're listing four or five or six writers with upwards of thirty
novels and clearly millions upon millions of copies to their credit,
and I've never heard of any of them.

Well, I could do that, I guess; or I could say that the credits of
these gentlemen were unfamiliar to me.

But I won't, although that's true.

On the other hand, since I was quite clearly defining a class -- the
horde of Barkerites with a sum of zero novels to their credit -- I'll
not apologize for your undoubtedly well-meant attempt to cram this
shoe on the foot of somebody (several somebodies, yourself included)
not in the class and claim it doesn't fit.  Point of fact -- as
anybody who knows me can attest -- I'm always interested in the
opinions of other professional writers as to how the business works.
Matter of fact, I'm almost always interested in the opinions of a
professional in any field as to how their profession works.

Best,

I almost wish that were possible, really I do.

But imagine this analogy.  You bumped into me on the street ten years
ago.  Literally bumped into me.  Not hard, mind; you didn't break any
of my bones, or knock me off my feet or knock any packages from my
hands, or even hurt me, but if you'd been watching better where you
were going, it wouldn't have happened.

Possible, no?

Now, certainly we could argue that this sort of thing happens all the
time -- I've certainly bumped into somebody, and suspect you have --
and it's the sort of thing you leave yourself open to happening when
you go out in public.  But I expect that the moment you noticed, you
would have muttered a quick apology and then dropped the matter.

Which would have been fair enough.  No harm done.

But imagine if my response, before you were even fully aware you had
bumped into me, was to shout about how you had assaulted me and how I
ought to sue, and imagine that I'd kept up -- directly and via my
circle of friends -- complaining about the time you "assaulted" me for
years.  Friends of yours might explain that yes, there are some

No, but you are acting as an apologist for gross intellectual 
dishonesty.  Look, whether or not Barker is as good a writer
as Feist is immaterial.  Whether or not critics of either are
good or published writers is also immaterial.

One doesn't have to be a novelist to recognize work that 
copies plainly from the work of another.  It happens in 
all fields, not just novel-writing. If a highly derivative 
work does not openly acknowledge the source of its ideas, 
then the author of the derivative work is being 
intellectually dishonest.

For one person to copy from another's work and then reply to 
criticism of that action with the claim that "Well, it
didn't happen.  But if it did, it's still OK, because the
first guy sucked anyway and doesn't **deserve** credit for his
ideas," compounds dishonesty with terrible hubris.

Mr. Feist, or you or I for that matter, has no more right to
write in the Tekumel world (however thinly veiled) without
attribution than he does to write in the world of Darkover or
the universe of Star Trek -- even were he to use the names
Darkunder or Star Walk.

writes in and says...

>On the other hand, you have an incredibly narrow view of what constitutes a

>the SFWA. 

Well, no.  SFWA does NOT define what a professional writer is, and if
you were in a position to become an active member of SFWA, you would
probably be in a position to know that, and to know that an attempt to
restrict active SFWA membership to professional writers went aground
not too long ago.

SFWA membership requires selling three short stories; I don't think
somebody with that small amount of professional credentials is a
professional writer.  I think it's silly to assert that, to pick an
example, a shoe salesman in LA who's sold half a dozen short stories
in a dozen years is a professional writer.  Even if they're terrific
stories.

Then again, I don't think there's anything wrong with being an amateur
writer.  Not like being an amateur neurosurgeon, after all.

> You don't seem to include, for example, Barker. 

Certainly not.  He's a (retired) professional academic, with a hobby
of fiction writing which he seems to have given up (at least, that's
what he's said).  Nothing wrong with a hobby, mind; I have several.  

> Nor, to give

You're quite right.  I don't think you're a professional science
fiction writer any more than I'm a professional bridge player.

Yeah.  And?  

> If

I don't.  I don't include as income money you've gotten other people
to give to a charity, and am surprised you would.  I also don't
include the income of people you've hung around with as income you've
gotten as a professional writer, not income you've made doing other
things, nor income you migh t have made doing other things, nor . . .

>easily have made more than someone with only four or five novels to their

>hours, I suspect I've made more than you.  

Possibly; I wouldn't know how much you've raised for charity, and
wouldn't think that has much to do with anything except how much that
charity's made.

> I respect your skill and craft;

I'm not a professional writer because I have more skill and craft than
a given amateur; I may or may not.  I'm a professional writer because
writing is what I do for a living.  It's my job.

>do you respect mine?

As what?  As an amateur radio jock with some serious length of
service?  Sure.  As a professional science fiction/fantasy writer?
Well, no, since I don't think you are one, and I find it silly for you
to suggest you are.  Sorry.  I think there are gray areas -- Harry
Stubbs, for example (he would say he's an amateur; I'd call him a
professional) -- but I don't think that you come close, and find it
silly for you to suggest that you are.

Sorry.

>But imagine this analogy
[stupid analogy omitted]

The problem with your analogy is that Barker has never said a thing about
any of this.  I challenge you to quote ANYTHING Barker has ever written on
the matter, or quote any word he's ever said about it.

So far all I see is you saying "directly and via [his] circle of friends".

I doubt most of the people on here are Barker's friends, and I doubt you
have anything to back up 'directly' at all.  You hold everyone to trivial
points of logic and dismiss their arguments based on any trivial matter
you can find or invent, yet you yourself are using fallacious logic,
loaded language (like labelling anyone who opposes you a "Barkerite
fanboy" regardless of whether or not they actually like Barker's work,
and regardless of whether or not they are a boy).  

The fact is you simply have to have the last word in any argument, regardless
of topic, regardless of tactic, regardless of reason.

As one example, you continue to talk about this "upcoming FAQ".  Well, until
you can actually present it, your mentioning it is a waste of time.  I 
challenge you to produce it, and until you do, shut up about it.  Why should
I believe you that it exists?

Never mind of course that the existence of such a FAQ undermines your entire
position.  Either a) there are so many "Barkerite fanboys" that his work 
must have enough quality to justify this discussion, or b) not everyone 
questioning Feists plagiarism (for that's what it is) is a "Barkerite
fanboy", and therefore objective persons are indeed skeptical.

If so many people are bringing up the issue that it needs a FAQ, then enough
people disagree with you that your questionable "I'm a famous author and
therefore know better than you" argument is moot.  Whether or not you've
published 2 million novels does NOT make you an expert on plagiarism.

Milli Vanilli sold more than 2 million albums all the while fully aware 
that they were not the actual vocalists.  Feist is probably laughing all
the way to the bank, fully aware that he has succeeded in plagiarizing
another author.

Finally, although you probably weren't around for it, this thread was 
started when someone ASKED about the similarities between Feist's and
Barker's works.  This is NOT the same as the picture you paint of
"Barkerite fanboys" incessantly complaining.  The only reason this
conversation has gone on so long is not because of complaining 
Barkerite fanboys.  It's because of one single Feist Fanboy who has
the gall to insult every reader on the net by denying the obvious fact
that Feist plagiarized Barker's work and has made a fortune off it for
more than ten years.

This won't stop you from replying in your condescending manner.
Nothing can stop that.  But your arguments are empty shells of emotion
and gall.  Why don't you go back to writing your novels?

He has said, in my presence, "I write bestselling novels under the
name Raymond E. Feist" and, somewhat later in the conversation, "he
[Feist] stole most of [either his world or Kelewan, I forget] from my
Tekumel."  Friends of his -- Dave Romm and Victor Raymond, to name
two, have quoted him to me as saying much the same.

Next?

I've kept out of this incarnation of this discssion so far (I wasted enough
time one or two rounds ago), but this provokes me to respond. This socalled
fact may be obvious to you, but don't speak of it as it was a natural law.
At least one other person (me) thinks that while many details of Kelewan
does indeed seem to derive from EPT, none of them are either original 
Barker ideas, nor crucial to the "Empire" stories. Furthermore, Feist (or 
the GM who originally used EPT as a basis for Kelewan) introduced enough 
differences to make the "feel" of the two worlds completely different. I've
read both Feist and Barker and I have a copy of the original EPT and I
didn't notice the similarities until they were pointed out to me. As far as 
I'm concerned you're accusing Feist of plagiarizing because SOME of the 
building blocks he uses are the same even though the edifice he builds is 
quite different.

Nicely put. 

In fact, "plagiarize" does have a precise legal definition, and it
ain't "to write books of one's own creation that have been in some
ways indirectly influenced by the writings of another, even if that
pisses theother off."

Plagiarism is, in fact, the sort of thing that gets sued over, and if
the guilty party is a bestselling writer -- Alex Haley springs to
mind; he apparently quite unintentionally lifted some scenes from
somebody else -- the settlements can be very large, to avoid putting
it in front of a fair jury, where a plagiarist would likely get
clobbered.

Plagiarism is not the sort of thing that an author forgives, as
Dr. Barker has been quoted by his friends as saying he would have, in
return for a simple mention on an ack page.

There have been cases of plagiarism in the field.  Somebody sold the
same Garner Fox novel to two publishers at once some years back, and
absconded with the checks.  (And, as far as I know, has never been
caught.)  Craig Strete's career as a freelance writer -- and perhaps
as an academic, as well -- has been ruined by the accusations that his
Death in the Spirit House was plagiarized from Ron Montana's
manuscript.  Far as I can tell, Bantam met all of Montana's demands,
rather than have things go to suit and trial.

Hm.  Probably Terry Brooks' pillage of _LotR_ is not, legally, considered
plagiarism eh?  Nonetheless it is artistically and ethically despicable,
wouldn't you say?

Tangential, I know, but perhaps relevant.

Hm.  If I said that I was attempting to write a novel as much like _The 
Brothers Karamazov_ as possible, I would mean that I was attempting to 
duplicate the style, the scope, and perhaps the themes.  I would not mean 
characters and fucking *plot*!!  But perhaps that is just me.

Now it seems that Feist has borrowed some setting elements from Barker.  (I 
say "it appears".  My only knowledge of this subject comes from reading this 
thread.)  This seems to be the kind of thing which is ubiquitous in literature 
(and especially speculative literature) starting with Homer and never letting 
up.  Hardly cause for an outcry.  ?   By bringing Terry Brooks in I am 
pointing to a rather more aggravated case, in which character, plot, and (if 
only de facto) theme are copied wholesale.  These elements are essential to 
a story and it could be argued that someone who copies these elements without
any "value adding" can be said to be selling a story that he didn't write!
Surely no-one would say this of Feist. ?

I trust that you intend to create a book such that a person who has read
_St. Martin's Summer_ will still gain something more from reading _Not
Exactly_ than from re-reading _St. Martin's_.

	Similar things have been said about a number of "classics", 
up to and including strong cases made for Shakespeare doing just that (i.e.,
taking characters, plots, and everything else and making his own copy
of the story -- his wording, but everything else from another source. I
believe that _Hamlet_ was one of the works supposedly made this way.)

	Now, I don't think Terry Brooks is today's Shakespeare, and I
don't think HE does, either. However, I, at least, got a good deal out
of _The Sword of Shannara_, and its sequels, which I didn't out of
_Lord of the Rings_. Overall, yes, I think that LotR is by far the 
"solider" work, if you'll excuse the mangled word. I'm not surprised
by this, since LotR was the end result of much of Professor Tolkien's
lifework. 

	Nonetheless, I think Brooks fulfilled his obligation to add something
new to his story which was not in the original. I've seen an analysis of
the story which attempted to show that there was NO essential difference
between the two stories; some time ago, however, I posted an analysis
here which demonstrated the differences -- some quite extreme. The oft-
repeated bit about Allanon=Gandalf, especially, is a canard. Other than
the fact that both of them are examples of the Wise Old Man archetype --
found in literature and mythology the world round and throughout history --
there is really very, very little that the two have in common. Similar
contrasts hold for the other "parallel" characters; yes, one can trace
some relationship between them and their (admitted) inspirational models,
but in the end analysis they are something quite different from their
opposite numbers.

>Now it seems that Feist has borrowed some setting elements from Barker.  (I 
>say "it appears".  My only knowledge of this subject comes from reading this

	Feist played in Barker's FRP campaign. Some elements of the 
campaign inspired him. I have, right here, a story written by a former
player in my campaign which was inspired by the campaign. I understand
>from  him that it is, at present, making the rounds of the publishing
companies hoping for a shot. Having read it, I could say the following:
	1) It certainly couldn't have been written without me, since
the main character was created in my world, many of the events and 
the general "approach" of the world stemmed directly from the game I
ran, and one country and its major inhabitants were created BY me,
specifically for that character's background.
	 2) it ALSO certainly couldn't have been written BY me, either.
The approach, dialogue, and description are very different from 
my own. Given that, if it's ever published, I would consider it a 
COMPLIMENT -- not stealing or anything of the kind -- as long as
he acknowledges me, somewhere, somehow.

	You could tell the same story a dozen times and still fascinate
the audience if you're a great storyteller. If you have a dozen different
writers and just the elements of the story, you'll likely still get
a dozen different books -- with strong similarities, but still not at
all the same.

Well, it's not my cup of tea.  But then a lot isn't my cup of tea.
But no, while I don't care for it, I don't think it's either.  

But it does raise an important point -- Brooks' success hasn't hurt
the sale or reputation of LoTR one whit.  JRRT's work, with its
virtues and flaws, stands fine all by itself.  The thing speaks for
itself -- anybody remember the latin for that?

On the other hand, I've never heard of Guy Kay (who I know only
casually, although we come from the same hometown) or of Christopher
Tolkein (who I'm related to, quite distantly, by his marriage, even
though I can't spell his name reliably right) fuming over the resemblance.

>Tangential, I know, but perhaps relevant.


Well, no.  Brooks set out to write something as much like LoTR as he
could; he's been upfront about that in interviews always.  He thinks,
he's said, that JRRT wrote the ideal fantasy book, and his attempt was
to duplicate the feat as exactly as possible.  (Whether or not he
succeeded is another issue -- something you'll have to discuss with
somebody who was actually able to get through one or more of his
books, not me -- and whether or not it was something worth doing is
yet another.)  

Ray set out to tell a story that was his own, using zillions of
different influences and sources..  Whole different thing.

Me, my next Guardians book, the one under contract to TOR, takes its
plot quite directly from Sabatini's St. Martin's Summer (I love
Sabatini in general and that book in particular), although the working
title (and perhaps the final title; I dunno yet) is Not Exactly The
Three Musketeers.  

Should I worry about hordes of Sabatini fans baying outside my windows
at night?

Nah.  We Sabatini fans (I'm certainly one) know that his
accomplishments are in his paper and ink; all you have to do is look.

I would be very intersted in your analysis of this.  As I recall Allanon
and Gandalf share the exact same portion of the plot.  Specificly, the
character appears to the protagonists under an air of great mystery, imparts
that there are Great and Terrible Things afoot, tells them "I'll be
back soon" and then vanishes for long enough to make them worry.
Later (after almost identcal plot happenings) the protagonists meet another
mysterious man who claims an alliance with the character.  They meet up with
the character again and he explains in more detail about the quest they
must undertake, declaring that he will lead the quest.  The protagonists
get separated from the character and the other questors, after which the
character will apparently die, only to re-appear later.  He will give up
on guiding the protagonists entirely, and will concentrate on aiding the good
guys in the war.
  I'm sure I could do a better job of this if I had read _Sword O Shannara_ 
more recently than 9th grade...  Could you, noble Sea Wasp, please give 
me a similar sketch of the alleged differences between Allanon and Gandalf?
Thanks.

BTW, I think Gandalf->Allanon is the weakest of the primary character links.
Frodo->Shea, Sam->Flick and Aragorn->Balinor seem even more precisely
matched to me.

Sure: sounds interesting to me.

Other than that, sorry; I don't know Harlan Ellison, although we do
have mutual friends -- including Ray Feist, by the way -- I'm not
familiar with Ellison's claim, with the work that he might have
claimed Terminator was derived from, with whether or not there was a
settlement, although I did see an ack in the credits.

Having just read a whole week's worth of this Barker/Feist flamewar, I sort of 
feel that popping my head up at this point will get it removed by a hail of 
bullets, but here goes...

I've read both Feist and Barker. I enjoyed Feist for the story. I enjoyed 
Barker for the fascinating world he'd created. When I first read _Magician_ and 
someone asked me what it was like, I described it as "_Lord of the Rings_ meets 
_Shogun_." 

Therein, IMO, lies the difference between Barker and Feist. Barker based his 
world and story on years of research into other cultures, histories and 
religions (as did Tolkien); Feist based his world and story on some other 
people's ideas - Barker's and Tolkien's. If the estate of Tolkien had $1 for 
every fantasy novel with his conception of elves and dwarves in it, they'd be 
the biggest growth industry in the UK. Feist can tell a good story. (He doesn't 
*always*, but he can.) Barker I enjoy, in spite of his writing style. But the 
ideas and concepts he has created from all that research are more original than 
anything Feist has ever done or ever will do (IMHO. His books seem to be 
getting more formulaic, rather than less). Feist can put new twists on old 
concepts, like most good modern fantasy, but there are only a handful of 
writers who can come up with a convincing *new* fantasy world. 

Of course, there's nothing new under the sun. But anything with humans in is 
going to reflect real human cultures, past and present. (And alien cultures 
will too, probably, but that's another thread entirely...) In the field of 
fantasy, there are a few innovators and a lot of imitators. A lot of the 
imitators sell better than the innovators because the reading public says "this 
is new and strange, I'd rather have the old stuff. I feel more at home there." 
As an example, I'll suggest a few innovators. Robert E. Howard's Conan. Ursula 
K. Le Guin's Earthsea. Moorcock's Elric (though he cites Howard, Dunsany and 
Poul Anderson, I think he's just being modest). Andre Norton's Witch World. 
Tolkien's Middle-Earth (of course). Poul Anderson's The Broken Sword and Three 
Hearts and Three Lions. And I'd put M.A.R. Barker in with them. There are no 
doubt more - this is a game we could all play, though I think it should be 
moved to a different thread. 

Most readers of fantasy would rather have another book with elves and dwarves 
in, and a reasonable facsimile of Tolkien's elven languages, than something 
with strange new cultures and words they don't know how to pronounce. 
Personally, I admire authors more for their creativity, inventiveness and 
dedication to their chosen forte, than their ability to make money. I suspect 
Joel Rosenberg doesn't.

Depends what you mean by "gain something more", I guess.  If we can

I know I'm letting my self in for it by posting this, but...

I liked Mr. Feist's books.  And he was very nice to me when I posted 
several questions to him on AOL.  I never heard of Mr. Barker until I 
read these posts.  And I love a good argument, so I've been "lurking" 
here for a while now.  But my question to all of you is:

Don't you think that your time would be better spent admiring the work of 
the author(s) you enjoy?  Perhaps your comments about the books  
would be most appreciated by the authors.
  
But if you don't think so, well, I'm having a great time "listening" to 
your arguments!

OBQuibble: Tolkien didn't invent elves and dwarves, or even that particular
"conception" of them- the ideas he used are centuries old. I understand
your point (it's easier to churn out novels with "elves and dwarves" by 
copying a few bits of LotR than by going to source material)- but not every
person using elves and dwarves in that manner is a rip-off artist.

But this is an old flamewar, and matters little to this discussion. 

 Feist can tell a good story. (He doesn't

Tastes Vary. Ideas and Concepts are all well and good, but absent some 
degree of storytelling ability, Ideas and Concepts don't get any of my beer
money. If I can get quality storytelling, plus good, original worldbuilding,
I'll happily pay hardcover prices for it. But I'll pay for a good re-telling
of an old story before I pay for an "original" world described in poor
style.

>Of course, there's nothing new under the sun.

Not even that phrase...

{much text, several examples deleted}

>Most readers of fantasy would rather have another book with elves and dwarves 
>in, and a reasonable facsimile of Tolkien's elven languages, than something 
>with strange new cultures and words they don't know how to pronounce. 

I disagree with this. I can't claim to speak for (or about, really) "most
readers"- but at least in my experience, I'm more than willing to read
about "strange new cultures, and words [I] don't know how to pronounce}-
_provided the stories are told well._ That combination is pretty hard to
come by.

But in the absence of that combination of storytelling talent and good
worldbuilding, I tend to weight storytelling a good bit more highly than you
seem to. I'll take books with good characters and a well-told story, but a
world that is sketchily described at best (some of Peter Beagle's stuff, for
example) over books with a lovingly detailed world, original in every detail,
which serves as a stage for rather wooden characters, and pedantic writing.
Tastes Vary- these are mine, and I know a good number of people with similar
taste in fantasy literature.

(Note: this is not a specific attack on Barker, or anyone else (hence the 
lack of an example, lest I trigger another screaming flamewar) I've never
actually read anything by Barker, nor heard of him before this discussion.)

>Personally, I admire authors more for their creativity, inventiveness and

I'll leave that last to him, having filled my yearly quota for screaming
irrational flamewars.

My position, as I've stated above, is to go with "storytelling talent" as
the main criterion for authors I admire. It's possible to be dedicated, and
still be awful (as anyone witnessing my golf game can testify), and I'm
arrogant enough to think that, given more free time, I could be as inventive
as most anyone out there. It's the storytelling thing that gets me- there
are a lot of books out there that I read and say "Aw, I could do that"- 
there are relatively few that make me say "Wow- I could never write that 
well." Those are the people I respect.

To lift a scene from the movie _Wolf_:
"Your book changed my life."
"Let me guess. After reading it, you decided to realize your life-long
dream of becoming a writer..."
"No, after reading it, I gave up writing entirely, because I knew I could
never be _that_ good..."

What's the status of the various TOME Tekumel products which are
supposedly in the works? I'm particularly interested in "Mitlanyal"
and v.3 of the S&G sourcebook (I hate squinting at the tiny type and
ugly diacritics in my old Gamescience version).

Sorry if this has been asked recently.

Wear your helmet, and hope we're over 300 yards away....  Actually, I
think your suspicion is right, but I'm trying not to be one of the
shooters.  I'm more interested in the various interesting points that
have come up around this discussion than in the blood, gore, and guts.

While I think we're going to disagree, I think this paragraph is a
valuable contribution to a valuable discussion (which is quite
tangential to the main flamefest, thank goodness).

You gloss over the mechanism by which the creations of an innovator,
such as Tolkien, become the accepted mainstream and widely immitated.
Tolkien himself was immensely successful, as were LeGuin and Moorcock
and Howard.  Hmmm.  Seems to me like the innovators on your list have
a pretty high success percentage themselves.  Just to start with, most
of them are in print, except for Barker.  But I think you're pointing
right at the dead heart of popular culture, the place where a movie
executive or a publisher says "We need something fresh and new" and
then rejects everything presented as not enough like some other recent
success.

I'll disagree strongly on Moorcock's Elric; I think the sources he
cites cover essentially everything.  You'd get further with something
like _Gloriana_ -- I didn't like it, but it's not much like anything
else; it's original.

All your other innovators had characters as well as a world, which may
also be relevant to their differential success relative to Barker.

>Most readers of fantasy would rather have another book with elves and dwarves 
>in, and a reasonable facsimile of Tolkien's elven languages, than something 
>with strange new cultures and words they don't know how to pronounce. 

Tolkien *was* strange new cultures and words they didn't know how to
pronounce, and he became tremendously successful.  For that matter,
James Clavell's _Shogun_ was a *tremendous* success, and it was full
of strange culture (at least three, Japanese, English, and Portugese,
all of a long time ago) and strange words (Latin and Japanese in
abundunce, and bits of other things).  

I don't think people avoid novelty; I think most people seek it.  But
they look for other qualities as well.  Tolkien and Clavell both told
a wonderful story, with well-chosen and arranged words, about
characters who were interesting and became important to the readers.
I think they succeeded primarily as *writers*, rather than as
world-creators (Clavell, of course, was mostly depicting historical
cultures rather than creating a world).

Volume 3:  done, at the printers.  On the shelves soon.

New Rules:  done, at TOME getting art.  They're TRYING to get it out for
GenCon, but may have to settle for having Volume 3 there.

Mitlanyal: Almost done.  I'm currently transcribing taped interviews 
on the temples of Hru'u and Belkhanu.  The Hru'u interview is three 
hours in length, but is also the only source I've got on Hru'u, so 
there's nothing for it but to slog through.  Belkhanu is shorter and
more is written on Belkhanu, so that shouldn't be so bad.

Following that, I have to integrate the Livyani material out of the
third novel (which, I'm happy to report, Phil is working on again),
which is also necessary as there is very little printed information
on Livyanu.

However, once that is finished...  I'm done.  Then I sit down with
Phil and we flesh out some of the information on tsolyani cohorts 
or whatever that seems lacking.  The goal is to have this on the shelves
for Christmas.

Well, as one of those mutual friends...:-)

What I understand is that normally there might not have been much of
a case, particularly since, at least to my eyes, there's not that much
similarity between Soldier and the other Harlan scripted Outer Limits
episode in question (whose name slips my mind) and Terminator. 
Some, but not enough that I'd go "Whoa, that was a ripoff". 

However, I've heard that Cameron made the mistake of stating in a 
semi-public area that he'd ripped off said episodes for Terminator.
In other words, there was at least one witness that there'd been intent.
Tie this in with Harlan and Ben Bova having previously won an idea
infraction suit for their story Brillo vis a vis the tv show Future Cop
(much stronger evidence there, including their having pitched the idea
to some of the same people), and, frankly, Harlan's rep as someone who
likely wouldn't just go away, and I at least could see why a settlement
might start looking good to the parties in question.

Nice to have a reasonable, civilised disagreement on this thread!

I'm basing my "most readers" on seven years experience working in a specialist 
SF & Fantasy bookshop. Our top fantasy sellers are Dragonlance (etc., etc.) 
books. Then comes David Eddings & Terry Brooks. The "original" stuff is way 
down the list in sales terms. Personally, I like the "strange new cultures" 
stuff myself. 

Actually, the above is slightly misleading. Our *biggest* seller by a looooong 
way is Terry Pratchett. But then a lot of people read TP who say "I don't 
normally read books, but..." 

BTW I don't entirely disagree with you on good stories vs originality and well 
told. But I'd rather have a bad story in an interesting background than a bad 
story in an indifferent/familiar background. IMHO.

P.S. We stock US books as well as UK, and our top-selling SF books are 
undoubtedly Star-Trek novels.

Well, if you want to measure things in sales terms....
That was the primary reason for the disclaimer in my original posting- I
assume that there is _some_ reason for the piles of Dragonlance novels
which get in the way of the books I'm looking for. (Though, at home, the 
specialty bookstore that I hit at least has the decency to weight these
books no more heavily than anything else in the store- i.e. one copy of 
each book in a given series (maybe two), leaving room for more stuff by 
less... infamous authors. But I digress...)

What it comes down to, basically, is not so much a lack of desire for new
things, as it is a matter of laziness on all parts. It's easier to set out
to tell a story in a relatively familiar setting than it is to create a 
new world. It's easier to settle down and read such a story than it is to
try to find the three or four good, "original" stories that lurk in the
dark recesses of the sf section of the local library/ bookstore. And so
forth.

I think that, barring the occasional truly experimental story/ world/
whatever (those few that are different enough to be truly shocking),
most sf/ fantasy readers would be entirely willing to have "new and 
original" worlds, stories, and cultures presented to them. But it's rare
to find people willing to go to the effort to do this well, and rare to
find people willing to hunt these authors down and publicize them.

{If it'll help, you can amend "most...readers" to "most readers with whom I
have regular dealings" or even "most...readers, not counting those who only
buy TSR spin-off novels..."} 

Note that this is not a problem unique to the genre. You can hear this
complaint regarding all areas of Art (tm) (If I may be permitted the brief
conceit of calling SF/ Fantasy Art (tm)...)- music, painting, movies,
"mainstream" literature, etc. There's not a whole lot of originality in
the world, in any guise.

>BTW I don't entirely disagree with you on good stories vs originality and well 
>told. But I'd rather have a bad story in an interesting background than a bad

>
<shrug>
Tastes Vary (tm). But given the choice of two bad stories, one in a 
familiar background, and one in a new (or even interesting) background, I
have a stack of paperbacks in my room that I'll go and re-read....

But I'll take a good story in a bad background over a bad story in a good
background any day.

Later,
OilCan

Well it didn't change, it stayed the same.  That was part of the challenge.

What INITIALLY happened, historically, was that a Hnalla candidate was
announced, Thri'il was besieged, and the candidate disappeared, presumed
killed or captured in the invasion.

What NEXT happened was that instead of being announced, the candidate was
atomized by a spell during the presentation.  This resulted in the
destruction of Avanthar and a looped side-plane which returned to the
initial state.

What FINALLY happened is that the candidate was NOT announced, but was
also not killed, and disappeared during the invasion.

The net difference is that rather than an ANNOUNCED candidate missing,
an unknown individual is missing.  Considering how few individuals at
the presentation actually survived the invasion and seige, the number
of individuals affected by this change is small.  A few people exist
who were originally aware of who the candidate was, but who are now
unaware of who the candidate was.

It is currently the 13th or so of Trantor, 2366.

Mirusiya has returned to Fasiltum following a daring, surprisingly successful,
but ultimately doomed attempt on the Golden Tower.  A small force managed
to sweep up on Avanthar, fight their way in, and were held off at the
base of the tower itself, by which time their reduced numbers required them
to withdraw.  Upon returning home Mirusiya had some kind of falling-out with
one or more of his close advisors and with Elara, his consort, which has
been to some degree patched up.

Rereshqala, Eselne, Taksuru (the new Ksarul prince) and Mirusiya had agreed
upon a Kolumejalim, but Eselne has started to make some noise about his
being older than Taksuru and Mirusiya and deserving some kind of special
conditions for the contests.  Hopefully these issues can be ironed out, but
no date for the contests has been fixed.

Reports say that Ma'in has fallen out with Rereshqala, taking prisoner his
pregnant consort, Sogai hiTsanune.

Aremala is uninterested in politics and continues to sculpt in Tumissa.

Mridobu has not been heard from since the seige of Bey Su was abated
by Eselne's forces and the distractions caused by Mirusiya's raid.

A new candidate was supposedly to be announced in Sokatis, but the temple
of Sarku in that city disrupted the ceremony with an undignified little
darkness spell and the ceremonies were cancelled.  The next attempt was
interrupted by either Hru'u, Dlamelish, or both, and featured the
Hnalla contingent engaging in frenzied copulation in the middle of the
goings-on.  The OAL determined a keg of wine, "spiked" with aphrodesiac,
to be the cause.

Based on these events, people are guessing that the new candidate might
be a Stability worshipper.  These Tsolyani are pretty sharp!
A few geniuses even surmise that this is the same candidate as was
supposed to be revealed in Thri'il two years ago.  However, something
keeps happening to prevent the revelation...

And that's the News from Tekumel!

Nothing has been heard from Ald or Fu Shi'i since they withdrew from alliance
with Dhichune and returned home to settle the northern warlords.

Summary: Advertisement




The following is a Shamless Plug for my new line of 15mm Tekumel miniatures.
If you are not interested in a commercial advertisement, stop reading now.

I am still awaiting the "MAR Barker Seal of Approval" for the entire line,
but he has seen the Tsolyani and the nonhumans and was very complementary.
Prof. Barker will be shipped some samples of the Yan Koryani this week, but
I expect no problems.

Prof. Barker has expressed a need for some Tsolyani heavy spear or pike, as
well as the Mighty of Yan Kor. As soon as the Shen and Hlaka are finished,
those two will be next (likely Legion of the Mighty Prince, just because they
look so neat).

These are the mail order prices and packaging conventions. They will likely be
more costly if they ever make it to retailers. The nonhumans, particularly
the Ahoggya and Hlaka, are considerably more expensive beause of the additional
labor involved in casting and packaging (fewer figures per spin because they're
larger, and multiple pieces in the case of the Hlaka and Ahoggya).

Any additional thoughts, comments, or critiques are invited. Suggestions on
where to take the line are certainly welcome.

An obvious way to prioritize releases is to take a look at who is involved in 
fighting the Tsolyani right now:

Yan Kor:	After the generics come out, some specialty figs like the 
		Fishers of the Flame and/or the Mad Ones of Hlikku would be
		nice.

Mu'uglavya:	They're overunning the chakas right now, could be useful.

Milumaniyanni:	Come on, who wouldn't want to face the Mighty of Sunraya IV?

Salarvyani: 	A nice thought, but can be saved for later.

I think Mug-uglies would be the next priority.  Also some Sarku undead could
be useful, as Dhichune seems to be recycling his troops.  Some more generic
skirmishers would be nice as well.

Just my two kaitars...

Mirusiya for emporer! 
Pave the World! (Or at least Saa Allaqi...)
The Bringers of the Flame:
Givers Of Sorrow!Red Devastation!Searing Flame!Potent Destiny!Bolt Of Flame

Red Hats would make good foes, and we've never seen Livyani or Salarvyani
figures (perhaps for the obvious reason that they don't sell so good?).
IMHO, I'd like to see some Sarku troops (Scales of Brown and Seal of the
Worm) and some Mrur troops with them, followed with some of the Mu'ugs
currently ruining the Chakas.  I'm also fond of non-humans: after the
Shen and Pe Choi, how about some Pachi Lei, Ssu, Hluss?  Oh, yeah: we
could use some N'luss figures too, although 15mm vikings might do the
job...

A demonological question:

In _The Book of Ebon Bindings_ we learn that various demons have "the
essence of Lord X and the substance of Lord Y". Nowhere in the _Book_
is this explained, although one might take stabs at it. Is there a
"canonical" explanation of essences and substances?

How marvelous to find this newsgroup!  I had tried several times to
subscribe to the Tekumel mailing list that the AoL search function kept
insisting was there, but it must have died well before.

I don't think I have laughed so hard at anything in the past five or six
years as I did at the lightbulb jokes posted previously, especially Dermot
Bolton's.  It took quite a bit of explaining to the people in my office
who found me curled up on the floor choking with delight.

I got my first copy of the old EPT back in the 70s when I was in high
school, but didn't get a chance to run any games until much later.  I will
dig out the adventures I put together and see if there is any material
worthy of contribution to this august assembly; due to my love for the
green-hats of Baron Ald, much of my material had a northerly bent to it.

Are there any groups gaming the lands of Tekumel in the Washington DC
area?  I participated in a brief BBS game locally, but it died for lack of
interest.  I have done little role-playing since I left college, but would
jump back in with both feet were I too find a Tekumelani group.  S.
Foster's description of the London campaign gives me reason #234 to
emigrate to the UK.

You overlook the obvious.

At that point, the sensible netcom rep would simply email the individual 
-- but it appears someone wanted to hold something over someone's head.  
Contacting the individual was *not* the reason for disabling the
account.  Claims to the contrary aren't credible.

Apparently that credit wasn't sufficient.  Perhaps analyzing the policy
and counseling the person who made the decision to disable the account
would have been more appropriate.

Hmm...

There seems to be a big following of the Worm Lord out there.

After I finish the Shen and Hlaka, I will likely add turn to Legion of the 
Fishers of Flame for YK and Legion of the Mighty Prince for Tsol., shortly
followed by Scales of Brown. (I had initially intended to keep this legion
further down on the priority list, but I bet it will sell well. It will
be a while before I get to undead, but you can use Ral Partha skeletons
in the interim.)

After these, then I'll get to the command and priest packs, which I think are
essential before going on to another nation. 

Thanks for the input.

I am willing to purchase (and pay top $) Vols III-V of the Armies of Tekumel.
Specifically these contain the army lists for Mu'ugalavya, Salarvya and
Livyanu. They were produced in 1981 by Adventure Games and retailed for $3.95.
Unfortunately, I was stupid and didn't buy them when they were available.

If interested, email me your price, and I will get back to you.

Greetings All:

Just got back from Historicon, a historical miniatures show in PA, USA.
TOME was there, in their alternate guise as Clash of Arms Games.

They had some copies of Adventures on Tekumel: Part Two, Volume Three:
Beneath the Lands of Tsolyanu. It was just back from the printers, and
they brought some copies along (why to a historical game show? because
I've bugged them everytime...)

Looks good, but the puns are bad. Be forewarned.

TOME rep confirms that MAR Barker is working on the new rules. Due date?
1.5 years from now. Other new products (temples, etc.). De nada until new
rules are out, or so this rep said.

Sigh.

I wonder if anyone out there can enlighten me as to why TOME has spent
such a great deal of effort so far into producing three volumes of
solo adventures (which I personally doubt anyone has "played" as such)
and a character generation system (somewhat pointless to me, it seems,
without an RPG to use them with), instead of spending that effort on
things like the new rules, religious info, republishing the S&G source
materials, more detailed descriptions of regions of the Five Empires
(I'm thinking something along the lines of the Harn regional modules
here - expand on the constant "et ceteras" one sees in the S&G
material), etc.

I mean, perhaps the solo adventures are useful as a source of ideas,
but in general the concept baffles me. Just what is TOME's strategy
here?

(In my ultimate dream world, TOME would publish equivalents to "The
Tsolyani Language" for the other four major languages and
Engsvanyali. I have this feeling that Barker has materials on them,
beacuse he seems to be able to come up with equivalents to Tsolyani
terms that seem to have a coherent etymology. Of course, about nine
people besides me would buy them all.)

  Make that 11.  I know at least two more, including myself, who
would buy them. :)  Sigh.  TOME makes Columbia look like jack rabbits
when it comes to putting out material.

Glad to hear its out.

As I have reported earlier, the rules are finished, they need to be laid out
and typeset. I can't imagine this taking 18 months. I'd guess 6 months
tops. Unless this is some problem at TOME (lack of cash).
