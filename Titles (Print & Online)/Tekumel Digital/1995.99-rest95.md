What is the status of the Eye of All-Seeing Wonder?  How many issues have
been published?  What ever happened to plans to distribute it through
TOME?  Where can one get back issues?

Sorry, I know I've seen the answers to these questions, but not lately, so
I had to ask.  And don't bother flaming me; as a worshipper of Lord
Vimuhla, I will just enjoy the burn <g>!

I live in Falls Church, VA.  I and several of my friends are putting
together a Garidsyal campaign that will run here and in Baltimore.  Some
are experienced role-players, others are not; same with Tekumel knowledge.
 For example, I am reading my wife _The Man of Gold_ right now, with
off-line explanations of selected topics, to give her some background in
Tekumel, since she would like to play in the campaign.

Drop me an e-line some time; perhaps we could get together.

The following letter was written by a participating member in this
program.

To those with the COMMON sense to participate in this easy money
opportunity: About six months ago I received the enclosed post in
letter
form.  I ignored it.  I received about five more of the same letter
within the next two week.  I ignored them also.  Of course, I was
tempted to follow through and dreamed of making thousands, but I was
convinced it was just another gimmick and could not possibly work.
 I was wrong!  About three weeks later I saw this same letter posted
on
a local bulletin board in Montreal.  I liked the idea of giving it a
try
with my computer.  I didn't expect much because I figured, if other
people were as skeptical as I, they would not be too quick to part
with
$5.00.  But, I BUY LOTTERY TICKETS WEEKLY IN MY PROVINCE AND HAVE
NOTHING TOO SHOW FOR IT BUT TICKET STUBS!  This week I decided to
look at this as my weekly lottery purchase.  I addressed the envelopes
and mailed out $1.00 in each as directed. Two weeks went by and I
didn't
receive anything in the mail.  The fourth week rolled around and I
couldn't believe what happened!  I can not say that I received
$50,000.00, but it was definitely well over $35,000.00!  For the first
time in 10 years I got out of debt.  It was great.  Of course, it did
not take me long to go through my earnings, so I am using this
excellent
money making opportunity once again.  FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS AND GET
READY TO ENJOY!  Please send a copy of this letter along with the
enclosed letter so together we can convince people who are skeptical
that this really does work!

Another opinion,
JUST DO IT!! You can hardly say you've been done on only $5. Don't
think
about it, just do out the letters and send them. complete list of
music
mailing lists at server.berkeley.edu /pub/misc/lomml. A complete list
of
interest groups can be found at ftp.nisc.sri.com in

   Do you really think anyone would read a spam called "Clueless Dork
will sell you stupid info"?  I think the least we could do would be to
overload his e-mail with personalized flames.

I'm interested buddy, but that free cable is HARD to get.  I have tried 
it, and one of the parts is almost IMPOSSIBLE to get.  And anyway, I've 
tried to unscramble the pixel arrangement on one of those, and it didn't 
work.  Me and about 10 other friends did it.  If you are going to give 
me a way NOT printed in the COOKBOOK then I'm all for it, but if it's 
the same old shit then forget it.

I have heard that there is a new release of EPT by Tome.  Is this correct?

Is it any good?

I am interested in getting the new version, getting up to speed and running it 
again.

Thank....

Yes, there are two parts needed:  Adventures on Tekumel (for detailed
character generation) and Gardasiyal for the rest.  A Bestiary is also
available.  Total package price is 11+45+19=$75.00 (US)

Of course, this is really two questions that will be debated hotly over
the millenia by adherents of the 20, but I think you will find it
intriguing, unless you are a follower of one of the Pariah dieties, or
worse... (is there worse?  another debate for another time)

It's available online via The Greenleaf Online Store

available off Bob Alberti's Empire of the Petal Throne page

                       The Adventurer's Companion
                 Fantasy Role-Playing exchange magazine
 
 
 If you like role-playing magazines, you'll love The Adventurer's
 Companion. It's the best of the bunch. New spells, stories, magic items,
 puzzles, adventures, product reviews, etc..
 
 The Adventurer's Companion is an electronic magazine (or e-zine for you
 net-heads) focusing on Fantasy Role-Playing Games. Although the focus is
 generally centered around the fantasy genre, we will include articles on
 any type of RPG.
 
 This magazine is a great way for role-players to exchange ideas and
 creations. Almost every role-player has thought up some new type of rule

   I would love to play or run a game, I'm currently in the Norfolk, VA
area.  Unfortunanatly I haven't played it YET.  However, it is the
first Fantasy RPG that I really like (and I've got quite a few).

   I'm going to assume that you are talking about the paperback books
here.  There are two "The Man of Gold" and "Flamesong".  If you are
talking about the RPG rules/supplements I've got a copy of the list.

Also on ftp.cica.indiana.edu, as a publicity exercise.  Glad to know someone 
is using it.  I did try doing a Yan Kor font, using scanned in glyphs from 
Swords & Glory I, but the glyphs were too small to be usable for this.

    What exactly do you mean by to small?  What if you increase the
characters to something like 20pt in your document?  
    In any case I for one wouldn't mind seeing the font made available,
after all an inperfect font is better than no font.

Yes, I have played using the system, 3 games now.  It isn't bad.  The
Quickplay combat system moves melee along very quickly, and the HP system
adds a touch of realistic feel, as wounds are done to specific body parts.
Combat tends to be short--usually only one or two hits are all that are
needed to down a foe, and the result is usually not entirely fatal.  In the
Quickplay system, foes are downed with "incapacitate" results, leaving lots
of prisoners and good chances to recover your friends if you win, and you're
either taken prisoner or killed if you lose.
   The magic system is "Swords and Glory lite".  It also moves fairly quickly,
and there is plenty of variety for spell-casters.
   In fairness, my experienced players prefer the Tirikelu rules published
in the Eye of All-seeing Wonder.  Tirikelu offers more options for melee,
but less of a realistic feel, I think.
   Don't make the mistake of believing this is going to be a GREAT set of
rules, however.  The experience system is inadequate, the character generation
system can be confusing until you've generated a number of characters,
and the encounter tables are a bit too generic.  Over all, I recommend the
rules--they are well-suited to Tekumel, and by buying them, you are supporting
the company that sells Tekumel stuff.

The original characters in the book are only about a third of an inch high. 
 I scanned these in, but to use for a font I have to blow them up to 72 
point (the largest size in the font).  They promptly turn into faceless 
blobs (as in fact they are anyway).  The results are useless, lacking beauty 
or accuracy, and I'm afraid I gave up at that point.

I'd usually agree, but not in this case, believe me.  You'd be better off 
doing it by hand.  I saw how it was going, and stopped part way.

Since many of the most complex life forms of Tekumel have survived to the 
present day, they must have breathed an atmosphere of similar *bulk* 
composition, although the trace constituents may have been different. The 
slimy, stinking swamps suggest, perhaps, substantial ecosystems 
supporting anaerobic respiration and hence releasing methane. Enough 
methane photolysis products might have turned the clouds yellow, although 
perhaps not with so much oxygen about.

I have a large bibliography of terraforming-related literature available 
if anybody is interested. Email me and I'll send it.

Will someone please explain to me how any one country 
can dictate censorship to the world. The Internet is 
not an American (or any other country) entity. Will the 
U.S. Government come to my door here in Canada and haul 
me off to a U.S. prison if they suspect some profanity 
or pornographic material eminating from my system? Will 
they go to Germany or Japan and do the same?
WHO? is going to censor the Internet and HOW? is what I 
wanna know!!

>From  what I've read of this idiotic piece of legislation is that the
sender, receiver, and any node in between will be guilty.  Thus, you
can't really be hurt by it, unless our excuse for a government wants
to talk to your government, etc.  However, every sysop in between
is fair game.  Thus we'll have to put controls on what you can send
into our country to make sure it's not violating any laws, etc.  And
to make matters even more rediculous, the material will be
considered offensive, if it violates the "community standards" of
any area if flows through.  So some purer than thou twerp has
his system set to scan for those dirty words that are passing 
through his system on the way to somewhere else.  He gets a beep,
calls the FBI or whoever is going to enforce this tripe, and here we
go.  It doesn't matter that the message wasn't for him, since there
isn't any law protecting the privacy of E-Mail.  All that matters is
that it touched down on his system.

The net (no pun intended) result is that america will have to be
disconnected from the rest of the world.

Of course, my personal view is that it won't stand up to the first 
court challange, but I might be wrong.  Things are getting mighty
wierd around here.

Martin:

While I don't have your background in terraforming, is it 
necessary to assume that the planet was geologically stable 
before it was terraformed.  Possible options in this case include 
1) an atmosphere heavy with sulphurous gases and/or 2) dust 
suspended in the upper atmosphere that made everything appear 
yellow at the time.  In a sulphurous environment, I would think 
that plants and animals that thrived in this environment would 
have a more acidic body chemistry as well as higher tolerances 
for acid in general.  Food which would be considered sour to us 
might be a delicacy to natives of this environment.  Logically, 
chemical weapons of plants and animals that developed as a 
natural means of self defense were probably basis.  Given the 
above, it might be possible to drive off s'su by pelting them 
with jalapeno peppers; it would be like throwing lye on us.  I 
also doubt that you would ever see a s'su swim in the ocean.  
This may have been the reason that the black s'su are only 
indigenous to an island; at the time, the ocean may have been a 
means of effectively imprisoning them without killing them.  

This leads to the next thought ... I would doubt that the oceans 
existed in even an approximation of their present volume prior to 
mankind.

  Ok stupid(satan).  Spell "YOur"

  Your post is a testament to the reason he warned about
cheating, full of grammatical errors and petty.  Do something
new.  Go read a book, if you can.

this message ...

Dr. Barker,

Most of the supplements written for EPT are no longer in print.  
Is there any way to get copies?  Alternately, do you expect to 
publish new editions of these works in the near future?

  The problem with treating kids as equals is that they then spam multiple
newsgroups with totally irrelevant, long, non-grammar-checked posts that
use non-standard ascii extensions.

Do you want to go from english->tsolyani or tsolyani->english?

You could try looking for a copy of the Tsolyani dictionary (there are of 
people in this group who could suggest a supplier in your neck of woods), 
or, to start, maybe someone who feels really nice would offer the 
whereabouts of a copy of the old 'Tsolyani Primer'.

Translation is beyond me, I'm afraid, but I know people who can.

..and I'd love a copy of the font, or the address of the copyright owner.

Typical of those who buy term papers: can't spell, can't punctuate, and 
can't choose the right homonym.

Freak? I think not.

Yeah prove to everyone that you are really smart and can hand in a copy of
a fake essay.  THese essays are so generic that any decent teacher will be
able to see through them.  I know that when I become a teacher, I wil
definitely look up all these essays on my computer and then nail any sorry
student who tries to pull one over me.

    I was looking at my copy of Swords & Glory, vol 1 book 1 today and
the following has made me wonder.

    "The first explorers looked down upon a world almost uninhabitable
by man.  Poisonous purple vegetation covered the land from pole to
pole; many-legged mucid monsters splashed in tidal pools of stinking
slime; quaking seas of mud roiled with vermiform life; brooding,
crumpled mountain peaks raked skies filled with clouds of yellow gas." 
    It also mentions the purple jungles, the deadly flora and fauna,
and how mankind terraformed the planet.  I mean the even changed it's
orbit and gravity!  Now that is what I call technology, is it any
wonder that the relics of that bygone era appear to be magic to those
of us who live in these latter times!

    Now what I'm wondering is this, just what kind of a atmosphere did
Tekumel originally have, and what was life on Tekumel based upon?  Is
in oxygen based, or is it based on something else?


                                Zane


P.S.  Is there anyway that this could be changed into a moderated
newsgroup?  This would get rid of all of the postings that don't belong
here.  It is getting so they far outnumber the legitimate posts.  I'd
volunteer to help with this, but my job keeps me away from any
connection to the net for weeks on end unfortunatly.

(I can't believe we're getting so worked up over a guy who mentions the 
word "Satan," but anyway)

Wow.  From this message, I can deduce the following:

	1) Satan can't spell
	2) The words "Love" and "Satan" appears on the same line
	3) Satan calls someone else "freak"
	4) Satan felt the need to flame someone (pun intended)

Sorry to interrupt this, gents, but this discussion is being cross-posted

doesn't belong.  Could you ensure you don't post to alt.games.frp.tekumel on

    Hope this helps, I put this together a few months ago out of three
messages I found in the archives.  The list is mostly thanks to
material originally put together by Phil Polli and Brett Slocum.  I've
tried to sort it by the start of a countries involvement.

Easy out!  The original atmosphere almost certainly had to be breathable
by humans, because the Ssu and Hluss can breathe it now.  There may have
been minor differences, but it is doubtful they were too extreme.  The
Shunned Ones seem to have always lived in sealed cities on Tekumel.

Yes, this spamming is getting out of hand.  A moderated Tekumel newsgroup
exists at Blueroom@spectre.prin.edu.  Check it out!

On Creating and Developing Characters in Gardasiyal
 
I've been generating a lot of characters using the Adventures
on Tekumel booklet for Gardasiyal.  To develop a traditional,
adventuring character, that character should plan on joining the
priesthood or the military to acquire the necessary  skills.
Joining  the priesthood, either to learn sorcery, or to be
another type of priest, is fairly well documented in Adventures
On Tekumel, Part 2, Vol. 1 (the blue book), in section C.  Note:
there does seem to be a gap in becoming 3rd and 4th circle.  I
have dealt with this as follows:
 
Inducements to become 2nd circle: 3,000 K per +1 on the promotion
roll.  Roll d10 for clan assistance: 1-5 = no assistance; 6-9 = the
clan pays 3,000 K; 10 = the clan pays 6,000 K.
 
Inducements to become 3rd circle: 4,000 K per +1 on the promotion
roll.  Roll d10 for clan assistance: 1-2 = no assistance; 3-7 = the
clan pays 4,000 K; 8-9 = the clan pays 8,000 K; 10 = the clan pays
12,000 K.
 
Inducements to become 4th circle: 5,000 K per +1 on the promotion
roll.  The clan will automatically pay 15,000 K (+3) on the roll.
 
However, if you want to join the army, there is no equivalent
system for promotions.  Instead, you receive basic training,
possibly get a promotion, and then go to the front, where you
may get promoted, may get killed, and may get loot.  Although it
is true that any character who just got out of the army and
intends to begin adventuring in 2364 was probably an active soldier
at the front, it also completely ignores skill development, and it
does nothing either for those legions who did not go to the front,
or for those characters who have been out of the army for more
than 5 years.
 
To remedy this problem, I have created a set of guidelines for
soldiers that parallel the priestly advancement rules.
 
1. Go through basic training, as in Adventures Part 2, Vol 1, section
B, starting on p. 42.  NOTE: According to the sourcebook, if you
want to join a temple Legion of the War Gods (Karakan, Chegarra,
Vimuhla, and Chiteng), you must have at least one level of religion.
As best as I can tell, these legions are:
 
The Legion of the Givers of Sorrow
The Legion of Lord Chegarra
The Legion of the Lord of Red Devastation
 
and possibly:
 
The Legion of Searing Flame
The Legion of Glorious Destiny
The Legion of the Wind of Iron
The Legion of the Citadel of Glory
 
After basic training, you may try for a promotion once per year.
Each year, half of your skills must go to Soldier skills, and
half go to Warrior.  If, because of restrictions, you cannot
spend the full allotment of points in either Warrior or Soldier,
you may put the extra points in the other group.  Notice that you
may not buy any more than 2 levels of any skill per year!
 
For Soldier skills, you must have 5 levels in any two apiece of
the first three skills before you may buy "Military History".
You must have at least 5 levels in each skill above the first three
to buy the next one up (that is, you cannot take "Artillery" until you
have at least 5 levels of "Military History", and you cannot take
"Military Engineering and Sapping" until you have at least 5 levels
of "Artillery", etc.  If you have at least 6 levels in each of the
first three soldier skills, you may opt to buy one additional
level of each of these, and use the remainder of your skill points
to add to your Warrior skills.
 
For Warrior skills, you must invest your skills only in the weapons
used by your legion; any additional weapons can only be learned as
hobbies, at a rate of 3 levels of hobby competence equals 1 level
of useable competence.  (Exception: you may learn "Dagger" and
"Fisticuffs and Brawling" with your warrior skills)  If you don't
have access to "Armies of Tekumel, Vol. 1", you can  assume for now
that every infantry Legion uses long spear, long sword, and  large
shield, archery, crossbow and slinger Legions use the appropriate
missile weapon, a small shield, and a short sword.  Notice that
you may ignore the rules about knowing two of the first five
weapons before learning your Legion's weapons.
 
To be promoted, roll on the Priestly Promotions table (C.1) on
page 80.  Soldiers do not typically get clan support for promotion
(they got the big bonus when they were first recruited, but as
referees, use your judgment as to whether the clan will fund
later promotions), but they do get a skill-based bonus.  Total
your Soldier skills and divide by 3, rounding the result up.
Subtract 2 from this if you are trying to reach the Hereksa rank,
subtract 4 if you are trying to reach Kasi, and 6 if you are trying
for higher ranks (although this should only be possible once you
have entered the role-playing game).  Players are welcome to pay
inducements out of their personal funds, if they choose, using
the same modifiers as priests do (use circles as ranks).  As for
the priesthoods, after 3 failures for the same promotion, you will
no longer be  considered with favor, and you will not receive a
promotion save for extraordinary bravery.
 
If your character joins one of the Legions of Marines, then you
must add an additional skill of "Sailor" to the list of basic Soldier
skills; I put it just after "Field Tactics", and treat it as one of
the basic three--you can invest skill points in it before you
have mastered lower level ones.  Presumably, if your character
joins one of the Sapper or Artillery Legions, the appropriate Soldier
skills should be considered one of the basic three as well.
 
I have found this system works well, and it gives players a bit of
a feel for their character before they even enter the game.  However,
I confess to a couple of problems with this system (hence, this post).
 
1. Promotions are very difficult.  The Sourcebook says the average
person can expect a promotion every year until they reach a point
where seekers for office outnumber openings (this sounds like Kasi
for the military, and maybe 6th circle for priests).  However, unless
your character is truly extraordinary (with intelligence, comeliness,
and charisma ALL above 80, or with lots of wealth), you can expect
a promotion 20% of the time; 50% if you get a +1.  Without any bonuses
to the die roll, it is likely that a character will have three
failures and either stop advancing, or get kicked out of the priesthood:
an average character without any bonuses to the die roll, has a 51%
chance to fail three promotion rolls in a row, vs. a 49% chance of
getting at least one successful promotion roll on three tries!
In any case, promotion is much slower than the Sourcebook says it
should be.
 
2. Perhaps more galling to a structure-oriented person such as
myself, is that it is impossible to create characters that match
the Gardasiyal archetypes or NPCs using these rules!  Sure, we could
just abandon them in favor of the more streamlined system below,
but I believe my rules fit both what Professor Barker has already
provided, and the spirit of the game, in general.  I have already
been criticized on this point: "You're the referee, creating NPCs!
Give them whatever skills you want!"  Sure, but what are players
supposed to do?  A soldier should have an HBS of 150, a veteran
soldier an HBS of 200, an officer an HBS of 200 to 250; my characters
have HBS 160 - 170 with their legion's weapon after 5 or more years
of training, and they are usually of Hereksa or Kasi rank.  This is
clearly inferior to the NPC tables in Section Eleven of Gardasiyal.
While I'm at it, it is also impossible for characters to  acheive 5th
level sorcerer if they go through the sorcerer generation
rules in the blue book.
 
The blunt solution is to ignore the skill development rules in
Adventures on Tekumel, and simply say that characters
automatically get 2-3 skill levels per year in their Legion's weapon,
perhaps 6 skill levels to invest in soldier skills.  (I'm not sure
what to do with sorcerers.)  You would also get automatically
1-2 levels in any extra skills the Legion has, such as desert or
forest skills, sailing, etc.  After 5 years as a soldier, you
would have at least 10-15 skill levels in the legion's weapon,
which would bring you close to the HBS of 150, depending on
your other characteristics.  This system works for creating
NPCs (but is unnecessary, as few NPCs need this much detail),
and for fast creation of PCs, but it takes some of the personality
out of character development.
 
 
Anybody have any thoughts or comments on this?  Anybody else
using Gardasiyal for gaming?

OK, now I have the font.  It is so great that I shall be sending the 
author a small piece of steel chain as a reward (the most valuable thing 
I have on earth...unless maybe the author would prefer a pre-paid holiday 
in the isles of Tsolei, which is where I'm about to send my characters!)

In the 'read.me' he tells you how to make fully scalable fonts from 
glyph.bmp files that you scan in.  One clever chap.  Must be a scholar 
priest of Ketenku.

Go get it people, then use it to fill in you tax returns!

This is all possible. However the point I was making is that the ranges 
of physiological tolerance of higher organisms are not all that wide. 
Thus, since the native races of Tekumel are clearly aerobic creatures 
now, they must have been so before the terraforming took place. Tekumel 
must have had an oxygenic atmosphere before humans got there. However, 
this fact does not stop one proposing a drastically different 
pre-existing climate and differing atmospheric trace constituent 
chemistry. One can imagine a number of chromophores that might have 
changed the colour of the Tekumelian sky---chemical aerosols and dust 
particles for instance. After all, look at Mars---we expected the sky to 
be deep blue or near-black and were unprepared for its dust-tinted 
salmon-pink. Terraforming Mars might involve creating an earthlike 
hydrological cycle which should wash a lot of the dust out in rain. The 
sky would go from pink to blue---a shame perhaps, but compensated for by 
the fact that martian rainbows would be truly spectacular and long 
lasting (due to the lower gravity).

These points also apply to higher plants also. It is a commonly held 
belief that since plants produce oxygen when they grow, they don't need 
any from the atmosphere. This is not true. Plants are as aerobic as you 
or I. Well---almost so. Plant roots start to suffer at pO2's of less than 
about 20 - 60 mbar.

On a similar vein,

I know a couple of guys who would be delighted to offer to provide the 
diaries of scenarios which took players deep into the crust to visit the 
keepers of the terra forming engines, and in one case involved a little 
visit to one of the weather satellites and then on to a sealed base deep 
inside on of the moons, where the solar flux was being controlled.  [This 
was before we realised that tekumel was full of people, and before we 
decided that role playing was more fun than huge pyrotechnics..still, 
once in while it makes a  change, eh?)
 
A resident biochemist once tried to convince me that human blood, being 
quite iron rich would be poison to Akho who live in a light earth metal 
soup .  I think that would be cold comfort if your ship was shredded.  

What this lead to was a long discussion as to just how much engineering / 
evolution of the races must have occurred for them to survive.  Take the 
blood example; if Tekumel is so low in iron, were do people get it from?  
We hypothesised that there were four mechanisms:

1) early genetic engineering, to make the human body capable of 
extracting minute amounts, and to retain them jealously;

2) specially adapted crops, which are super efficient at extracting the 
minerals needed by people, probably aided by bacteria and fungi in the 
soil;

3) cultural adaptations (yes, they use 'night soil' as a fertiliser) 
which encourage recycling;

4) good old evolution;

BUT NO CHARACTERS CAN EVER KNOW THIS

What is great to play is a mini-campaign involving sewerage workers, or 
night soil collectors, and the grief that they have to put up with. They 
have tremendous pride in their work, and _they_ know there jobs are 
important.  They have a terrific relationship with local farmers, and get 
the 'pick of the crop' in terms of lost items, things dropped down 
latrines, etc.  Maybe a few could be sent to set up a recycling centre 
(complete with pit, ponds, fish, sedges, filtration and soil 
conditioning) to a newly re-colonised part of the Empire, where the soils 
are very poor and the people are suffering from nutrient deficiency 
(read: strange affliction of Gorun Tke, or some such).  The local 
priestess of Avanthe has diagnosed soil sickness and needs your help!

Yep, have you seen Jack Bramahs lists of legions and a quick guide to 
promotions in the 'eye of allseeing wonder'?

Other than that, I really prefer making the characters game their 
networking and EARN favours from people, rather than just 'dear clan 
uncle can I have 15,000 K to buy my promotion?'

With priests I had a long look at the whole process, and came up with 
ideas much like Gardasiyal.  What I would change is the mechanical/linear 
approach.  It is possible to leap up a couple at a time, but remember to 
game the consequences, such as rivals.

This is not only an interesting thread but on topic as well!

    Apparently io.com recently changed it's name to ftp.io.com .  I
suspect that this is part of a tend where there are www.*.* and ftp.*.*
servers.  Instead of the older *.*.* server.  Anyway going from memory
it is:

        ftp.io.com  /pub/tekumel

Anyway I know that it is ftp.io.com .

Well did anyone out there see the Lost Civilzations show on Rome. There
was this huge communal toilet area, where people sat and talked all while
doing their business. The show claimed that all walks of life met there
and talked, an exchange of info, from the low status to the high status.

Well, I thought about Tekumel and it wouldn't be quite the same. I 
imagined a huge pyramid of a toilet, and watch out if someone of
high clan decides to shake.

One could also imagine how a sewer worker you describe above, would
be treated similar to a slave trader. The sewer worker would have his
pick of the crop and eat well, but would be avoided as an untouchable
in public. In fact so untouchable, that store owners would give them
items to keep them away. In fact, please just send a messenger and
we'll have someone deliver, thank you, don't come again.

Yes and speaking of soil sickness above, some ignorant local ruler
had the Untouchable Clan run off. Didn't like such riff-raff in his
town, maybe one of them accidently touched him. The commodes are now
backed up and the people are withering. The local ruler still doesn't
have a clue.

The American government, because they founded the Internet, believe
that they can control it's content. This despite the fact that it is
no longer government sponsered or operated and that most of the sites
are non-government, non-educational based.

They do not accept the fact that it is international, and believe that
they can control it because 60% of the sites at present are within
their borders. 

They've decided that freedom is a relative term and that it should
never equate the true definition or concept that created it or the
government that they were supposed to be (instead of the government
they have become).

It IS a violation of netiquette.  Report it to the person's postmaster,
including a copy of the post, WITH the names of all the groups posted to.

WIRED? From what I've seen, every issue contains a rabble-rousing piece of 
one-sided alarmist journalism, from the 'Big Brother is Watching You' type 
article about video surveillance in May to this alleged internet censorship 
stuff.

Wired is way overpriced for a mag which doesn't have a disk on the cover. I 
like _some_ of the graphics, but the content is rather week. Better to just 
drop some acid and read an old issue of GQ, I reckon :)

Good lord, are you a masochist or what? Yes, it's annoying that he
cross-posted to every group this side of Leningrad, but do you realize
how much more annoying it would be if he had posted to each group 
individually?

Any halfway decent newsreader (actually, I can't think of an exception
here) will show you a crossposted post *ONCE*. After you've read it,
it won't show up in all the other groups it's been posted to. If he had 
posted individually, you would see this post over, and over, and over...

Which makes more sense to you?

The problem with those 3 files is that they use the 
helvetica-condensed series of fonts, and a number of 
printers don't have them... :(

I do have versions that I've hacked about with, and 
they print OK.

I don't know how Steve Foster/Dave Morris will view these 
hacked about versions floating around, but I could post 
them to the group if anyone else has the problem...
(Steve already has them.)

Summary: GURPS Worldbook!
Keywords: GURPS, Tekumel, marmosets

As I have discussed with some friends who enjoy Tekumel and who know a little
more about the gaming industry than I, what Tekumel really needs is a good
GURPS worldbook, along the lines of the White Wolf adaptations Steve Jackson
Games did a few years ago.  A GURPS worldbook could almost certainly be 
organized as a one-shot deal--one book only, no sequels, etc with complete
editorial control given to the good Professor.  That way, creative control
over his very personal gameworld would be retained.  Steve Jackson Games could
advertise it quite well, and a lot of GURPS fans would buy it just because
it's a GURPS product and get hooked.  I believe that this has been mentioned   
before here, and that it was said that the Professor does not like the idea
(I don't know why).

Maybe there are some aspects of the deal I don't understand--for example,
I think it was mentioned that the people at TOME are not willing to give
up their sole title to the material--but I really think that this is a 
really good solution on paper.  As I recall, SJG actually expressed an
interest in such a project once.  Judging from their previous products, a
GURPS Tekumel book would have great editing and format, decent art, and
good product support--your local game store *would* be able and encouraged
to order it.

Please, someone who speaks to the Professor mention this to him--I would
post it to the mailing list, but I don't feel comfortable telling the
Professor his business (and someone who plays with him might be more
knowledgable about the pro's and con's).  As someone who loves Tekumel,
I want to see it attain the popularity and commercial success it deserves.

Nah, all the Americans have buggered off to the Blue Room to complain

complaining about the Brits...

Yes, that was the point. I wasn't 'trashing entire rule sets' as Bob
suggested: I even included my own game in the list quite deliberately
for this reason. I was suggesting that it's important to try to
understand how Tekumel works (and I don't care what Bob or the Prof
say, I treat it as if it's a real place), and then to model our game
systems on that. I'm not interested in slagging off basic mechanics.
That's not the level of debate at all. The point is, how are those
mechanics tuned to reflect society?

For example, in Tirikelu, mechanics reflect the idea of loss of face,
by using Discredits as a penalty to social advancement, and Honour as
a characteristic that prevents you shrugging them off. In the set of
rules I will be using (mutated Water Margin), the Chinese origins of
the game are evident, and I have focussed more on the necessity of
using influence. Characters have a respect score, which assists them
in influencing others, and which may be increased by doing
'honourable' things, as well as by impressing others that they are
someone to be reckoned with. Obtaining favours ffrom others leads to
the acquisition of 'debts of gratitude', and ignoring these may lead
to loss of respect. Similarly, doing favours for others may lead to
them owing you a debt of gratitude, which may be called in later.

Which of these gives the best feel of Tekumel? Anyone can be
wishy-washy and say 'Well, it depends what you like'. I'm not
interested in hearing that: I don't have to connect to the Internet to
work that out. I want to hear peoples' experience and see what they
think.

I want to experience the culture of Tekumel. If it was just a matter
of monsters and dungeon bashes I'd never have stopped playing original
D&D in Judges' Guild's Blackmoor.

I have every reason to believe that Dave's Tirikelu rules represent
Tsolyanu better than mine, since his were actually written for
Tsolyanu, whereas mine were ported over from a game about China. Of
course it's possible that both capture a part of the truth.

Graham is right in saying that pretty well any set of rules can be
modified for use with Tekumel. At the same time he is also right in
saying that in order to modify successfully you need to be pretty
familiar with the world. Subscribers to this newsgroup are, I presume,
pretty familiar with the world, so what do you think?

For example, although I agree that RuneQuest is a prime candidate for
use as a Tekumel game system, I was shocked on reading Sandy
Petersen's RQ Tekumel rules that he appeared not to understand which
way round clan and lineage worked. My faith in that particular
implementation of the RQ  rules as an appropriate system for Tekumel
was immediately shaken.

So what do you think?

Not to be a sourpuss, Paul, but Blueroom has not had a peep about
Gardasiyal, pro, con, or otherwise.  It's banned from the discussion
to avoid driving Prof Barker off the internet completely!

Funny you should mention this.  I can't talk about GURPS, because I'm
sure I don't know the whole story, but I am posting to the Blueroom
today a call for volunteers to help write a one volume Tekumel sourcebook.
It won't have the SJG muscle backing it, but having a product like this
will help a lot.  Theron, you and your friends are encouraged to contribute!
Check out the blueroom (blueroom@prin.edu) for details.

Actually, I don't use these particular rules because I feel they hamstring
role playing to some degree.  I'm sure players can have a lot of fun with
them, and they would add a whole new dimension to the game, but I prefer
to let the players be a bit more flexible in their responses.  On the
other hand, the players' goal is simply to amass wealth to repair the
fortunes of their clan, and they are also in Salarvya, where Tsolyani
niceties aren't so important.
 
On the whole, I've found the British systems (I'm including you there,
Paul, because of your spelling) place much more emphasis on honor and
face than Americans do.  Maybe it's because I've heard much more from
experienced British players than Americans.
 
Certainly, reading the Deeds of Ever-Glorious shows theconcern Tsolyani
show for keeping their word, and the honor this brings.  The question is,
how much is this a question of personal or clan honor, and how much blind
obedience to the God-Emperor's commands?  There's enough slick, underhanded
politicking that the novels reminded me more of American politics than
Shogun.  I also believe that Tekumel should be treated as a real place--
part of the question is of the nature of that real place.  I get a very
different "spin" on Tsolyani society from the articles in the Eye of
Allseeing Wonder than I do from Barker's own stuff.  Not wrong; just a
different emphasis.

My experience?  In the games I've been in (run by the very capable Mark
Daniels from England) the emphasis has been on social interaction, with a
bit of dungeon crawling--but we didn't get very far, having only two games.
Honor and face didn't enter into the limited scenarios at all.  In the games
I've run, I've tried dungeon crawls (not popular), and found players like
to interact with themselves and colorful NPCs best.  Only two of our players
are focused on honor, the rest being interesting in scheming to gain power.
Could I use an honor system?  Yes.  Maybe I will even introduce it to see
how it goes.  Other than that, we've tried both Gardasiyal and Tirikelu,
but there was no difference in play style, except for a lot more grumbling
about Gardasiyal's less certainty of spell success.  Over time, the differences
in combat lethality would probably tell.  In my game, the role playing has
taken over the rules, rather than vice versa.  (I give all credit to my
players for this, not for my refereeing skills!)

Having spent some time discussing Tekumel gaming with Sandy, I can say
his philosophy is the opposite of yours.  He is far more concerned with
what makes a fun game than with verisimilitude.  I don't think he is so
much an expert at the Tekumel background as he is at running good games.
The Tekumel Runequest rules do have some background errors (the different
temples should not be considered "cults"), but they could be modified
easily enough to fix these errors.  But Runequest will be no different
for gaming than Gardasiyal or any other set of rules that don't use
mechanics to force players to make choices about an honorable decision
as opposed to an expedious one.
 
To continue this thought, look at the behavior of Lord Tekunu (if I have
the spelling right).  During yearly Jakalla food riots, he goes up on the
roof with a bow and shoots rioters.  Legal, but ignoble.  The Professor
lets the player get away with it, but says he's a bit ostracized for it.
The honor rules could penalize the player for it (I'm not sure; I'm not
familiar enough with them to say off the top of my head if shooting peasants
is bad) or simply fail to recognize this as a transgression.  Are you going
to use mechanics to penalize, or use NPCs and role playing?  The Professor
can do this in his head, but the rest of us need a guide.  I think, Paul,
the question is as much one of how you wish to deal with issues as which
issues you want to emphasize.
 
How many of us deal with questions of honor that explicitly?  I'm afraid
I'll have to say I don't--it's never been that important, because my
campaigns have never had players in a situation where it's real important.
It might become important later.

Has anyone noticed that Prof. Barker wrote *himself* into "Coming

Material with either generic gaming stats or no gaming stats at
all is definitely the way to go. If a system has to be attached
to it then GURPS is probably as good a _lingua_franca_ as any,
and certainly gets my vote over EPT, S&G, Gardasiyal or any of
the supposedly 'official' Tekumel rules systems.

It also occurs to me that posting this material on the Net is
probably -- at the moment -- the most cost-effective way of
getting it out to a wider gaming public. Unless either TOME or
Prof. Barker would let another company publish such a thing ...
in which case, please email me IMMEDIATELY.

I'm very happy to announce the creation of a new on-line rpg, Infinity. 
Infinity is a fantasy rpg that takes it's history from Arena, a one year old 
prodigy rpg. Infinity is based in a exotic land where anything can happen, 
and usually does. Where the most powerful creatures in the cosmos live, and 
powers that were ancient before humans were even around are common 
knowledge. The best thing about this rpg is that it allows you to create any 
type of character you can imagine. I currently need support to make this rpg 
happen. If you are intrested in playing in this rpg, E-mail me and say you 
want to play or ask questions. I will answer all questions.

Sammy picks up a vase holding a red carnation.  He rips the head off of it,
then tucks the flower into his formal jacket.  With a glance around him,
he brushes off his pants and puts on a pair of mirrored shades.
"Come on boys," he says, Motioning for some burly moogles wearing similar shades.

An imp kneels before Don Sammy, head of the moogle mafia.
"Oh, please, I was going to pay my taxes, but-"
Sammy held out his hand, adorned with expensive rings.
"Friend, friend," he mutters like sugar.  "No problem.  We hear the less fortunate."
"Oh, thank you, thank you!" the imp cries, kissing Sammy's polished shoes.
Sammy kicks him off and gestures to the moogles as he walks away.
As the moogles advance, and the imp screams, Don Sammy takes a puff of his
cigar, then squashes it on the ground with a cruel smile.

Absolutely.  Check out the excellent 'Wizards of the Coast' stuff on 
gods, deific power, and the super supplement 'Pawns'.  Now there is a way 
to make Origob _really frightening_.  Problem is this: no system, no

A friend has asked me to test this Beta version of a new web browser  for 
him and of course guess what the first place I went to was.
You may have also notiv\ced that I'm quite far behind with Realms of 
Wonder. It seems that Fred (Doro) needed back the Mac II that I have been 
using. I have a stack of disks and artwork including some stuff I've done 
in photoshop format that will really rock you! Unfortunately Idon't think 
I'll get any of it out for one to three weeks.
Martha Marion who I'm co-writing the Tirani'Kai stories with has been 
excited about the TekCon since David Cheng called me. I have started 
repairs on the MechaDragon costume and I have a Sro' dragon costume I 
made for a local SciFi Con. But I'll still put in an apperance as Havin.
The whole thing sounds wild. But after the scuttling of the 1990 TekCon I 
wish David the best of luck!!

Subject: Tekumel Convention
Newsgroups: alt.games.frp.tekumel
Distribution: world
Lines: 70

Some discussion of this follows a mass mailing regarding Cheng's
proposal for a Tekumel convention in 1997, and a mass e-mail reply.
Sorry I can't easily post the originals, but it seems appropriate
to shift the discussion to the newsgroup, assuming any one is
interested.

First, Cheng has demonstrated at least twice that he can run a
successful convention (RQ-con), and certainly knows how to budget.
Second, that it is the business of the organizers to decide what
profit is appropriate to whom.  In fact I would prefer it be a
profitable venture.  I was prepared to give money to Cheng for
RQ-Con II in San Francisco, and I think he is exactly the person
that can pull it off.

If Cheng wants to show us parts of his budget, that's fine, but
a business doesn't show its books to its customers, only its
investors.  Cheng is competent, I have no reason to distrust him.

As regards profit, so far there has been far too little of that
associated with Tekumel.  If neither Barker, his immediate associates,
or the publishers can make a profit, then the secondary sources
(players, former players and referees) have almost no incentive to
produce.  The hotel profits by the convention, and in my experience
most organizers at least hope to profit.

I suggest that Cheng has already proven himself as a manager, and
anyone who wants to work should volunteer.  Criticism is always
appropriate.

I agree that 1997 seems too far away, and also with the concerns
about the Professor's health.  However, I know from working with the
organizers of several Go Congresses that large scale events take
more than a year of planning.  For example, many convention sites
are just now locking in their rates, and some dates are reserved
more than a year in advance.  If it was too late for season of 96
(which it probably is), then season of 97 might be the next oppor-
tunity (season being whenever its best).

Alternately, the plan for the Live Action Role Playing is likely
to require an amazing amount of preparation, and the suggestion
that at alternative be considered is also sound.  Making Barker
and the Milwaukee Tekumel community available to third
generation players like myself would be worth the price of
admission, and take less preparation than a full scale LRP.
A more limited convention in 96 would be preparation for a LRP
next year.

How to profit Barker and the others: that is the question in
my mind.  I know, for example, that Barker has typewritten
manuscripts for Swords and Glory.  A limited production run
of these, autographed by Barker, with some additional material
(all of which Barker holds the copyright for), and illustrations,
could be sold.  Someone willing to fly to Minneapolis, or willing
to pay more than $50 for an original boxed EPT, can spend some money.
Otherwise, we wouldn't even be talking about a convention at all.
Probably Barker's buddies have an even better idea of what is
available.

As far as myself, I plan to attend.  I am too busy to be relied on
to organize, but I have paid for some Tekumel art for a module that
will not be published, so something might be made of this.  I would
be willing to pay for more art, especially if it increased the value
of something Barker produced.

Thanks for the info. I appreciate the e-mail address and I may even give
M.A.R. Barker a vote of confidence for his wonderful creation which I have
admired across the decades. I do fear however, for the fate of Tekumel if
items such as "Gardasiyal" become the standard to judge it by. Or perhaps
there will be nothing further forthcoming? One can only hope that interest
in Tekumel dies entirely rather than having it mutate into something which
it is not. I'm not sure which would be the best course...

Sincerely.

That is essentially true. GURPS & SJG products have a much better pipeline

We all want to see Tekumel suceed, but I doubt it ever will. First, a single
world book, is of little use to gain market share. Sure it may grab some
people's attention, and then its back to being "dead" again. The ONLY way
for Tekumel to be revivied is to have a CONTINUING flow of products for
Tekumel in the marketplace. These products have to have a high production 
standard to draw people's attention. Thus it will have to be produced by
an established, decently sized, gaming company, or by someone who has 
really deep pockets (several hundreds of thousands of dollars).

This line of products could go one of two ways. The first is a Universal
supplement approach. The entire series would be designed so that it could
be easily adapted to most RP-systems. Thieves World tried this and was
moderately succesfull. The second (and more promising) approach is to start
with, yet another, set of role-playing rules tied to the world of Tekumel.
These rules must be state of the art in both presentation and actual
rules-system. A nice overview of Tekumel should be included in such a package.

After this, both approaches merge. The first real product is a complete
re-write of The Tekumel Source Book (S&G Vol I). Lots of pictures, maps,
player aids, etc. Make it user friendly. This would give a very high 
overview of the world. Enough for gamers to start with. This would then
be followed by additional source books, based upon the major nations, and 
eventually finer detail of major cities / areas within these nations.
Pre-written adventures are a MUST product. It is the ONLY way a new GM 
will feel comfortable GM'ing such an alien world. You must have a new product
at least every quarter, if not every other month. The marketplace is driven
by new products.

Alas, this will not occur. First, Prof Barker has been bit too many times 
by various gaming companies (thank you very much T$R) and demands complete
control over all products involving the world of Tekumel. Secondly, no
gaming company will commit the necessary resources to a world that has
never really suceeded in twenty years of RP-existance. Third, and most 
importantly, Tekumel is TOO ALIEN for most people to get into it. If you
look at most of the succesfull FRP worlds, they are generally based upon
standard western fantasy, or they have some other hook that people can
relate too. Most people like the idea of "Good" vs "Evil", a concept that
really doesn't exist on Tekumel. Why do you think that all the RP games
have Elves, Dwarfs, Halflings, etc. All these "Non-Humans" are really humans
with slightly different backgrounds (and physical attributes). It is
mind-boggling to try and play an Ahoggya with 4 arms, 4 legs, 4 sets of eyes,
eight different sexes.... There is no frame of reference, and that makes
most people uneasy.

I'm rambling, (as usual), but I doubt that anything can be done to
serious revive the world of Tekumel. Its on life-support (I'm not dead
yet!) but we are in the 3rd release of a role-playing game for Tekumel, and
the amount of material surrounding it continues to dwindle. I'm glad that 
TOME has published Gardisayal (not neccarily pleased with the result) and 
has published some other material. I love Steve Foster's/Dave Morris' Eye
of All-Seeing Wonder (a true work of love). Several people on the Blue
Room mailing list are working to transcribe much of the now, unavailable 
Tekumel material so that it can live on, being published electronically.
I just don't think that a Tekumel revival will ever be succesfull. 
(Please prove me wrong, I'd love to see Tekumel revived.)

Oh Well, just my $.02

I think this is a great idea.  As an EPT player in my youth, and at the moment 
a GURPS GM, I think that it would be the best of both worlds, so to speak.   I 
agree that Prof. Barker should have complete editorial control.    If you are 
worried about the decline in Tekumel's popularity, it seems a good solution.  

 I stopped playing EPT because better sets of rules came along, and I've 
settled on GURPS.  I'll bet that there are a lot of people out there who would 
jump at the chance to visit (or revisit) Tekumel using rules they already 
know.

So, what can people like me do to support such an idea ???

Please, ramble on.  Your ramblings strike directly at the center of the
target.  Tekumel is unique and special, but altogether too different for
most gamers.
The only way it will receive the support it needs is if one of its chief
proponents becomes rich enough by other means to simply dump cash into it.
To that end, I have today sent off my FINAL ROUND Publisher's Clearing House
entry.  Since I am already a winner (it says so right here) you can look
for the Tekumel movie to premier in June, 1997...

The question of mechanics for honour is similar to the mechanics for traits
and passions in Pendragon.
Certain people enjoy the mechanic since it drives them to role play in a 
character, and yet others hate them.
I personally feel they can work if the effects are role played, but in the hands
of the wrong sort they become another mechanic. I hit the Ssu, I am honourable,
I climb the wall, I am sad.
I think both using them and not are valid, but with Tekumel I kinda feel
that the tight social mores mean I'd be more likely to use an Honour system.
I think the knack of being sneaky is being Honourable AND getting your own way.

 Although I do agree with some of the sentiments that have been directed 
towards Gardasiyal [esp: character generation] Iam not willing to condemn the 
whole game. My group enjoy the simplicity of Gardasiyal, and they [like myself]
enjoy the world of Tekumel enough that they are willing to overlook some 
discrepencies. Fortuneately I had a copy of the growing up on Tekumel book Vol1
so the option to roll up from scratch was available to my players. Perhaps 
this is why my group have not been opposed to using Gardasiyal. Prior to 
Gardasiyal we used the old EPT rules. One thing though I do wish that TOME 
would have done some editing prior to releasing the game, and that they would 
have included a table of contents!!
Evan.

Tekumel is not dead. With so much garbage on the market it is great to able to 
journey in a world as well thought out as Prof. Barkers world! The appeal of 
Tekumel is its great history and complexity, not what the game mechanics 
are like. Enough with the endless debate! Use what ever rules you are 
comfortable with, and lets get back to having fun. 

Evan.
 
P.S. Hopefully Lord Origob can bring some sense to those fools at TOME, and 
make them allow Prof. Barker to have the creative he wants and needs. I 
summoned him [Origob] the other day, and told him to put the fear of Hnalla 
into those TOME people. You know what demons are like (esp the big 'O'], he 
probably ate them or made a pair of slippers out of their hides.

Has anyone seen (either in print or on-line) an errata sheet for 
Gardasiyal? I'm still getting a little hung up on the discrepancies 
between the character generation book and Gardasiyal proper.

(Even so, Gardasiyal is the best set of Tekumel rules yet, IMHO).

Brett I have got your Tekumel Gurps stuff, and I respect your work in
this and other areas, but I actually feel GURPS is wrong for Tekumel.
I like and use GURPS, but I just feel that this one world where a bespoke
system is needed. Now you could use much of the GURPS system to build 
that new system, but magic and religion would make it more than true GURPS.
I kinda feel the same with RQ, (or Basic Role Playing), you could build 
Tekumel out of one of the Chaosium games, but again you need to resolve
magic and religion. RQ might be a little better for religion, but straight
RQ cults wouldn't be quite right.

I guess what I'm kinda saying is that Tekumel is one of the few excpetions 
where I think that using another system will do fine for a while, but that
in the long run it will become Tsolyanu.

(And I do include Gardasyal in that, not for specific-ness but poor rule
structure, happy and delighted as I am that it is published)

I must download Tirikelu now..

Locally, the prices are about half what you charge,
and I have to pick it up.   

No big deal, considering the 50% discount I get
for doing that!!!!!

Most people stumble over the truth, now and then, but they
usually manage to pick themselves up and go on, anyway.

Ah, but you've got to figure in some extra value to this dude's offer.

He spams the net.  You buy his tree for twice what it's worth.  He 
delivers the tree.  You express your gratitude appropriately.

And, after you've got the damn tree jammed up his ass, just have a couple 
of buddies help you hoist it.

*sigh*  I know I know.  Mitlanyal is sitting here on my hard drive.
I'm working on incorporating a long interview concerning the Temple of
Belkhanu into the Belkhanu chapter -- I transcribed it last summer.

Never expect Mitlanyal soon.  Eventually it will come, but I'm long past
making any estimates as to when.

Yeegh, that is scary.  You've touched very close upon the fate of one of
my characters.  Arjai hiVaisoner was killed once, and his skin is a
wall-decoration 
in the private cabin of Lady Sarvodaya aboard her Ship of the Ancients.

This is rather frustrating for Arjai, as his body was not recovered.
His bakte, hlakme and whatever other bits were "canned" and eventually
ensconsed in a body "borrowed" from an Engsvanyali fisherman.

If he could ever get into Sarvodaya's cabin with an eye of revivification
and an assistant, he could probably get into his old body again.  He'd
have to allow
his assistant to kill him, then revivify the original body.  There's the
chance that it wouldn't work, and Sarvodaya would simply end up with two
skins from the same person on her wall.  Or that it would work, but
Sarvodaya would track him down and kill him for it.  Or that he might not
have the nerve to let himself be killed to try it, even if he had the
opportunity.

This is one trivial example of why one should not mess with, annoy, or
even come to the attention of the Undying Wizards such as Sarvodaya.
