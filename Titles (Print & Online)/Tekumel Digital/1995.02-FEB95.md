        The reason we all like tekumel is that we're all obsessive, 
psychotics who take a peverse desire in following a game who's system was 
abysmal by 80's standards, who's support material is cursed to be stolen, 
burnt, sunk etc, and whose background is so deep that only the author 
dares actually run the game.......
        Then of course every time I open the Swords and Glory Box, I get 
a buzz just like that I had the first time I opended my DMG to see what 
this role-playing lark was all about. Every time I delve into the Source 
book I find a new and fascinating titbit about Tsolyani life I'd never 
noticed before, I might be an obsessive fruitcake but I've reason to be.
        Course it'd be nice if I Could actually play some EPT some time 
before 2000 !! but never mind.

        For a while now several of us have been rambling on about someone 
running an Email campaign, and to be honest I think it'd be a great idea 
and I too would love to play, Do pigs fly south for the winter.
        But in that I have more free time than I know what to do with I 
would probably be willing to run such a thing, someones got to.
        However I am new to this Internet/Email lark ( I am currently 
using my flatmates access)and as such am kind of perplexed as to how on 
earth ( or Tekumel) you run an Email campaign by Email. So if somone 
gives me a run down on how they think it should work then I'll take a 
view.

        Then again I have played a few PBM r.p.g's and one suspects the 
medium is fairly similar. I always remember PBM RPG's as suffering from 
chronic interparty co-operation, evryone doing there own thing, so 
perhaps some sort of politically based campaign where the players 
represent various influential figures whose actions influence other 
players but who are not directly associated with the other players. I 
don't know if any of you are familiar with a PBM called Delenda est 
Carthago but perhaps something with a similar sort of style.

        Yours Rich

P.S Once upon a time there was talk of an official Tekumel PBM, Gateway 
to Tekumel, Did anyone ever send off for the setup ? What was the premise 
of play ??

More |  Right, I now have a vague plot structure for a low fantasy 
semi-political campaign (none of this gallavanting round Avanthar) based 
on some stuff I was playing around with a couple of years back. The 
campaign would be centered on the City of The Dead ( A nic source of 
unpleasentness) and the various factions would be split amongst the Tomb 
police, The Tomb Robbers, the adherants of Lord Sarku and those of lord 
Belkhannu and the other gods, the Clans of the Open Sepulchre, The Black 
Stone Tomb clan, The  Nighted tower and the odd passer by.
        The PC's would be big fish in this scummy pond, The Kasi's of the 
Tomb police, Priests of the 7th-8th circles, the Huathu of the Clans.....
        Pressure would come from above with Dhich'une's assension to make 
the worship of Sarku predominant and to take control of the Underworld 
and incidently to make the lives of the PC's horrible...

        Anyway, any comments
        
        Rich

Yes, this was a short lived PBM run by the late Curtis Scott. The
premise was that each person had their own little campaign. At least,
that's how my set up was. I sent him a character based on his rules
and we just started playing. I'm sure that the characters would
end up in the same campaign, but from appearances, I couldn't tell.
I only got one turn completed before the game ended.

I can't answer your question about Ditlana, but not everyone gets a 
huge tomb in the City of the Dead. Only important personalities do.
Most of the population isn't treated this way.

Jakalla has been occupied since at least the City-States of the Triangle.
I'd say more like 30,000 years. It was probably occupied before that.
After all, Jakalla is the 'City Half as Old as the World'.

Part of the reason is that the actual location of the cities drifts over
the millenia. The current city of the Dead is located over old parts of 
Jakalla. And those pesky priest keep digging down to get to their old
temples and holy sites.

Wow this Usenet business is a royal pain in the arse isn't it? Roll on the
day when everyone will get sensible and use e-mail...

This is to answer a few quries about how a game might work over e-mail.
While I don't run a PEBM game I do run a PBM game and the central tenats
are similar.

Firstly Don't expect any dice rolling in the game, it's more like writing
a story with the player providing the motivations of one character in the
whole of the book. Dice rolling (if it occurs) is done out of sight by the
GM and the only clue that anything has happened is through the text of the
reply.

Each turn can be considered a chapter in a book written by two co-authors

If anyone else is looking, Half-Price Books in Richardson, Texas, no

a small "carrying charge") to the first one who asks (when I'm done

Well, for anyone who cares, in Minneapolis MN, Uncle Hugo's Science
Fiction Bookstore usually has copies of these books. They also
carry all the new TOME products. And for $2, you can get a 10% off
discount card.  I'm planning on getting one when Gardasiyal comes
out.  They are good for about 2 months.

I ordered a sample of their wares back last year and found them rather
good.  Any word on new or previously incomplete figures (e.g., command,
priests, etc.)? Any chance this line might include other types of figures
(civvies, "monsters", chlen, etc.)?

Sorry, nothing new so far. The real world has intruded upon production of new
figures. Shen and Hlaka remain in unfinished states.

As far as civilian stands go, they are very far down the line, with the
exception of chlen to pull carts (for baggage). 

We are continuing to develop our miniatures rules though. This despite the 
fact that we've heard nothing from TOME.

First Question: is anyone located in the metro DC area running or
considering a Tekumel campaign?  I have gotten back into RPGing after an
absence of many years and am "educating" (proselytizing?) my friends in
the tales of the Petal Throne.

Second Question:  what material on using GURPS with Tekumel was someone
referring to in an earlier but recent post?  I must have missed this; is
it in the FAQ?

Thanks!  Jan

Probably referring to the latest(?) issue of Pyramid. It had an excellent
12-17 page article on running Tekumel using the GURPS rules. It was written
by Brett Slocum, who pops up here pretty often. Well worth picking up for that.

The new rules should be out in the next couple months. Last I heard, (last
week), the only thing left to complete was the map. I could see it hitting
the stores in March - April time frame.  Certainly sooner than Origins or
GenCon. The new rules are called Gardasiyal: Deeds of Glory. They will be
cheaper than what you'd have to pay someone to part with the Swords and
Glory rules.

Just my $2.

A zipped version for PCs will be made available as time permits.

Also, look for my GURPS Tekumel rules RSN, in the same
location. I'll post the latest FAQ soon, as well. The new
FAQ is already available via WWW at the home page below
(or from Bob's Tekumel home page on wings.network.com).

        As an Email campaign, the campaign will centre on the power 
politics of PC and NPC interactions based on the following concepts :

        1) Objectives
                ‘To explore new possibilities for adventure in the 
classic setting of the underworld.’ Through the campaigns association 
with the classical ‘dungeons’, it will be possible for newcomers to get a 
handle on the campaign. But to offer a more modern outlook on 
adventuring, the campaign will concentrate on the political aspects and 
intrigues associated with the underworld.

        2) History
                The campaign is based on a tabletop, alternative ‘dungeon 
bash’, I put together in 1992, in two distinct parts. The first involved 
a group of tomb robbers, who successfully rob a tomb only to get shaken 
down by the tomb police on the way out. the second part then involved a 
group of tomb police whose life ambition turned into the persecution of 
tomb robbers (players are odd like that). There ambitions somewhat 
complicated by crooked intrigues from their political masters.

        3) Ambitions
                The players will take control of individuals who are 
powerful in the hierarchy of the city of the dead, and will be faced with 
plots, intrigues and murder. As such the players will need to plot and 
scheme amongst themselves  to survive. Over time the players input will 
hopefully shape the campaign and thus generate insidious plot, making the 
poor GM’s life easier.

As a loyal follower of Chiteng, I resent your implication that killing,
burning (especially burning), and plundering do not represent a greater
world concern or express true loyalty.  I demand shamtla for this slight!
(unless you would like to settle this grievance with the weapons of
warriors, rather than the pens of court scribes...)

                The nervous Tirrikanu crossed the courtyard, beneath the 
dark looming presence of the temple of Sarku, mounting the stairs to the 
squat building that was the headquarters of the tomb police, Without 
pausing to reflect upon the absence of guards, or any tomb police, he 
approached the office of the most exalted and honourable Kasi of the 
Tsurum of the city of the dead.
         His Tsolyani instincts cried outrage to observe the broken 
portions of a meshqu plaque littering the outer office, the deep purple 
pieces perhaps from the plaque of indefinable sorrow of the 16 ‘simple’ 
meshqu of common usage.         From inside raised voices seemed to 
conflict such a judgement, more likely the broken meshqu was indicative 
of the plaque of the fiery voice of immediate anger, But bearing

buried. But not to rest in peace, for throughout there underground vaults

        Lacking anything decent in the way of rules for EPT, I’m going to 
avoid the problem by using as few as possible. I might translate across 
to the new ones when they come out depending what they’re like. The 
character generation process is a two step process and you don’t get step 
II till you’ve done step I so there. Beyond what limited stats there are 
I’ll also need Names + Lineage’s, suggested lineage history, personal 
history, a complete personality profile (so I’ll know how you react), 
descriptions and anything else you can think of. Also as a lot of the 
action will be investigative you’ll need to flesh out your friends, 
colleagues and contacts but wait till part II for that.

        1) Archetypes / Stereotypes
                Given the initial direction the campaign is going, select 
a role from the following list
                        Officer of the Tomb Police
                        Tomb Robber
                        Priest of Sarku
                        Priest of Belkhannu
                        Clan Elder
                The campaign will need a certain number of Officers of 
the Tomb police ( at least 2) and players should express a preference for 
clan, though it will probably be necessary to edit it. Choose clan from :
                        Clan of the Open Sepulchre
                        Clan of the Black Stone Tomb
                        Clan of the Nighted Tower

        2) Characteristics
                Characteristics range from Brilliant to Awful (through 
V.Good, Good, Average, Poor & V.Poor) and as such the following 
characteristics must be assigned a level :
                        Strength
                        Intelligence
                        Dexterity,
                        Constitution,
                        Pedhetl                         Appearance
                Beginning characters start with once characteristic at 
Brilliant, two characteristic at good, two characteristics at average (or 
below) and one characteristic at poor (or below).

        3) Talents
                Each character has at least one talent, beginning 
characters should choose one talent for themselves either from the list 
or a talent they feel is valid and they are prepared to justify.
                Psychic
                Ritual Aptitude
                Athletic
                Artistic
                Martial
                Academic
                Outdoorsman
                Mercantile
                Diplomatic

        4) Magic
                Notes, in order to be able to use Psychic magic a 
character must have a talent for Psychic magic, in order to use Ritual 
magic an above average intelligence and a above average Pedhetl is 
required, though a Ritual aptitude helps. For a character to be a Psychic 
dampener he needs a Psychic talent (dampener see Part II) and an awful 
Pedhetl.

        5) Skills
                Notes, skills will be allocated on the basis of 
profession (4-5 skills) , general interests (2 skills) and a hobby see 
Part II.

                When you have a name and have the details above sorted 
out give us a line

        As of the 14th day of Firasul 2364AS, Jakalla

        Up until a six night ago, Jakalla’s city of the dead has been 
patrolled by a Tsurum of tomb police, of the Clan of the Open Sepulchre. 
Like most Tsurum of the tomb police, this was really but an oversize 
Kareng with no more than 150-200 Changadesha, but the extra officers 
helped with the patrolling of the Underworld and offered more prestige to 
the Clan of the Open Sepulchre.
        Like most cities the burial grounds of Jakalla have been beset by 
thieves and tomb robbers. Some of the tomb robbers are organised into 
gangs and companys to match the tomb police, mainly made up of brethren 
of the Clan of the Nighted Tower but also a number of disreputable 
foreigners (Jakalla has been traditionally been plagued by ignorant 
foreigners & immigrants). Traditionally however an understanding has 
existed between the tomb police and the tomb robbers, which was rewarding 
to both and avoided confrontations.
        However two nights ago, a Semetl of the tomb police discovered 
some recent excavations in the upper gallery of the outer halls of the 
tomb of Famuel the astrologer. Beneath the three faces of the gateway to 
the astrologers tomb, a pit had been dug, uncovering an even older 
stairwell adorned with inscriptions in ever enduring praise to the 
glories of the worm and the Emperor Durumu Tlakotani.
        Believing this to be an entrance to the collapsed tomb of Nikuma 
III and a major treasure find, the Tirrikamu petitioned for the rest of 
his Kareng to be assembled, as a show of force to encourage the tomb 
robbers to come to an equitable solution.       On the third Tenmrekh 
after dawn the returning tomb robbers struck from ambush, Killing many of 
the Kareng’s Changadesha in the first few moments. As desperate 
reinforcements rushed to the battle the tide was beginning to turn until 
with most of the tomb polices Tsurum in the gallery a terrorising shriek 
shattered the gallery crumbling the roof as some abominable, loathsome, 
gibbenous horror arose from the depths of the underworld, rending both 
tomb robbers and tomb police alike with frightening glee, laying waste 
all around until both the forces of policeman and robbers lay shattered 
and dying.
        With the tsurum of the tomb police decimated, down to maybe 25 
men, and the forces of the tomb robbers shattered beyond recovery 
(probably) the situation looks bleak.

My guess is that some 10,000  copies were produced, maybe more. It was very
heavily promoted when it was released in 1976 (I still remember its $25 list
price). So the orginal EPT isn't that rare, uncommon yes, but not rare. I 
estimate the street value at $50-$100 depending upon condition, despiration of
buyer and seller, etc.

I'd like to give it a try, as either a Priest of Belkhanu or an officer

Hello,
	I have always been intrugued with Prof. Barker's world ever
since I breifly played in a game in the late '70s using the first rule
set. In the intervening time I have been very involved in writing
roleplaying games, from my own campaign. But everytime I look back at
EPT I see this excellent worl, rich in history and tradition, but
saddled with an older, first generation rule system.

	How does one get hold of Prof Barker? The idea of joining my
rules sytem, which has over 1200 playtest sessions, with his excelent
background seems very attractive. But the various people I have
attempted to contact to lead back to him have been ineffective at
accomplishing this. Can anyone give me a lead here?

As an AoL user, I am only a novice in the use of FTP.  Perhaps someone can
advise me:  I downloaded a number of files from the location cited and an
Unzip utility, assuming that was what the .Z suffix indicated.  However,
whatever way I attempt to read them, they all come out as a series of tiny
inverted "v" symbols.  Help!

Someone is missing the point!  As a follower of the Reaper of Cities, I
acknowledge no such thing as "unnecessary violence"!  To do proper and
devout service to the Lord of Red Spouting Flame, I follow the road of war
and seek to spread confusion, sorrow, fear, and terror amidst my enemies
by all means at my disposal.  Thus are the precepts of the Drinker of
Blood and the other Lords of Change to be pursued; to do other wise would
be for me (no shrinking slave of Dra) ignoble.

Ah, this is not a Zip file. It is a compressed file, using the
Unix 'compress' utility.  I haven't yet put a zipped version up.
I'm surprised your Unzip program even let you make the attempt.
It should have recognized that it wasn't a Zip file.
I will post when a zipped version is up in that FTP area.

Hmmm, no promises that he will respond, but if you send me a letter to him
I'll see that he gets it.  He is right now working through Tome to have a
3rd edition rules set published.

I spoke with TOME Monday, and they said the only thing holding release up
was the map.  They expect it to be done within a week or so.  They are taking
pre-release orders, and offering 20% off on those orders (when ordering the
whole set:  apparently you can order the pieces individually).  I ordered
the set and it came to something like 35 bucks (as opposed to 45).  I am
looking forward to receiving it.

        The point here, is not to come with a traditional type group with 
characters who compliment each other. From the PBM's I've played such 
things never work out as some sod never gets his stuff in on time. The 
idea is for characters to operate idedependantly, and interact as 
individuals trying to achieve opposing objectives.
        Given that the orginal idea was for a campaign based around the 
hierachily structure of the Tomb Police, and so far most people want to 
play priests, frustrated witness's that they are, we need a few 
characters from the other stereotypes. So far I've got a pretty good 
Belkhanu character, and sketches for a Sarku priest and a Tomb police 
officer. But I need at least one or two more strong tomb police players 
as thats where the pointed end of the action is likely to be.
        Now I know I ain't posted much recently but the bank where I work 
just went bust so I've been a bit busy..

                Yours Rich

        At the moment, for this Email campign all the PC's have gone for 
the Clan of the Open Sepulchre. Now in that I have a bundle of NPC's 
already generated, to avoid the clan changing its name to the clan of a 
hundread lineages, I have posted what passes for my current compilation 
of clan stuff for this clan alone.      This is in no way complete, or 
even semi complete, as half the stuff I've come up with is still 
scribbled on the back of an envelope, and the other half, from my 
tabletop campaign seems to have gone missing.   Theres no reason why you 
have to come from one of the lineages below but please think twice before 
making a new one up, and if you do, try to avoid calling it something 
beginning with the letter 't'.

        THE CLAN OF THE OPEN SEPULCHRE

Status : Low

S&G Description (revised) : Embalmers, tomb guards, and professional 
mourners ; primarily devoted to Belkhanu and his cohort Qol, but also to 
Sarku and Durritlamish ; found all over the empire.

Lineages :      Barasa (Low)

                Onelusa (High), Descended from the dark hero Onelusa who 
in the time of the usurpers (c1699AS) gathered a horde of undead to 
destroy an army which was ruthlessly laying waste to Jakalla’s city of 
the dead to plunder its treasures to pay the troops. Known as a dark hero 
as his actions resulted in tge shattering of the concordant and much of 
Jakalla proper in the ensuing priestly conflict. Reportedly ‘lives’ on in 
some dark tomb, sentenced to receive the homage of all the mu’ur (undead) 
of the underworld, a task he is still at, nigh on a 1000 years later, 
unable to refuse their homage without                   dishonour.

                Stirai (Low)

                Seremakh (Medium), An ambitious lineage fast on its way 
towards improving its status.

                Tektasthe (Medium), The lineage is primarily responsible 
for the clan's record-keeping and administrative services, and as such, 
its members are often literate and able to keep figures.

                Thanadu (High)

                Tlakfan (Low), A mixed lineage of native Tsolyanu and 
Fatlen (foreigners ) with little status within the clan but more personal 
wealth than other lineages.

                Tlekaryal (Medium), A small lineage almost universly 
devoted to Sarku.

                Tukkolen (High)

Finally as to the lineges of the campigns clans, all the clans are of low 
or very low status. Brett and I have been discussing whether or not such 
lineages deserve the -hi- and whether such clans even have lineage names 
at all.         For the sake of the flavour of Tsolyanu naming, use the 
-hi-, and give characters a lineage name but please if you're going to 
flesh out you're lineage (and I would encorage you to do so) try to make 
it  something scummy.   A proper lineage should be descended from an epic 
hero from the battle of dormoron fields, but you don't rate a proper 
lineage ,so instead you're descended from some other vaguley important 
figure probablly from the recent history of the second imperium.
        to end with certain people have had difficulty getting all the 
alt stuff I've posted so to help you keep track I'll start numbering 
everything this is broadcast no 7
