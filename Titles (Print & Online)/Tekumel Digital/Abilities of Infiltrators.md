432. Abilities of Infiltrators

Infiltrators, called yagurétokh in Tsolyánu, are imperial, provincial, clan or legion clandestine agents. They investigate, interrogate, pass unseen, employ coded communications, shadow and evade, and eventually build a network of people to help accomplish their masters’ aims.

Literacy (Modern Tsolyáni)

This is the skill of reading and writing in the Imperial Monumental Script and in the cursive Visúmikh hiKólumel script mandated currently for all official uses. This skill is especially geared to imitate standard bureaucratic prose. Its purpose is to open opportunities for cyphering, forgery and the creation of cover identity documents.

Basic Talent(s): Intelligence, Dexterity

LoSS: Cursive – 13; Monumental – 11

Imperial Etiquette

This skill teaches the infiltrator all about imperial protocols, upper-class codes-of-conduct, forms of address, palace behavior, current events, important personalities, religious rivalries, political machinations, etc. It is primarily used to modify rolls governing NPC reactions, especially those in connection to the above list of situations. At level-I through level-IV, this skill gives a +1 bonus to rolls on the Nonplayer Character Reaction Table (Sec. 1020); at level-V through level-VII a +2 bonus to rolls is gained; at level-VIII and level-IX, a +3 bonus to rolls; and, finally, at level-X a +4 bonus to rolls.

Basic Stealth Techniques

This skill establishes the infiltrator’s basic ability to track and shadow targets. At first, it develops awareness, surreptitiousness, and use of tactics and teams. At level-I through level-IV, it yields a +1 to shadowing. At level-V through level-VII, it grants a +2. At level-VIII and level-IX, it yields a +3. At level-X it grants a +4.

LoSS: Track Non-Alert Target – 15; Track Alerted Target – 11

Tools and Devices

This skill teaches the infiltrator all about the material equipment upon which his life depends. Obviously, each tool and device type is a different field of study, but at middle levels of experience we’re talking about climbing and clinging claws, lock and window tools, and trap disabling devices. Benefits by referee agreement.

Assassination Techniques

This skill hones the infiltrator’s killer instinct. At first it develops alertness, targets-of-opportunity, reaction time, and decisiveness. At level-V through level-VII, it allows the infiltrator’s player to asks questions of the referee such as: “How many hit points does my target have?” At level-VIII through level-IX, it permits the rules in Section 731 Double Damage and Instant Death to change. The infiltrator achieves a critical hit upon ALL roles of 20 and above on “to hit” dice (i.e., a “natural 20” is not needed; if an infiltrator’s “to hit” chances are +5 due to a variety of bonuses, he scores Double Damage on any 20-sided die read of 15 and above). At level-X the assassin does double maximum damage when landing a critical hit.

Detect/ Disable Traps

This profession of infiltrator demands great situational awareness. At first, this skill builds alertness, trap recognition, reaction time, and commitment. At level-I through level-IV, it yields a +1 to trap detection and disabling. At level-V through level-VII, it grants a +2. At level-VIII and level-IX, it yields a +3 to trap detection and disabling. At level-X it grants a +4. The skill also allows a default detection of nearby secret doors, but at half the benefit. It also imparts a very limited knowledge of the tsuru'úm beneath Béy Sý and its city of the dead.

LoSS: Detect Traps – 07; Navigate Underworld – 07

Advanced Stealth Techniques

This skill hones the infiltrator’s ability to pass unseen. At first, it develops suppleness, noise cancellation, and use of obstacles and shadows. At level-I through level-IV, it yields a +1 to stealth. At level-V through level-VII, it grants a +2. At level-VIII and level-IX, it yields a +3. At level-X it grants a +4. This skill also allows a default control of self (as per that skill) but at the normal half benefit.

LoSS: Enter Non-Alert Palace – 15; Enter Alerted Palace – 11

Control of Self

This skill trains the infiltrator in the superhuman control of his own body. The agent’s breath can be held indefinitely. His heartbeat can be stopped. An object can be held by the infiltrator for a long period with a steel-hard grip. A trance can be entered, allowing multiple attacks and precognitive parries. Total memory recall can be had. The senses blocked. Impossible tasks, of course, cannot be accomplished, but it is almost impossible for foes to defeat this control. Example: someone trying to tear away the grip of one under the influence of this skill would consult the Likelihood of Spell Success Table, using Strength instead of Psychic Ability as the modifier.

Preternatural Senses

The profession of infiltrator allows a character to sense danger and immanent violence when first seeing from a short distance, and when first entering, a place, group of people, or situation. Preternatural Senses channels through the infiltrator a god-like awareness, thereby allowing him or her to anticipate ambushes, recognize walking into traps, sense (even in darkness) the nearness of enemies, and even to detect invisible presences.

Secret Society

This skill represents the infiltrator’s ability to gain admittance into a political or religious secret society (such as the Sword of Righteousness Society or the dreaded Ndálu Clan). This clandestine organization then underwrites the infiltrator’s continued mastery of his art. The secret society employs the infiltrator in missions, trains him, gifts high quality (even steel or enchanted) tools and weapons, uses its contacts to arrange cover identities, gadgets, and even henchmen for operational use.

The benefits to the infiltrator are experience, money, weapons, devices, henchmen, etc. The infiltrator also gains an increase in experience points, a per Section 610. An infiltrator with a prime requisite of 15 – 17 adds 5% to his acquired experience points; that of 18 – 19 adds 10%; that of 20 adds 15% instead of the default boost ruled in the section cited.

Ultimate Disguise

All of the above skills combine to assist the infiltrator in developing totally impenetrable disguises. A target’s own mother would take the infiltrator for her beloved child. The yagurétokh subtly alters his or her very features and voice to impersonate whomever they desire, so long as they have had time to observe their mark. Trickery, well-spoken lies, mind-affecting chemicals are all possible adjuncts to this ability.

Master of the Skein of Destiny

This quasi-mystical ability simulates the infiltrator’s mastery of chance and timely good luck. Often this causes the infiltrator to emerge from certain death scratch-free. The infiltrator gains a new basic talent called Skein of Destiny. This talent is determined by rolling 1d20 and recording the result on the infiltrator’s character sheet. Anyone with an Excellent result gains 3 die rerolls per game session; one with a Superior result gains 2 rerolls; one with an Above Average result gains 1. Additionally, one with a result below average grants the referee 1 die reroll; an Inferior result, 2 referee die rolls; and a Execrable result, 3.
