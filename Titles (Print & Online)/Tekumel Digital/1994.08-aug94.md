The flaw revealed in this question is the presumption of any strategy at all.

;-)

I believe the basic idea to the release of the gamebooks before the rules
is 1) the desire to get something simple out, which could function as a 
stand-alone game and also convey the "flavor" of Tekumel to new buyers.
2) the fact that rewriting the rules was going to (and did) take a long
time, and involved a lot of playtesting and rewriting.  I don't know enough
about game-rules to say how successful the final product will be.

>From  my own point-of-view, writing a compilation volume of the religions of
Tekumel, even simply the twenty gods of Pavar's Pantheon, has taken a 
rediculous amount of time.

Of course, one major factor slowing this process is that 1) nobody involved 
is a professional writer with the exception of Phil Barker himself, 2) nobody
involved is being paid up-front, and this includes the artists, the people
laying out the prducts at the printers, nobody.  So there's only so much
you can do to "hurry" people who are working in their spare time, without
contractual agreements, without pay.

It also has to do with the fact that when Tekumel first
came out the people involved (Barker et al) set deadlines
on things and did what had to be done to meet those deadliones
even if that meant a product that wasn't all thgat great.

No, the people invoilved with the respective products are doing them
because thay like to do them and are taking the time to make sure they are good.
The rules system took so long because the Tuesday night group felt they
needed more playtest time.  The Temple book is taking time because
Bob wants to make it as complete as possible and is combing
every piece of material for references  including interviews taped
back in the early 80s.

For all of us working on products it is now less of a make money deal as it is a labor of love.
I know that for mytself if money is made, it will be gravey.

Bye the way, I hate this new terminal program.

  G-01: What is Tekumel?

  A-01: (Theron Goudeau; I copied this from rec.games.frp.misc a while ago)

Okay, a (not really) brief description of Tekumel:  Tekumel was discovered
by explorers from HumanSpace about 60,000 years after Christ.  There was a 
terrible nuclear war on Earth sometime around the present date, and the
European nations and the U.S. and China were destroyed.  South America,
the Indian subcontinent, and the Middle East (for some reason) survived
(no mention is made in the brief intro of Africa) survived, and gradually
rebuilt and became a world state of sorts, and humanity spread to the stars,
using miraculously high technology (FTL ships--the "Three-Light Drive," 
contragravity, beam weapons, superdense alloys, androids, and power systems
which poked holes in the continuum and drew near-limitless energy through
>from  n-dimensional space).  Tekumel was a large world, but had a lighter core
and a lower density.  It was home to acidic native life forms, several of
which were sentient and had even attained early spaceflight.  Humans, and   
their alien allies, conquered the natives and terraformed the planet, making
its ecosystem very Earthlike and installing massive gravity engines which
gave it an Earthlike day and year and 1.0G.  Tekumel was situated on a major
trade route, and became a mercantile pleasure world, which had to import
metals and industrial goods for the very rich who lived there.

Then Something Bad <tm> happened.

Apparently, through unknown agency, Tekumel and its entire star system fell
into a pocket dimension.  Gravitic stresses nearly tore the planet apart,
and destroyed many cities and installations.  Interstellar trade was immediate-
ly and permanently severed.  The native races, who'd been confined in prison-
like "reservations," broke free and made war.  Civilization fell rather
messily, and the Time of Darkness descended.

Sometime after the disaster, human scientists/philosophers (perhaps aided by
the some of the more psychically-gifted nonhumans) discovered that in the new
dimension, the power of the human mind alone, unaided by technology, could
draw power through from extra-dimensional space, and "magic" developed.
The sorcerors of the ancient Empire of Llyan of Tsamra mapped nexi between
various dimensions and made pacts with various dwellers of other planes,
called "demons" by the unitiated.  Great empires rose and fell over the next
30,000 years;  the presence of "magic" (really psychic phenomena), along 
with the obvious superiority (and near-complete inscrutability) of the
sciences of the Ancients (whose technology was largely irreparable due to
a lack of necessary raw materials) led to a stagnation of the sciences, and
to societies which depended largely upon tradition, precedent, and the bonds
of family and clan for stability.

Contact was also made with a race of extremely powerful beings who were for
all human purposes gods.  These beings subtly encouraged human worship and
dependence;  great unchanging religious bureaucracies developed, and after
several millenia of religious warfare, the temples agreed upon a Concordat
which disallowed open religious conflict, which further exaggerated the
Tekumelani tendency toward stagnation.  The people of Tekumel lack the
anthropocentric belief that the universe is knowable and conquerable;  they
know that there are races and beings which dwarf them in power, and that
there are sorceries and sciences which are far beyond their grasp; intellectual
and scientific curiousity is rare and even subtly discouraged.

As a result of these historical processes, there exist upon the face of the
great primary continent of the northeastern hemisphere of Tekumel the Five
Empires, all of which are monarchical/theocratic oligarchies in which
precedent and tradition hold the strength of law, and many smaller states
which balance themselves between two or more of their larger neighbors.  There
are small enclaves of nonhuman races, most of whom owe allegiance to a human
empire, and several states ruled by the inimical races, who still hate
humanity and its allies with a passion, but are outnumbered by the more
fecund invaders.  The Five Empires (one of which is the titular Empire of the
Petal Throne, Tsolyanu) have technology about on the level of the European
Renaissance (aqueducts, good roads, simple mechanics, wheeled carts, siege
engines, crude surgery and slightly more advanced pharmacology, crossbows,
water clocks, etc.).  Their governments are greatly hidebound and bureaucratic,
like those of ancient China.  They have mighty, well-organized legions like
those of the Romans.  Their gods are like those of the Hindus, with a heavy
dose of the bloodthirsty Aztec or Mayan deities.  Their legal codes and
sciences are much like those of the Arab philosophers of the Middle Ages;
they are obsessed with personal and family honor much like the medieval
Japanese.  The societies presented with the game are very intricate and
very old (the youngest governments are some 2,500 years developed, and they
have histories, traditions, and myths stretching back some 25,000 years).
Professor M.A.R. Barker, the author of the game, is a full professor of
linguistics and anthropology;  he has developed scripts, languages (and I
mean a language one can speak, with a grammar handbook and lexicon, like
Tolkien's Elvish or Roddenberry's Klingon, in the case of Tsolyani), histories,
modes of dress, etiquettes, architectural styles, weapons and armor, religions,
legal codes, demographics, sciences, etc. for all of the major and most of the
minor cultures.

Since the societies are so intricate and formal, political maneuvering and
subtlety, combined with the right amount of heroic action and appropriate
posturing, are the keys to power, and my campaign, as well as that of
Professor Barker himself from reports, thus deal mostly with intrigue and
plotting between the various power groups, combined with expeditions after
some bit of lost knowledge or some sorcerous object from an ancient tomb (yes,
dungeoncrawling!!!).  There are bits and pieces of ancient technology which
still function (many are self-repairing within limits, others have been
maintained carefully by human and nonhuman sages, or by robot servitors);
these are fought over as powerful tools.  The game's scope is very grand;
the Tekumelani do everything *BIG*.  There are mighty legions of thousands
of soldiers wearing brightly-laquered armor, wearing great Kheshchal-plumes,
and beating huge KarengKoreng war drums, sorcerors calling on terrible
demons with secret names, giant pyramidal temples thousands of years old
upon which hundreds of war-captives are sacrificed to the Lord of Flame, etc.
Tekumelani culture is very baroque, with titles like Reader of the Peerless
Scrolls of Martial Glory, huge statues of the 97th Aspect of Lady Avanthe,
Tanule the Patron of Lovers, and twenty-three forms of the pronoun "you,"
to be used when speaking to individuals of varying status and profession!

Overall, the gameworld is quite alien to traditional FRP gamers (which I
happen to think is a good thing, but that's me).  Many people feel that it's
*too* strange, and can't be run by anyone but Barker.  I know that my gamers,
a very traditional sword-and-sorcery blood-and-thunder bunch, at first
found the difficulty of Tekumelani pronunciation and the lack of comfortable
stereotypes like barbarian, wizard, elf, orc, and dragon, to be disconcerting,
but after two years of gaming on Tekumel they like it a lot, and use
Tekumelani terms to describe *other* games and situations.  It takes some
getting used to, and a good bit of homework on the part of the GM, but if
you're looking for a gameworld that is unique, interesting, and very well-
thought-out and developed, give Tekumel a go, it's cool.  It's much better
than _Cats_.  You will play it again and again.

  G-09: Do I have to use [insert rule system] to play a Tekumel game?

  A-09: Well, since their are currently three 'official' rule systems
        for Tekumel, I'd say a most definate 'No'. I've played using
        Runequest, Chivalry and Sorcery, Traveller, GURPS and Barker's
        "I don't need rules" style. I've heard of people using AD&D,
        Rolemaster, and several home-grown rule sets. So, the important
        thing is to play in the world, not what rules you use. (Brett
        Slocum)

Out of curiosity which group has stopped being run by Mr. Barker? The
rules heavy or rules light one? And was the reason, the time commitment
or some else entire?

Greetings All!

True enough Brett, I don't understand how it could take that long either.
Possible explanations are that the rep I spoke to did not know what
exactly was happening (if he was a wargamer vs. a rounded person that did
work in both areas) or that the company is small (which it is) and is
spacing products due to inventory, cash, etc.

I tend to lean towards the lack of knowledge theory. Although I had
receved a flyer from TOME stating that the deity book (whose name escapes
me at the moment) would be out in summer of 1994, this gent had no
knowledge of it being ready. So...

material...  but takes for ever to get into the book's format)."

Well--please see my previous response!

The novel is almost done???? Can you give us details (even really vague)
to whet our appetites? Will DAW publish it? Will Whelan do the cover?

Sigh. I remember spotting the first one in a book store and waking the
rather sleepy college bookstore up with a yelp of joy. Something to look
forward to!

Thanks much!

Greetings All:

While I have no **immediate** plans to run a Tekumel game (mostly because
I have so little "free" time), I am interested in seeing if anybody on
this list is near my locale. My interests are wargames (board and
miniature, mostly anything that involves tanks), GDW's Space: 1889,
Chaosium's Call of Cthulhu, Chaosium/Avalon Hill's RuneQuest and of
course--EPT in it's many forms.

I live in Franklin Park, N.J. (which is roughly halfway between New
Brunswick and Princeton, or as the Saturday Night Live skit might put
it--halfway between Exit 9 and Exit 8A on the Turnpike!).

Please contact me if you are in New Jersey, share any gaming interests,
and might be willing to get together at some indeterminate time in the
future (nothing like commitment, eh?)!

Thanks much.

Yes, I was really thrilled when I saw that too.

(BTW to regular readers, this is Bob Alberti:  I'm changing jobs and 
temporarily at this address, with wings.micro.umn.edu gone down for good.  
Everything will move to new addresses within a few weeks).

TOME announced a publication date for Mitlanyal without talking to me about 
its progress, so that explains the failure to meet that particular 
deadline.  I'm shooting for a Christmas release.

The third novel is not "almost done", but thankfully Phil has started 
working on it again -- when I said it would be out in less than one and a 
half years, I didn't mean it would be out next week.  Hopefully he won't 
get sidetracked and will finish it this time.

I held a copy of Adventures in Tekumel, Part Two, Volume Three, in my 
grubbly little hands last Thursday, so it sure as heck is out now.  Either 
that or my Guiness was particularly strong that night.

- you and your gaming group seriously consider learning Tsolyani so
you can use it while gaming.

- as a result of the former, your co-workers look at you funny when
you use expressions in English like:

"Show it to me, the program."
"I found it, the bug, it was causing the core-dump."

Of course, in Tsolyani, "core-dump" is a "too ignoble" noun.

(Sorry, I have been looking at it at lot lately, "The Tsolyani Lanugage".)

Aahh... yeah...  Brian got it published.  He published it just recently and 
we all like it, don't we folks?  But I lost the address.  Where can I buy 
another copy of this great "Tekumel" game that Brian published?  Mine is 
getting worn out from use...

obviously wasn't what I thought it was... apologies.
