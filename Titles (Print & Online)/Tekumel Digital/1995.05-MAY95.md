Can an atheist suffer hubris?  An interesting question.  "Ha!  I don't

I can accept "unconventional".  Understand:  the gods are insane FROM
THE HUMAN POINT OF VIEW.  Mortals CANNOT understand them.  The gods are
not insane TO EACH OTHER (assuming a pantheon), but from our limited 
point of view, their actions make no sense.  Or, to put it another way,
only Faith renders the gods sane.

I said "MEANINGFULLY".  Sure I interact with my blood cells.  But we don't
discuss Sartre.  Nor can I explain to them WHY some of them must die in
a clot in order to preserve Me, or why several millions of them must be
extracted and frozen and injected into another "god" at some point in the
future.

To blood cells, these things make no sense.  Nor can the cells and I engage
in any sort of dialogue.

: > If a god cannot interact with the universe, than Occam's

: how does the inability to interact affect one's "necessity"?

: Occam is a bit of a thin reed anyway; there are far too many things in the
: real world (let alone the imagination) that are far more complex than they
: "need" to be.

It has to do with belief.  Belief in the Gods rests on Faith alone:  would
you agree that a primary characteristic of God is that s/he cannot be 
proven either to exist or not to exist?  If God can be proven, what is
the point of Faith?

Given that God is un-proveable, you either believe God exists or
you believe God doesn't exist.  According to Occam's Razor, given
two equally likely but un-proven possibilities, it is logical to 
select the less-complex choice as more likely.  Since the Universe
is much less complex without a God (for instance, it removes the
question of "where did God come from"), then Atheism is a logical 
answer.

Is God infallible, omnipotent, and omnipresent?  Omnipotent suggests
that God is not bound by Time, s/he can be anywhere in Time s/he wishes.
This supports Omnipresence.  If God is infallible, then God should never
need to intervene in the Universe, since it is proceeding as God planned.
If God is Omnipotent and Omnipresent, God does not need to correct 
"flaws" (assuming Humanity's Free Will generates them) 'after' they happen,
God can not only see the whole span of the Universe's experience at once,
but all flaws are correctable at their moment of germination and thus
never even occur.

But since God is infallible there are no flaws, and the Universe is running
just as God intended when it was created.... meaning that s/he cannot 
interfere with it without messing something up, or that the Universe is not
perfect, in which case God is not God, but just a Great Big Creature.

If God is perfect, omnipresent, and omnipotent, then God is both inscrutable
and moot.  It's much less work to believe there simply is no God.

: No offense intended; I just relish a good discussion.  :-)

I like my discussions with sauerkraut and onions!

There has been a tremendous amount of material already put into print,
most of it out of print, and generally not indexed, correlated, or
cross-referenced.  Although not a very Tsolyani idea, an Encyclopedia
Tekumeli could be built out of the materials which have already been
published.  If this were done electronically, with the work divided
among happy volunteers, this project could be completed in two years.

Are they typed?  If so, they can be scanned in.

But that's what purports to be in the box: RULES.  It does not say
THE WORLD OF TEKUMEL: A SOURCEBOOK FOR THE CLASSIC ROLEPLAYING MILIEU
BY PROFESSOR BARKER.  You could sell that to a LOT of people, who could
incorporate the source materials into their favorite rule set.  But
instead, we really are being sold a rule set, on that is not easy to
use, and that does not reflect the last ten years of development in
RPGs.  Thus, as a RULES set, it is not attractive to modern gamers.

There is already enough source material on Tekumel to choke a Sredlu.
The problem is putting it all into an accessable and marketable format.
This has not been done.

If the rules are not the point, then why try to sell them?
If the point is Tekumel, then why not emphasize and sell that.

Because I do promotional work for game stores in my spare time (hah!),
I will make a stab at running Gardisayal straight, even though the
Character Rules in Adventures in Tekumel are not clearly written.
But if I run a campaign, I will adapt it to Pendragon, which is easy
and has mechanics for suggesting character behaviors in other cultures.

If in fact most of the people who buy Gardisayal use their own rules,
then the rules (except for magic) are largely a waste of paper which
could have better been used for developing more background materials.

I will continue to promote Gardisayal locally, but it won't be easy.

Berkeley Games carries it, and I imagine Wargames West does as well.
Stores often shift responsibility to the distributor when they wish
to avoid it themselves.

GARDISAYAL is being carried on the store shelf of THE INKSPOT in downtown
San Jose.  Dinah, the proprietor, will be offering regular game nights
(as soon as she can nail down the space), and I will be running intro-
ductory Gardisayal games there, hopefully leading to a regular campaign.

If you are in the San Jose-San Francisco Bay Area, please show your support
by buying or encouraging others to buy TOME's Tekumel offerings at the
INKSPOT.  She will be carrying a complete line as soon as she can.

		Dinah, Proprietor
		INKSPOT
		325 South First Street (near San Carlos)
		San Jose, California
		408/297-SPOT (7768)

If you want to help GARDISAYAL sell well, and see more TOME publications,
volunteer to run one or more Introductory GARDISAYAL games for your local
game store (from whom you hopefully purchased it).  This will help move
the product, encourage the store owner or manager to keep it in stock,
and encourage salespeople to direct customers to GARDISAYAL.

You want it to sell? Be a salesman!

Exactly.  Us peons lower down the food chain will run games in public,
if the people nearer the top will provide us more material.  This can
be done effectively through the medium of the internet, and the materials
CAN be copyrighted as works in progress so that later they be developed
into saleable products.

Let's make this a GROUP enterprise.

I have a scanner as well, and would volunteer to take up part of the
work.  Gosh...I wonder how many volunteers could be recruited?

Definitely an Index.  In fact, perhaps the first thing to do is simply
compile a catalog of all the materials in print, and agree on standard
abbreviations for referencing material.

What we need now are standard abbreviations...

You won't get permission to republish source materials.  Too difficult,
really.  However, scanning, compiling and indexing, yes.  Let's get
and INDEX together, and distribute that as the basis of further work.

Then the work can be compiled and combined into NEW works, based on the
old works, which is more easily done from a legal standpoint.

I strongly encourage players to buy TOME products from their local
game store, rather than direct from TOME.  This encourages shop
owners to keep TOME's Tekumel line on their store shelves, which
contributes to the growth of the market.  By buying from TOME
directly, you bypass both the store and the distributor, discouraging
them from carrying the product in the future.

The Professor is alive.  I got a response to my email to him last
Saturday.

I assume he has better things to do than read the newsgroup?  Others in
his circle of friends do read the newsgroup and are capable of
answering our questions.  Bob Alberti is the one who seems most

A short note on all of this may be in order. All of the Tekumel source 
material, as well as campaign information, was originally indexed and 
databased in late 1986 and 1987; all of the published and unpublished 
material for Tekumel, as well as the database files on all of the known 
player-characters and non-players was in this database/index. This 
information was compiled by a number of the players' in Prof. Barker's 
campaigns. In addition, several years of audio tape recordings were made 
of one of Prof. Barker's campaigns, as well as two campaigns that were 
being run in Minneapolis at that time. The complete records run from late 
1976 to late 1988.

The total files, with maps, fief information, etc, filled some dozen boxes 
the size of Xerox paper cases. They are currently in the hands of the 
people who are producing the 25mm miniature figures, and they can probably 
be contacted through TOME for access to these records. I suggest that you 
can save yourselves quite a bit of work by using these. 

After all, this sort of project is why we did the work in the first place.

I hate to disappoint, but I fear I must refuse this request.  My tables
are slightly reformatted versions of what's in the rules, and to distribute
them would surely be a copyright violation.  If TOME wanted to include
them in the boxes, I would be happy to provide them, though.  (You should
note that my full set of tables--movement, combat, spell-casting, skill
rolls, etc.--come to 12 pages, which would not reduce the anxiety of
nervous referees.  Combat tables alone are only 4 pages, but that's just
about what Swords and Glory's "handy reference table" list was.)
Sorry to disappoint.  Catch me at a convention, and I'd be glad to show
them to you so you could do the work yourself, though.

It seems to me what we could also use out there is adventures.  If we
could get some new adventures published (not that I'm putting down the

might make things easier for beginning referees.  All us referees out

This Memorial Day weekend, I'll be running a Gardasiyal adventure at
TwinCon, a Minneapolis game convention.  It is intended for beginners and will
use the character archtypes for most characters.  I'd also like to 
run a campaign at a local game store, but I have other plots to finish
first, like writing an adventure for publication in Pyramid or somesuch.

If people would do more writing for the 'mainstream' game press about Tekumel,
more people would be brought into the Tekumel fold.  Likewise with
GMing at local game stores.  

For those who would like more info about TwinCon:

Across from the Mall of America.
Cost: $20 (prereg), $30 at door. Daily and 2-day rates

YES!  We need new material.

But wait! For 99% of us, the Thursday Night games are unknown!  Anyone
writing up an adventure based upon that or other existing games would
be recognized as a Hero!

Any takers?



BTW, it's not too late to add your name to the ever-growing list of
Tekumel fans.  I am compiling a list of names and email addresses.  But
you must email me or send a post to alt.games.frp.tekumel to get on the
list.  

When it is big enough, everyone on the list will get a copy and we'll
send it out to game publishers and so on.  

Sort of a target marketing ploy, in reverse...  :-)

Actually, the way I read the situation is that he had worked quite hard,
even though he is in poor health, to get something out to people screaming
for Tekumel stuff, and much of the traffic on the list was overly critical
of that work.  Constructive criticism is fine, but some were downright
rude.  He didn't have to make this effort with TOME, I don't think
he is going to make scads of cash from this, no matter how well it sells.
In fact TOME told me on the phone, that if the new rules don't sell, that's
the end of Tekumel stuff.

He has numerous other projects he is working on, many with appreciable 
scholarly merit.  He takes time out to provide the public with Tekumel
stuff in the best way he can, with the limited time he has, (this is a 
totally personal comment, flame me to cinders if you wish) and we treat
him quite poorly on the list.  I felt like we did, and I am sure he did,
too, judging by the tone of his last message to the list.  He was having 
to justify the new rules, and I don't think he expected having to do that.

Personally, I like the new set of rules.  Sure it may have some problems,
but I find every game I have ever looked at has problems.  Work around  
them.  The magic system itself was worth it to me, and I have S&G volumes
I and II.  I liked the artwork just fine (not enough of it, but then again
I never get enough of Tekumel art!). The paper had a nice feel, the design
was very nice, IMNSHO.  I don't feel ripped off.

In reference to Professor Barker's absence, I feel that he would enjoy the 
list, but I don't think the welcome he received made him want to stay.  So,
he is spending his time on things he feels are more valuable than answering
flames.

Totally agreed. It was really nice to have someone who, in my mind, is

No. He said what he did in response to a previous post. Prof. Barker has
departed the mailing list and ceased to read it inevidently in response to
the criticism of the recent book by Tome that has some many people
upset by its failure to be reasonably complete in regards to mechanics
or including at least some of the world background (Since the majority
of tekumel fans are more inetrested in the world then any mechanics) for
an outrageously high price compared to the rest of the industry.

1.  Being a Texan, I am certain that everyone is entitled to and enjoys
my opinions.

2.  The new rules are better than any previous Tekumel production in
terms of artwork, format, typesetting, et cetera.

3.  TSR and GDW have *recently* produced products of lower quality for
an equivalent price.  TOME at least tried for top quality.

4.  The price is equivalent to a PHB, DMG, and MM from TSR.  The AD&D
set does not include background materials, either.  (Although they are
hardbound, they do not include an attractive box and high-impact dice,
like Gardasiyal does!)

5.  First Amendment rights aside, anyone else who says mean stuff about
the game can either produce something better FIRST!!! Or just shut up. 
Or come down to Dallas and let me provide some insight into how they
might become a minion of Sarku.  >:-)

6.  If Professor Barker was listening to us, it is because we share his
love for Tekumel.  If anyone electronically "spits in his face," they
should be treated with the contempt they deserve.  The loss of the
Professor from the newsgroup is a loss we cannot replace.  It should
not be taken lightly.  

7.  Anyone who cares to flame me can send their remarks to me directly.
 All flames returned to the newsgroup just waste more bandwidth than I
do.  :-)


Just another engineer from Texas who likes Tekumel better than
Forgotten Realms, Grayhawk, Dragonlance, Dark Sun, Ravenloft, or any
other __cheap__imitation__ of the Real Gaming World of Tekumel!

So There!  :-b...

I don't think the people treated Professor Barker 'abysmally'. I think for
the most part people thanked the professor for the gifts of his time, and
that any new system was available at all. I think people were also honest
about their disappointments. One of the best and worst qualities of the net
is that people speak their mind without mincing words. To someone new the
net as Professor Barker is, even posts not meant to be accusatory could
well sound that way. I am terribly embarrased that Professor Barker was
driven off a newsgroup that was in most ways created in honor of his work
and the hunger of his fans. However, at the same time, most posts I saw
were not 'flames', and the critiques were often supported by specific
example, and often well thought out. It is exactly this form of critique
to which the net is best suited, since given a writer and reader both
familiar with netiquette, they can provide information cleanly, without
having to use the polite lies with which most communication medium depend.
Sadly I feel the Professor hadn't had time to learn how to develop the
thicker skin needed when reading some netmessages.

For my personal view on Gardasiyal. I am first off thankful. While it doesn't
contain much information regarding the world, it is a system which can be
played, and which I can introduce to my friends who have never played in the
EPT world. I found the internal illustrations to be wonderful (perhaps a bit
too much of the buxom, bare bosomed maiden, but still sheer pleasure in terms
of costuming, quality and quantity). The box's cover didn't actually seem to
stack up to the inside illustrations sadly. I would have preferred to see one
of the inside illustrations for the cover of the box, which when I first 
opened the package looked rather amateurish. I disagree with those who were 
unhappy about the quality of the booklets. I think they are of good quality.
The type is strong, and thin covers don't bother me, especially since the
box is both sturdy, and large enough to put further campaign information in.

The archetypes are nice. I would have liked a character generation system
with the rules, or given the lack of one... a) A couple ways to vary the
archetypes, and/or b) An explanation of the choice to include archetypes
instead of the standard char gen system found in most RPG. Simply by giving
a paragraph to explain the choice (even saying it was economic) would probably
have appeased most of those who had any complaint on this at all. I think
the basic archetypes are sufficient to start a campaign, especially since
so little does EPT depend on stats and combat/rolled conflict resolution.

I think the books are quite worth the money. I know friends that are 
interested in them as well. I plan to buy the Adventures in Tekumel book
for character generation (which I hadn't done, solo adventures not having
been to my taste.) Now it seems like a nice way to help give people a better
feeling for their character, bringing it up from youth, instead of simply
starting it at X point in its adult life.

I would again like to thank Professor Barker, Neil Cauley, as well as TOME
and those otherwise involved in the production of Gardasiyal. That I have
criticisms doesn't overshadow this basic point. I am glad that I spent the
money for Gardasiyal. Overall I think it is a good purchase, and worth the
cost. It has flaws, but then all systems do. That one of the biggest
flaws is fixable by me for under $10 and at almost no time investment for me,
means that personally it is almost no flaw at all. This may be a problem for
someone who has no idea what Tekumel is, and thus doesn't know why they
should bother going out and buying Adventures, however even if the char
system was included, I'd think players would want to buy the other books,
since they contain far more source material than Gardasiyal itself, and thus
are more valuable to a campaign than is a simple character generation system.

Anyway, thank you all again. I'm sorry that the Professor has left the
newsgroup, I am far more sorry to hear that he is in poor health (which 
after all is much more important), but I'm happy that he is still being
productive, and hope he manages to have many further fruitful years.

Subject: Tekumel campaign in San Jose, CA
Newsgroups: alt.games.frp.tekumel
Distribution: world
Lines: 42

I will be starting a Tekumel campaign based around the Rising Sun Clan,
initially in the environs of Jakalla.  The campaign is being sponsored
by InkSpot Books and Games of downtown San Jose, and will probably meet
one or two Sundays per month.  I will be using Gardisayal rules.

As an experiment, I would also welcome participation via e-mail; such
remote participants would not be limited to the Rising Sun Clan or their
clan allies, but would include rivals or enemies, local officials, etc.

Player characters will be 20-something members of the Rising Sun Clan
who have at least two older siblings, and who have banded together to
form a clique or secret society to further their interests.  Characters
may be generated by any reasonable method, and may pass through the
solitaire games before joining the role playing game.  I may edit or
otherwise alter characters in the interests of meeting play balance.

If you are interested in participating in the face to face sessions,
please contact me, or Dinah, proprietor of the InkSpot, 325 South First
Street (near San Carlos), San Jose, California, 408/297-SPOT (7768).
If you are in the South Bay Area, show your support for TOME and Tekumel
by purchasing your TOME products at the InkSpot, which maintains a complete
line of such products.

Ultimately, we would be aiming at an annual LIVE Tekumel Roleplaying Game,
as several of the people looslely associated with the campaign are costumers.

If you would like to participate remotely via e-mail, please send me e-mail
at 'anton@infoserv.com' with a subject beginning EPT:.  I welcome as many
players as would participate.

If you are running a Tekumel campaign, and would like to link up with mine
as a source of additional depth and detail, I would be happy to exchange
characters, events and other campaign information with you on a regular
basis.

I saw very little in the way of flames. What I saw was a very complete
review of the product, studied step by step, which was then commented on
by people who have either been in the gaming hobby for years or who have
some background in the gaming industry.

Analysis by one's peers of a product that was extremely high priced and
which did not live up to its advertising and expectations (and in some
cases such as myself feedback on how it could have been done at a lower
production cost or included more material that would have satisfied the
major complaints) is not flamming.

Which products are you referring to? I saw no products in the $44 range
in my recent trip to the gaming store (yesterday).

Boxes are a means of disguising lack of content inside a product. I
avoid buying any product in the way of a RPG that I cannot examine ahead
of time unless I've seen sufficient magazine reviews to persuade me
otherwise. The reviews I've seen on this have not persuaded me, and NONE
of the stores in the Boston Area are carrying it either.

The book cost may equal the three books you mentioned BUT does not
provide the same page count or content. You still cannot generate a
character from the new book. It does not have detailed creature info (as
a MM would) and it contains little in the way of cultural info. Page
count (Not including indexes) for the three books you mentioned : MM 380
pages (retail price $24.95 for the copy I have) PH 248 pages (Retail
price $20), DMG 188 pages (Retail $18).

Sorry I refuse to put first amendment rights aside. As for producing
something better if you mean something in regards to Tekumel there's this
little problem called COPYRIGHT that prevents us from doing such.

Texas is on my list of states never to visit, right next to the likes of
Georgia and Alabama. The heat has nasty affects on the brains of the
people who stay there...

Barker only posted about once a week and had only been doing so for the
past month. The Tekumel newsgroup was here LOOOONG before he was on
the net. If his sudden absence kills it then the newsgroup deserves to
end.

No thanks, I prefer that the people who saw your original nonsense

If you believe that the only thing out there is AD&D variants and
Tekumel then you need to go somewhere that they have gaming stores and
see a wider variety of product. There are HUNDREDS of other games out
there, many done better than TSR.

Gack!  I'm not sure I'd want it reviewed in Dragon!  After all the
criticisms it got from the Tekumel fans, I doubt the non-Tekumel reviewer
for Dragon would be kind!  After all, we're pretty much agreed that
the strength of the system is that it allows you to play Tekumel, and as
FRPs go, it's not exactly one of the best systems out there.  A reviewer
simply presented with the boxed set might well give it a thumbs down,
which would really make trouble.  If it were to be reviewed, I'd insist
that the whole package be looked at: Gardasiyal boxed, the character
generation book, the three solo gamebooks, and maybe the Book of Ebon
Bindings thrown in again for flavor!  Even with the full collection
of material in print, I'm still not sure enough of what makes Tekumel
great would be included.

I'm always loath to post if I have nothing to say
about the board subject, which this post is not.
However, I feel this needs to be said.

While I have seen negative reviews of Gard., I
don't have a problem with that.  I seem to
hear people saying "how dare they criticize
w/o having suggestions".  Normally I agree, but
in a game review it ain't what they could do
its what they DID do (or didn't).  I enjoy
Tekumel for source and ideas.  I am buying it
(Gard.) soon.  This is just as much BECAUSE
of the criticisms as the praise.  If all I
got was good marks then it'd've been too
good to be true.  I think I know what's
good about it and bad.  I want to thank every-
one who posted a bad review and encourage
such behavior, as warranted, in the future.
This is especially true of Mr. Teller's
which gave me more information than any
other review i've seen.

I don't know Pr. Barker.  Idon't know why
he's "in absentia".  If its because of
some harsh words then i say tough.  As
a game designer (though not seller) I
relish these negative comments because
it is NEVER perfect and positive comments,
while ego boosting, do nothing helpful
for future versions of the game.

I think Barker is very sharp and do
appreciate his skill in human nature
and culture creation.  I can go
downtown and BUY his thoughts for
about $44.  Mr Teller's and those like
him can only be read via internet.
Without a full spectrum of contributors
I would drop this group like a ....

-Oly  

PS  I do wish he'd come back, I'm
just saying I could live without.

PPS  Just to give this post some actual
MERIT (gasp) ... what do you folks
think about posting source material
and story lines.  This avoids the
copyright restrictions and I'm sure
all us GM types have ALREADY got
stuff written that we'd love to 
share.  I'll start digging if you
will  :-)

Can we please get the tone back to a civil pitch here on the newsgroup?
Also please, if you are going to post, include some content. Its not,
neccessary, but it does mean you are contributing, which helps build up
a strong forum.

For everyone who reacted hostily to the person postin' bout his state
of Texas, please reread it. It seemed to be a bit tongue in cheek.

Basically, if you are going to post something vitriolic, reread it once
before sending it out. Its important to be honest, its not important to
be impolite. Not only that. The respect and value of your words tends to
be higher if you can say it in a lucid and polite manner.

For my bit of content...

Has anyone considered a more heroic world of Tekumel campaign? I've recently
been considering a mirror world where a number of the keys and 'wards' to the
blue room have been discovered. (And probably as more are discovered, the
rate of discovery would accelerate with the new knowledge, and the increased
influence of the scarab Lord.) The secret savants of the temples and perhaps
of certain cults have rediscovered some secrets of the old technology, perhaps
through the manipulation of nexus points to alternate worlds. This knowledge
however would be far from the eyes of the characters. As the various temples
of Change gather their strength secretly (or as much so as this intrigue rich
world ever has real secrets :) the social fabric itself has stretched itself
thin in stagnant manner. While the heirarchies are as set and stolid as they
have been in any recent age, there is a feeling of a weight pressing down on
society. Perhaps its time to raze the cities of Tsolyanu? Whatever it is,
Change is in the air.

How would people go about setting up such a campaign? The friend who first
introduced me to Tekumel recently moved to this area and is working on
putting together a campaign, and I'm considering mentioning this to him.
However, most of the potential players are not familiar with the Tekumel 
world, and perhaps it would be best for new players to be introduced
to the classic world, and not adapt it too much. Still what do people
think? Would the tensions of such a world be tempting?

As some of you may know, I game in Prof. Barker's thursday night group.

I am not here to defend his actions, he is a big kid.  I will however
mention that much of the criticism that was dealt had nothing to do with
him.  The decision to put it in a box was not his.  The decision to not
include the previously printed character generation systemswas not his. 
The decision not to put a sticker on the box was not his.  The decision
not to advertise was not his.  The decision on continuing publication of
Tekumel material will not be his.  All Phil and the rest of us working on
Tekumel material do is write it up and send it to T.O.M.E.  After that we
sit back and wait.  Phil has submitted some great stuff.  THe book on
SUNUZ (the written language of the pariah deities) comes to mind.  The
bottom line is that T.O.M.E. has final say on what does and does not get
done and how it gets done.  They are the money men.

Well, I think he was treated pretty abysmally, and I think his actions show
that he feels he was treated that way.  Some of the messages were incredibly
rude, some were not.  I don't think that the contructive criticisms were a
problem to him.  What he had trouble with was the prevalent feeling that he
had to defend the work.

We should all be embarassed, actually.  I am, also.

Well, many of the gripes were over small details and to me, seemed to be 
blown way out of proportion.  We don't know what kind of email he received,
but I am betting it was less friendly than the posts.  That also may have 
tainted his opinion of the list.

Well, not really.  He was here to help all of us that want to play Tekumel
do so.  He is not obliged to be here.  It isn't necessary for him to partici-
pate for the newsgroup to be a source of Tekumel information.  It existed 
before he came on, but IMHO the traffic that was induced by his appearance 
has been a benefit to all.  He has answered questions in detail, and just 
generally provided some interesting tidbits of Tekumel knowledge.  His 
presence greatly increases the value of this newsgroup to all of us, and the 
majority of his posts ended up answering to people critical of the new rules.  
His departure decreases the value of the list tremendously.  Do you really 
think that he had a reason to stay?  

I think he felt obligated to answer all the posts critical of the new rules, 
because that is just the way he is.  Tekumel is his creation, and he got tired
of having to defend it.

Anoter review deleted...

Again, I don't think he has a problem with constructive criticism.  All rule
systems have their flaws and deficiencies.  Look at the way he runs his Thurs-
day night campaign.  He described it in one of his posts.  

Everyone clamored for a new Tekumel rule system, so that is what was 
provided.  When some people didn't like it, they changed their mind and 
said, "No, just give us background materials and we'll suit it to DnD, 
GURPS, Runequest, etc."  This isn't Burger King: things aren't always 
done "my" way.

Lastly, this response is not an attack on you, Jonathan.  Please do not take
it that way.  Your criticisms were constructive, and the tone of your post was
quite good.  I am just speaking in general terms here to some of the statements
that you made early in the post.

I hardly think that "the new boxed set purports to be a full RPG
system but doesn't contain character generation rules" is a small
detail.

Where have you been!  The Character Generation rules have been out for about
2 years.  

There were some modifications to those rules included in the new set, but the
Character generation rules have been available for quite some time.

I am sorry if you don't like the fact that they weren't included in the box
What would you have like cut out of the new rules to re-print the already 
available character generation rules?

Hello Shane:

I thought I remembered Dr. Barker talking about a gaming group in
Australia that was hot and heavy into EPT.  Were you part of that group? 
Other than that the old set works just about as well as anything. 
Although personally I enjoy the "Quick Play" combat system under the new
rules.  There is a listing in the messages somewhere around here that
gives everything that has been published in the last twenty years.  The
source books are still the ultimate source.  I would recommend (for fun)
the solitaire adventure books, as the stories give the flavour of Tekumel.
 

I am willing to answer any questions you may have.  Good luck!! Keep in
touch!!

Interesting:

I have gamed around Jakalla for a good part of the past fifteen years.  I
can be of some help as to questions you may have.  I am Tekunu hi'Qolyelmu
and you can read about me in the Third Solitaire adventure book.  It is
interesting that you mention Jakalla in that I have been talking to
several persons to develope a source book on Jakalla in that we have pages
of notes on the area  (if I can ever find them again).  Keep in touch.

Here the latest news (at least as far as I know, from the Salarvyani side
of the world during the latest revolt)

As you may remember I stated that the Salarvyani were raiding in groups up
to a cohort along the Tsolyani border.  I believe the palace of Prince
Rarishkala (sp?) was assaulted by about a cohort of Salarvyani.  The
troops there were mostly gone, so the guests ended up fighting against the
Salarvyani and won.  We also know the the Salarvyani have raided almost to
Sokatis.  They have numerouse groups operating in the Hundrani Rise area. 
Small numbers have made it across the Rananga River to the Sakbe road
between Sokaris and Ferina Ra.  Tsolyani settlers have seen groups up to
50 or 100 Salarvyani come through there area.  Sometimes they burn
settlers out, sometimes they pass on after taking what they want.  
Refugees have come across the river.  Due to the civil war, there has been
little response except from ill trained local militia.

There also have been more of the dreaded Ssu in these areas.  As far as I
know they have been sighted more frequently, especially coming out of
caverns in the hills along there usual routes.  Temples and sanctuaries
and villages have been destroyed and looted by both the Ssu and the
Salaryani.

 The Salarvyani pirates are also more numerous along the Point Hrichaku
and the Isle of Songyal.  They have also been sighted along the coast of
the Ganga and Burru Isle. Travel has been difficult, if not impossible. 
It is necessary to go wide of the the se areas and the first landfall
where you won't be attacked (except for "official" boardings) is Dlantla
Isle.   A Tsolyani ship has taken off for a journey around the world with
the traveler/adventurer/botanist Tekunu hi'Qolyelmu aboard.  Although that
adventure is over.  I will provide details of recents happenings in the
Salarvyani cities as our journey took us to most of them.  To inform you: 
the worship of Black Karka (sp?) is on the rise, most cities require an
extreme amount of bribes to get through, a lot of these places have not
seen a Tsolyani ship in several years, we have sighted new monsters, and
of course our renouned Captain Pi'ur (sp?) continues to search for the
Great White Akho !!!

Will keep you posted.

                             3: GENERAL QUESTIONS
                                       
3.1: What is Tekumel?

   Okay, a (not really) brief description of Tekumel: Tekumel was
   discovered by explorers from HumanSpace about 60,000 years in the
   future. There was a terrible nuclear war on Earth around 2013, and the
   European nations and the U.S. and China were destroyed. South America,
   the Indian subcontinent, and the Middle East (for some reason)
   survived (no mention is made in the brief intro of Africa) survived,
   and gradually rebuilt and became a world state of sorts, and humanity
   spread to the stars, using miraculously high technology (FTL
   ships--the "Three-Light Drive," contragravity, beam weapons,
   superdense alloys, androids, and power systems which poked holes in
   the continuum and drew near-limitless energy through from
   n-dimensional space). Tekumel was a large world, but had a light core
   and a low density. It was home to acidic native life forms, several of
   which were sentient and had even attained early spaceflight. Humans,
   and their alien allies, conquered the natives and terraformed the
   planet, making its ecosystem very Earthlike and installing massive
   gravity engines which gave it an Earthlike day and year and 1.0G.
   Tekumel was situated on a major trade route, and became a mercantile
   pleasure world, which had to import metals and industrial goods for
   the very rich who lived there.
   
   Then Something Bad (tm) happened.
   
   Apparently, through unknown agency, Tekumel and its entire star system
   fell into a pocket dimension. Gravitic stresses nearly tore the planet
   apart, and destroyed many cities and installations. Interstellar trade
   was immediate- ly and permanently severed. The native races, who'd
   been confined in prison- like "reservations," broke free and made war.
   Civilization fell rather messily, and the Time of Darkness descended.
   
   Sometime after the disaster, human scientists/philosophers (perhaps
   aided by the some of the more psychically-gifted nonhumans) discovered
   that in the new dimension, the power of the human mind alone, unaided
   by technology, could draw power through from extra-dimensional space,
   and "magic" developed. The sorcerors of the ancient Empire of Llyan of
   Tsamra mapped nexi between various dimensions and made pacts with
   various dwellers of other planes, called "demons" by the uninitiated.
   Great empires rose and fell over the next 30,000 years; the presence
   of "magic" (really psychic phenomena), along with the obvious
   superiority (and near-complete inscrutability) of the sciences of the
   Ancients (whose technology was largely irreparable due to a lack of
   necessary raw materials) led to a stagnation of the sciences, and to
   societies which depended largely upon tradition, precedent, and the
   bonds of family and clan for stability.
   
   Contact was also made with a race of extremely powerful beings who
   were for all human purposes gods. These beings subtly encouraged human
   worship and dependence; great unchanging religious bureaucracies
   developed, and after several millenia of religious warfare, the
   temples agreed upon a Concordat which disallowed open religious
   conflict, which further exaggerated the Tekumelani tendency toward
   stagnation. The people of Tekumel lack the anthropocentric belief that
   the universe is knowable and conquerable; they know that there are
   races and beings which dwarf them in power, and that there are
   sorceries and sciences which are far beyond their grasp; intellectual
   and scientific curiousity is rare and even subtly discouraged.
   
   As a result of these historical processes, there exist upon the face
   of the great primary continent of the northeastern hemisphere of
   Tekumel the Five Empires, all of which are monarchical/theocratic
   oligarchies in which precedent and tradition hold the strength of law,
   and many smaller states which balance themselves between two or more
   of their larger neighbors. There are small enclaves of nonhuman races,
   most of whom owe allegiance to a human empire, and several states
   ruled by the inimical races, who still hate humanity and its allies
   with a passion, but are outnumbered by the more fecund invaders. The
   Five Empires (one of which is the titular Empire of the Petal Throne,
   Tsolyanu) have technology about on the level of the European
   Renaissance (aqueducts, good roads, simple mechanics, wheeled carts,
   siege engines, crude surgery and slightly more advanced pharmacology,
   crossbows, water clocks, etc.). Their governments are greatly
   hidebound and bureaucratic, like those of ancient China. They have
   mighty, well-organized legions like those of the Romans. Their gods
   are like those of the Hindus, with a heavy dose of the bloodthirsty
   Aztec or Mayan deities. Their legal codes and sciences are much like
   those of the Arab philosophers of the Middle Ages; they are obsessed
   with personal and family honor much like the medieval Japanese. The
   societies presented with the game are very intricate and very old (the
   youngest governments are some 2,500 years developed, and they have
   histories, traditions, and myths stretching back some 25,000 years).
   Professor M.A.R. Barker, the author of the game, is a full professor
   of linguistics and anthropology; he has developed scripts, languages
   (and I mean a language one can speak, with a grammar handbook and
   lexicon, like Tolkien's Elvish or Roddenberry's Klingon, in the case
   of Tsolyani), histories, modes of dress, etiquettes, architectural
   styles, weapons and armor, religions, legal codes, demographics,
   sciences, etc. for all of the major and most of the minor cultures.
   
   Since the societies are so intricate and formal, political maneuvering
   and subtlety, combined with the right amount of heroic action and
   appropriate posturing, are the keys to power, and my campaign, as well
   as that of Professor Barker himself from reports, thus deal mostly
   with intrigue and plotting between the various power groups, combined
   with expeditions after some bit of lost knowledge or some sorcerous
   object from an ancient tomb (yes, dungeoncrawling!!!). There are bits
   and pieces of ancient technology which still function (many are
   self-repairing within limits, others have been maintained carefully by
   human and nonhuman sages, or by robot servitors); these are fought
   over as powerful tools. The game's scope is very grand; the Tekumelani
   do everything *BIG*. There are mighty legions of thousands of soldiers
   wearing brightly-laquered armor, wearing great Kheshchal-plumes, and
   beating huge KarengKoreng war drums, sorcerors calling on terrible
   demons with secret names, giant pyramidal temples thousands of years
   old upon which hundreds of war-captives are sacrificed to the Lord of
   Flame, etc.
   
   Tekumelani culture is very baroque, with titles like Reader of the
   Peerless Scrolls of Martial Glory, huge statues of the 97th Aspect of
   Lady Avanthe, Tanule the Patron of Lovers, and twenty-three forms of
   the pronoun "you," to be used when speaking to individuals of varying
   status and profession!
   
   Overall, the gameworld is quite alien to traditional FRP gamers (which
   I happen to think is a good thing, but that's me). Many people feel
   that it's *too* strange, and can't be run by anyone but Barker. I know
   that my gamers, a very traditional sword-and-sorcery blood-and-thunder
   bunch, at first found the difficulty of Tekumelani pronunciation and
   the lack of comfortable stereotypes like barbarian, wizard, elf, orc,
   and dragon, to be disconcerting, but after two years of gaming on
   Tekumel they like it a lot, and use Tekumelani terms to describe
   *other* games and situations. It takes some getting used to, and a
   good bit of homework on the part of the GM, but if you're looking for
   a gameworld that is unique, interesting, and very well- thought-out
   and developed, give Tekumel a go, it's cool. It's much better than
   _Cats_. You will play it again and again.

3.2: Who is M.A.R. Barker?

   Professor M.A.R. Barker was a professor of linguistics and South Asian
   Studies at the University of Minnesota, now retired. He has published
   several texts on the Urdu language, a common language of India and
   Pakistan.
   
   For the most of the last twenty years he has run two weekly groups in
   Tekumel, though he recently dropped one group.

                          4: GAME PRODUCTS QUESTIONS
                                       
4.1: What Tekumel products are available?

   The Book of Ebon Bindings, M.A.R. Barker, Theatre of the Mind
       Enterprises (TOME), 1991. A book on Tekumelani demonology.
       
       Adventures on Tekumel, Part One: Growing Up On Tekumel, M.A.R.
       Barker, TOME, 1992. Character generation rules for the new game
       system.
       
       Adventures on Tekumel, Part Two, Volumes I-III, M.A.R. Barker,
       TOME, 1992-1994. These three volumes are solitaire adventures.
       They give details of the recent political events surrounding the
       war with Yan Kor and the ascension of the new Emperor.
       
       The Tekumel Bestiary, M.A.R. Barker and Victor Raymond, TOME,
       1993. Descriptions of the fauna (and some deadly flora) of
       Tekumel.
       
       Gardasiyal: Deeds of Heroism, M.A.R. Barker and Neil R. Cauley,
       TOME, 1995. It is a boxed set of three books (Player's Book,
       Sorcerous Compendium, and Referee's Guide), plus a folder of
       pre-generated characters and reference sheets. A full-color map
       and dice are also included.
       
       This is a completion of the Adventures on Tekumel series, and Part
       One: Growing Up on Tekumel is required to generate new characters.
       The pre-generated characters are suitable for a quick start to
       roleplaying. The Tekumel Bestiary is needed to provide
       descriptions of the creatures of Tekumel.
       
   
   
   You probably can still get copies of the following:
   
   Empire of the Petal Throne, M.A.R. Barker, reprinted by Different
       Worlds, 1985.
       
       The Tekumel Sourcebook, Volumes I-II, M.A.R. Barker, Different
       Worlds, 1985-1987. The encyclopaedic reference to Tekumel. Only
       two-thirds of the original sourcebook from Gamescience were ever
       reprinted by Different Worlds, but they are still worth it.
       
       I have heard that copies of Swords and Glory, Volume I: The
       Tekumel Sourcebook are still available from Gamescience and
       Andrew Lorince (see below).
       
4.2: What is happening with the current TOME publications?

   Gardasiyal: Deeds of Heroism was released in April 1995. See the full
   description under section 4.1.
   
   If things go well with Gardasiyal, TOME is planning on publishing the
   third part of the Tekumel Sourcebook and Mitlanyal, a book of the
   religions of Tekumel.

            for campaigns as well as single battles. Highly recommended

             Volume 1 (Tsolyanu), M.A.R. Baker, Imperium Publishing

            These volumes are invaluable if you intend to do serious
            miniatures gaming. There is little material for role-playing
            here, but some of the background material may be worthwhile.

   should send L3.00.
   
5.3: What Tekumel books have been published?

   Man of Gold, M.A.R. Barker, DAW Books, 1984.

   Shadowlands BBS [(703) 904-7911] has an active Tekumel board on it. A
   PBEM campaign was played on it at one point.
   
5.5: Is there a WWW page for Tekumel?

   Yes: http://wings.network.com/gopher/tekumel/tekumel.html. This home
   page is maintained by Bob Alberti, one of Barker's Thursday Night
   Group.
   
5.6: What newsgroups discuss Tekumel?

   The main roleplaying newsgroup, rec.games.frp.misc, discusses Tekumel

   This Tekumel FAQ and the archives of the alt.games.frp.tekumel
   newsgroup are available from ftp.io.com in the /pub/tekumel directory.
   Also, the archives of all issues of the Tekumel Digest, a mailing list
   that ran before the alt.games.frp.tekumel newsgroup started, plus some
   archives of the Tekumel board on Shadowlands are also available here.
   
5.8: Where can I get out of print materials?

   Sometimes Tekumel materials show up in the used game bins of game
   stores. I've picked up many items, including an original TSR set of
   EPT. Also, Andrew Lorince has a lot of stuff available at very
   reaonable rates. Send inquiries to the following address:

6.1: Do I have to use [insert rule system] to play a Tekumel game?

   Well, since their are currently three 'official' rule systems for
   Tekumel, I'd say a most definate 'No'. I've played using Runequest,
   Chivalry and Sorcery, Traveller, GURPS and Barker's "I don't need
   rules" style. I've heard of people using AD&D, Rolemaster, and several
   home-grown rule sets. So, the important thing is to play in the world,
   not what rules you use.

I agree that some of the comments could have been stated more sensitively,
but I didn't realize that negative comments were not allowed. One of
the things about opinions is that you can disagree with them, but that
doesn't make them invalid.  They are still that person's thoughts
on the matter. I thought the Professor defended himself well, and after
his explanation, the severely negative comments faded.  This is exactly
how the world in general and Usenet newsgroups specifically *should*
(though don't always do) work. Criticism followed by counter-argument, 
then move on to other things. If Prof. Barker had been on for just a day 
or two longer, he would have seen the strong show of support for his efforts. 
I'm sorry that he fled in the face of criticism. Perhaps someone should
have warned him about the nature of the Internet, it being filled with
opinionated people who, because of the impersonal nature of the medium,
state in no uncertain terms what they think and feel. Perhaps if he had
been warned, things might have gone better.

So, let's not squash differences of opinion.

Well, if anybody is playing in Prof. Barker's campaign, what
are the odds of getting some updates as to what has been
happening?
 
The last I recall, Dichune had taken the throne, booted out by
Enselne(? I think), and then assaulted the capital with hordes
of dead things.
 
Anything new to report since then?

Can we please get the tone back to a civil pitch here on the newsgroup?
Also please, if you are going to post, include some content. Its not,
neccessary, but it does mean you are contributing, which helps build up
a strong forum.

For everyone who reacted hostily to the person postin' bout his state
of Texas, please reread it. It seemed to be a bit tongue in cheek.

Basically, if you are going to post something vitriolic, reread it once
before sending it out. Its important to be honest, its not important to
be impolite. Not only that. The respect and value of your words tends to
be higher if you can say it in a lucid and polite manner.

For my bit of content...

Has anyone considered a more heroic world of Tekumel campaign? I've recently
been considering a mirror world where a number of the keys and 'wards' to the
blue room have been discovered. (And probably as more are discovered, the
rate of discovery would accelerate with the new knowledge, and the increased
influence of the scarab Lord.) The secret savants of the temples and perhaps
of certain cults have rediscovered some secrets of the old technology, perhaps
through the manipulation of nexus points to alternate worlds. This knowledge
however would be far from the eyes of the characters. As the various temples
of Change gather their strength secretly (or as much so as this intrigue rich
world ever has real secrets :) the social fabric itself has stretched itself
thin in stagnant manner. While the heirarchies are as set and stolid as they
have been in any recent age, there is a feeling of a weight pressing down on
society. Perhaps its time to raze the cities of Tsolyanu? Whatever it is,
Change is in the air.

How would people go about setting up such a campaign? The friend who first
introduced me to Tekumel recently moved to this area and is working on
putting together a campaign, and I'm considering mentioning this to him.
However, most of the potential players are not familiar with the Tekumel 
world, and perhaps it would be best for new players to be introduced
to the classic world, and not adapt it too much. Still what do people
think? Would the tensions of such a world be tempting?

Yes. I know that. I bought them when they came out, which was
rather longer than two years ago.

Now take three deep breaths and read what I wrote again. "The
boxed set purports to be a full RPG system, but doesn't contain
character generation rules". Got that now? Boxed set does not
contain character generation rules.

Now put yourself in the position of someone who's always heard
great things about Tekumel, but has never been able to find the
books before. They spot the boxed set. They gasp at its price, but
they shell out the money all the same because they've heard it's
an incredible game. And they get home and open it, and the first
thing they discover is that they have to go out and buy another
book if they want to play it.

At this point they are likely to throw their hands up in despair
and go and buy Warhammer FRP instead. Which makes me very happy,
but doesn't bode well for the future of Tekumel as a game world.

If my company had been doing the game, we'd have included the
first volume of "Adventures In Tekumel" in the boxed set. I simply
cannot begin to fathom the reasoning behind TOME's decision not to
do this in the first place. It's like selling someone a car and
then casually mentioning--once the papers have been signed--that
they'll need to buy the starter motor separately.

I like the sound of that kind of campaign setting - it is 
always interesting when there are powerful factions at work 
behind the scenes, and although this is plentifully provided 
for in the various factions who will be "going for the gold", 
so to speak, it seems equally valid to have an "alternate 
world" campaign where the race is on to find/hinder the 
servants of the doomed prince of the blue room... Especially 
as a campaign involving more powerful characters. 

If I find that I am in a position to start up an EPT campaign 
again, I might pick up on that premise - Thanks!

Briefly, no.

Our campaign left Tekumel Prime's plane (against our will, as usual)
a few months ago.  We spent a lot of time on a Tekumel with no magic
(try opening a Nexus point, just try).  We managed to escape after
several months character time, but have not yet returned to 
our own plane to find out what is happening.

When we left, the following had occurred:

Dhichune was on the throne.

Ksarul Prince Taksuru moved north from Bey Su to parley with Dhichune
and has not been seen again.

Dhichune left the golden tower, secretly, to conduct religious rites 
in the City of Sarku.

Mridobu invaded the golden tower by tubeway car and finding it unoccupied
assumed the throne.

Dhichune returned, undead legions kicked Mridobu's ass outta there.

Dhichune resumed the throne.

The time when we left was mid-Hasanpor, 2367.

The only other news is that the Mu'ugalavyani have invaded and taken over
most of Livyanu, which was devastated by the Plague of the White Hand.
A brief visit there revealed a strong colonial government in place, and
an active Livyani resistance led by a veiled woman.

We have had several campaigns with Dr. Barker regarding a more heroic
tone. 

 One was the "Hero of the Age" story line that involved stopping a pariah
deity plot to drag Tekumel out of the ganglia of planes.  This was done
with the help of Eloa Talshte and his remarkable multi-dimensional,
multi-planer house in the Tlashte Heights.  We traveled to many-many
different planes on that adventure and I have a description of many of
them.
  Another involved the old planetary defense base and defending the
network of interconnected planes from being destroyed, and fighting a
group we called the "Silver Suits".  Although we were some of the most
powerful persons short of the College of Wizards, in a year of adventuring
I only remember killing two of them.  One by collapsing a five or six
story building on it and the other by accident.  Other than that we ran
and ran and ran from plane to plane to plane.  We won temporarily but
about a third(?) of the known planes were ripped out of the fabric of
space and time.
   We also adventured as persons from a city named Onchash Chairon (I am
currently working on a module).  Onchash Chairon, located in the Southern
Continent, is the nexus of many planes. It is the "plug" that prevents the
Ssu from retaking Tekumel from the planes that they still control.  It is
also from here that the Pe Choi can perhaps gain access to the Garden (the
lush green planet that they seek as paridise).  Access is also possible to
the Unstraightened City ( and other like areas), The Space Station and
several other places of interest.  There is a totally new culture and new
magical system based upon sydils.

     The College of Wizards is always a good place to go to get a
"mission". If they allow entrance and don't serve you for lunch to some
creature they have.

As some of you may know, I game in Prof. Barker's thursday night group.

I am not here to defend his actions, he is a big kid.  I will however
mention that much of the criticism that was dealt had nothing to do with
him.  The decision to put it in a box was not his.  The decision to not
include the previously printed character generation systemswas not his. 
The decision not to put a sticker on the box was not his.  The decision
not to advertise was not his.  The decision on continuing publication of
Tekumel material will not be his.  All Phil and the rest of us working on
Tekumel material do is write it up and send it to T.O.M.E.  After that we
sit back and wait.  Phil has submitted some great stuff.  THe book on
SUNUZ (the written language of the pariah deities) comes to mind.  The
bottom line is that T.O.M.E. has final say on what does and does not get
done and how it gets done.  They are the money men.

I haven't seen setnaffa's post here, but I popped over to another machine,
and checked it out.  I have seen no responses to it either, so I must be in
a real backwoods of distribution. :(  But you're right, it was quite tongue

Wow.  What a great adventure.  This one could unfold over a long period of
game/real time.  I could see this campaign going on and on and on and on.  I
would love to play it.  It is one of the active themes I am working on in 
setting up my own Tekumel campaign locally.

Well, the "classic" world is a good training ground...  Take some time to
get the players involved at the lowest level of what is happening, and slowly
bring them up to the advanced layer in which you are interested.  The search
for the keys to the Blue Room is hopefully, a years long adventure, full of 
successes and setbacks.

Strong language and fairly insensitive I would agree. As a newbie on the 
Internet Groups that seems to be the way 'discussion' is carried out :-}

I feel that I have at least been given an idea of what I would get (and not 
get) If I were to shell out goodness knows how much cash for the game once 
(if??) it finds it's way to the UK. All I can say is that it doesn't sound 
like my kind of game system (experience points for killing things - a fun 
throwback to the 70s! :-( ) - but it's certainly my kind of gaming 
background.

Give us a peek of your copy Tom, after you've bought it - or better still 
run the game and post to this group your findings of the rule system in 
action. Count me in...

Regards

Nothing needed to be cut out, as I've pointed out before. Printing costs
are NOT the expensive side of production for an operation like TOME (If
it is there is a definite problem with their setup). The cost difference
to add another hundred pages of text to the boxed set would have been
less than 50 cents a copy.

I have previously reproduced information from one of the printers I have
considered for my own publishing efforts, and shown this.

Its not the Prof. Fault that TOME did a bad job, but TOME should be held
accountable for their actions.

He is not reading the group anymore.  The reasons are basically as stated.

Were he to post his reasons for not reading the newsgroup, he would sound
both somewhat petulant and also as if he was begging to be begged back.
The man has rather too much dignity to stoop so low; he simply left.

It was at my urging that he bought a modem and started reading this group
at about the time TOME released the boxed set.  The very first messages
he saw were highly critical, almost mocking, of this game (e.g. a "throwback
to the 70's" in a recently posted message).  He left. 

Picture if you will that you are invited to a party where you hear several
friends are waiting to greet you.  Picture that you spend good money getting
there, and upon walking in, several strangers can be overheard saying
that your wife is ugly and your kids are stupid.  Picture your disappointment.
Would you stay?   No.  Would you go back?  No.  Picture how mortified the
person who invited you would feel.  Would they feel stupid?  You bet...

You were wilfully misinterpreting what I had written. Condescension

In most RPG rules, a "player's guide" and "referee guide" implies
that one or other of those books/section will contain rules for
character generation. The boxed set is advertised as an RPG, but
ends up being only half of one.

True. But at the same time, the box doesn't inform players that
they will need to buy other supplements to make the game playable.

The game can survive without those. I can think of many
excellent RPGs that contain no bestiary, or which give certain
areas of background in sketchy detail so that they will be filled
out in later supplements. You don't absolutely need that
information to start running the game. On the other hand, not
including character generation rules is, as I observed earlier,
like selling a car without a starter motor.

For the same reason that people buy computers without immediately
buying hundreds of peripherals for them, or that people buy the
first book in a trilogy, not the entire trilogy. People don't want
to commit a lot of money to something until they've tried the
basic product first. The problem is that Gardasiyal is not a
"basic product" because it's incomplete.

Warhammer FRP, not Warhammer Battle. Warhammer FRP is a single-
book RPG which contains an exhaustive character generation system,
a bestiary, information on gods and temples, and a pretty thorough
world background. If you paid more than $25 for your copy, you
were seriously gouged. Gardasiyal, as I understand it, retails for
$44+ in the USA; and if you add the white book and the bestiary
to that, you're looking at another $30 on top.

Would it? Surely if you have a group of players generating
characters at the same time, more than one copy of the book would
be very helpful.

I have never harped at the professor or the group. TOME, on the
other hand, needs a good spanking. If Gardasiyal fails to find a
place in the market, the chances of any other publisher taking
on Tekumel ever again will be very small indeed.

("All right, you big-head," I hear you cry, "how would you have
done a revised edition of Tekumel?" As a generic source-pack, my
friends, including all the groovy stuff like the maps, the
temples, the bestiary and all the other really entertaining
material that would suck people into the world of Tekumel. I'd
also include conversion notes for as many major FRP systems as we
could get permission for. People love Tekumel for the depth of its
background, not for its rules--as succeeding editions have proved,
the mechanics are essentially ephemeral. If TOME drops Gardasiyal,
would Hogshead be prepared to take on Tekumel? Maybe. I'd love to,
but I'm afraid that the way TOME is handling the line is essentially
poisoning the market for any future Tekumel game products; and I
am not prepared to throw away money publishing something just
because I like it.)

Right.

Since we agree to disagree on the state of the rules, let's all get
busy and start those home-made adventures rolling out.  

Let's see now...

.. the party meets in a jointly-rented room above their favorite
tavern to discuss the results of their fruitless job searches that day
when in staggers an old man with a package wrapped in frayed
parchments.  He makes it to the player with the largest HBS and manages
to whisper "the Blue Room..." and collapses, dead of what appears to be
a massive and grotesquely ornate (even for Jakalla!) dagger with sacred
symbols of Hru'u (EPT "Hry'y") on the hilt.

Suddenly you here a commotion downstairs as though a fight was taking
place...   What do you do now?   >:->

I don't know how much I can remember but.......

As to recent news.  I adventured for a period of about four months in
Livyanu.  In Tsamra, the temples are all closed up and protected against
Muuglavyani assault.  There is no real leadership, and it appears to be
every Livyani for themselves.  Most of the larger houses and palaces have
been looted and burned.  Many parts of the town are empty.  Although the
Muuglavyani are in Tsamra, they are not really in control in that they
stay in there parts of the town and only patrol during the days and hole
themselves up at night.  There are several "resistance" groups but they
are fighting a hopeless battle.  Stone cairns have been erected that
prevent the use of magic within the area of the cairns.  These prevent the
Livyani from using their powerful magic.  Prices of course have
skyrocketed in most cities. 

We believe the veiled lady is Narieb (sp?) the wife of Eloa Tlashte from
the Tlashte Heights.  It may also be Narieb's younger sister.  Eloa
Tlashte is a governor of the Tlashte Heights and has a most wonderful
house, that is one of the old planetary defense bases.  I have been in the
house many times and it sports an incredible display of rooms and areas
within it.  The Muuglavyani have not been able to take the house as it is
almost inaccesable and well defended by Thunruu and is actually 
simultaneously on many planes.

We were also involved in some battles in Tsolyanu.  The Muuglavyani have
been moving steadily eastward, although between splitting forces south
(Livyanu) and east (Tsolyanu) they are not that strong.  Unfortunately the
Tsolyani are even weaker.  Near Jakalla and along the eastern border,
Salarvyani have been raiding in strengths up to a cohort.  A lot of the
Stability Worshippers in the area have had there lands taken away and
replaced by Sarku worshippers.   These are lands that have been in clans
for a long time.

I also took part in some of the battles in central Tsolyanu but the
details escape me at this time.

Jonathan, 

I really like the idea of this... it would make an interesting 
setting to have in a tekumel campaign with powerful or 
competent characters, without fear of getting too out of step 
with what is happening in "tekumel prime". 

I love reading about the political shenanigans in MAR Barkers 
Tekumel, and I wish I was up to doing the same sort of thing 
for my players - but as a different issue a sort of hidden 
politico-magic confrontation between different groups about 
the quest to free the doomed prince of the blue room could be 
quite playable!

Thanks for the suggestion!

Neville

I would disagree.  I think it not unreasonable to reply as he did; if
someone tells me that my opinions should not be voiced in a public forum
because they do not accord with his (or anyone's!), I too would feel
obliged to set him straight.  There's flaming, and then there's speaking
one's mind.  I deplore any lack of courtesy (including Mr. Teller's
remarks about the South, which may or may not have been intended
humourously), but I do not feel entitled to tell someone to "just shut up"
because I disagree with them.

Nor do I feel that Mr. Teller's remarks showed "no respect for the genre."
I don't know why we need to respect the genre (I would suggest that,
instead, we respect each other's opnions and the Professor's generosity in
sharing his time with us), but Mr. Teller was speaking no evil about
things Tekumelani.

>From  Flamesong I get the impression that Barker's view of Tekumel may
be a little more science fantasy than many of us might think. There is
more than a touch of Conan Doyle and Edgar Rice Burroughs in that book
and in many of the artefacts and storylines in classic Tekumel.

I like this trend, it's like Glorantha where a touch of heavy pseudo
mysticism is offset by trollball.

But when I spoke to the representative at TOME, he told me that TOME had 
been "led to believe that the boxed set was a complete game." He also 
said that "had they realized that Adventures in Tekumel (the solo book) 
was necessary for character generation, they wouldn't be in the fix they 
are in now; they only had 1,000 copies of the solo book, but 4,000 copies 
of the boxed set." Then he remarked that TOME had received the "left-out 
booklet" with the brief world background and rationale for the box just 
days after they began shipping the box out (implying that it was a 
reaction to the poor response to the boxed set.)

I felt compelled to mention this after seeing postings criticizing TOME

And I feel that a rules set that makes it easy to bring out the unique 
feel of Tekumel, and is up to today's standards, is necessary to market 
the world successfully. I agree with the post describing the system as a 
"throwback to the 70's." Certainly the rules design is not TOME's fault; 
or apparently Prof.Barker's, since he is characterized as interested in 
the world rather than rules.

I wonder if this is the same Tlayesha that a character of
mine met almost 20 years ago in Criag Smith's Tekumel
campaign at the Little Tin Soldier Shoppe. Craig's campaign
was a semi-official offshoot of Barker's campaign at the time,
since Craig was in Phil's game.  I hadn't made any
connections until now. She too was a worshiper of the Emerald
lady.

I remember a very enjoyable evening spent with Tlayesha and
an unremembered number of other participants.  I recall
having friction burns the next morning. *Wistful look*
Those were the days.

As has been previously pointed out, Harn has flourish with a
substandard set of rules (and many years with no rules) on
the strength of their source material alone. Their high
production values don't hurt (and an advertising budget).

Now we have at least a complete set of rules in print.
No matter what your opinion is of them, let's get some
supporting material out.  Publish magazine articles. Run events
at Cons. Runs events at local game stores. Run it with
your friends.  Since it will be a while before new TOME
stuff is published (if ever), then let's use the other
channels available.

Speaking of Cons, is anyone going to run any Tekumel events 
at GenCon or Origins?  May I urge people to think about it?
Other regional or local cons?

I'm a little astounded by the claim that TOME didn't know what they were
selling.  I got the rules before they were released (so I could demo games)
and I called them as soon as I finished reading them--before they were
released.  I pointed out that the lack of a character generation systme
was a serious problem, and I felt they should offer the character generation
book bundled with the game for a discount.  I was told that this would raise
the price too much, and that the archetypes were included for this reason.
Either Shelby spoke to somebody who doesn't know what went on, or else TOME
is trying to shift the blame.  The people I talked to knew what they were
doing.
 
While I'm on the topic, I'm not convinced that selling the character generation
book separately was an incomprehensible decision.  The true flaw was in
having the big delay between it's release and the release of the boxed set.
I thought about this a bit when I first saw the rules--how would I market
it?  Beginners need some background information about the world, a beginning
adventure to see how things should work, and if cost is a problem, a lighter
set of rules that can be supplemented if things work out.  Well--the
character generation system and solo gamebooks offer background information
about Tekumel, a way to create your own characters, and a lighter version
of the rules.  If you like what you see, you can then buy the boxed set.
Mind you, I don't think the innovation worked--I don't want flames about
my thinking this is going to be just fine--and I don't think it's smart to
have no character generation system at all in the box.  I'm just saying
that TOME may have had a plan about this, and they flubbed the implementation
rather badly.
 
When I demo the game, I think I may tell interested people to check out
the solo gamebooks first, and then buy the box if they're up to running.
That's how I was able to show it to one interested "newbie".
 
The boxed set is a done deal.  They're going to have to sell it in order to
get more Tekumel material out there, and they're going to have to sell it
in order to come out with a better version later.  We have the tools, if
we are clever enough to use them, to get people interested.  Suppose we
stop arguing over the merits of the rules (which are, after all, irrelevant--
we are all capable of modifying rules we don't like) and move on?

While checking over the Gardasiyal map, I think I found an error.  The
scale is 7 mm per 10 tsan.  7 mm roughly equals one hex on the Swords and
Glory maps, which were 100 tsan.  Further, the Swords and Glory maps were
equivalent to the old EPT maps, which also had a scale of 1 hex = 100 tsan.
Have I found an error, or has the world deliberately been shrunk?

I think you've found the tail end of an error.  Being neither cartographers
nor mathematicians, a question arose mere minutes prior to the printing
of the map as to whether or not a Tsan was equal to 8.23 miles or .823 miles.
Tekumel was saved from an absurd increase in size by the correct response
that a Tsan equals .823 miles...  however, your perceived error is probably
left over from the erroneous 8.23 assumption.  In fact, glancing at the map,
I'm sure of it.  This error occurred at the printers and in communication
with them, so no opportunity arose to proofread the scale bar on the bottom
of the map.

The boxed set can be seen as a set of expansion rules to build off the 
earlier sole adventures.  You or someone else mentioned that TOME thought
it was a complete all in all set of rules.  It wouldn't have been that 
unless it contained all the solo adventures, the Bestiary, and Sourcebook.
Plus, I wouldn't have assumed that given the numerous publications prior to
the boxed set.

Warhammer FRP in the States was never under $44 when I looked at it.  I payed
$47 (regular price) and got Gardasiyal for TOME's special pre-release price 
and a sale on the Adventure book 1.  I waited for years for a sale on WFRP 
(which I love), but finally had to have it. ( I realize that it is a bit un-
fair to compare sale prices to non-sale prices.)

But since TOME isn't on the net.  The professor was on
the net and he felt he had to respond to these criticisms.  That is why he
packed up and left.  He had better things to do with his time.  You'll be
glad to know that the professor has given some of us permission to release
some of his stuff as Net books.  In fact, I will be opening up a Tekumel
ftp site soon, for the purpose of holding those net books.  We are working
on Deeds of the Ever Glorious first, and then moving on to other topics.

Unfortunately, people were crying for rules.  I've used this

burger king...  You can't have everything your way.  If you don't

Yes, I was trying to be conservative in my time estimation.

I don't see a reason to be condescending.  The box set is exactly what it
purports to be.  It is roleplaying rules for Tekumel.  It says on the box
that it includes a player's guide, sorcerous compendium, referee guide, 
character archetypes, etc.  Nowhere does it purport to be THE ONLY source 
of rules for Tekumel.  In fact, you should be equally chagrined by the fact
that there are no monster/animal descriptions in Gardasiyal.  We are referred
to the Bestiary for that level of info...  What about the information about
Gods and Temples.  That will be in the upcoming Mitlanyal book (Keep those
fingers typing Bob!).  What about the Sourcebook information?

If they are dis-satisified, the can return the product.  I can't understand

Which cost me 10 bucks more than Gardasiyal and 3 bucks more than Gardasiyal
and Adventure Book 1.

That would have been quite a good idea.  Packaging them together would have
been great, but penalizes the people who have already bought the Adventure
Book 1.

It's pretty obvious that we don't agree, and that's ok.  But harping at me,

	That's part of the flaw; the bigger flaw, IMO, is not bothering to 
mention (ideally in Great Big Letters on the front cover of the box) that 
the character generation rules are not included in the box but available 
separately.  (The biggest flaw, of course, was issuing half an RPG as a 
boxed set that retails for roughly double the price of a complete softbound 
book format RPG - which do *you* think newcomers are more likely to drop 
their hard-earned on?)

While I'll confess to mostly being a lurker here and not reading all of
the messages here I don't see things in quite the same light. The rudest
posts I've seen here have come in the wake of Prof. Barker's leaving
this newsgroup, but perhaps I missed earlier posts. The comments I saw
were quite warrented. 

In general the comments I saw were directed at the product. I did not
read a single post that attacked Prof Barker. I did see a few directed
to TOME. I found this posts to be quite informative.

I own S&G volumes 1&2, I have Man of Gold and Flamesong. And I have no
real interest in picking up the TOME products. The rules look pretty bad
to me. And it irks me to have people post about how we all should use
these rules rather than some other system because giving TOME money is
the only way to insure we'll see more Tekumel material. As I understand
it Prof Barker's group uses a free form, almost diceless style of play.
If Barker isn't using the new rules, and maybe I'm totally wrong about
that, why should other Tekumel fans be expected to? I've always wanted
just more background. If Tome had published volumes of background I
probably would have picked them up. 

I think TOME has demonstrated poor judgement and like most companies
that misjudge their market are going to loose money. I don't consider
that an attack on Professor Barker. I wish he didn't feel that he was
being attacked personally. I hope he wasn't in fact attacked personally.
However if the fact that some people who share an interest in Tekumel
had legitamte complaints about the products TOME has put out bothered
him perhaps it is best that he has left.

Let's let the nice readers make up their minds whether that's
wilful misinterpretation or not.

That's how it's advertised in the trade catalogues and described
on the box.

My point. Actually my point is less forceful than that: it would
be a complete RPG if it contained AIT1: the white book, or the
character generation rules from it. It doesn't. My point all
through this discussion has been that TOME is advertising the
boxed set as a complete RPG, and it isn't.

> Plus, I wouldn't have assumed that given the numerous publications prior to
> the boxed set.

Not everybody is aware of those publications. A great many shops
didn't stock them. I believe that the boxed set is attempting to
relaunch the Tekumel background to an audience wider than its
existing fans (if it's not then I have no idea what on earth TOME
is doing), and a new all-in boxed set is an idea way to do this.

The reason I brought Warhammer FRP into this discussion is that my
company, Hogshead, publishes it these days, and therefore it's a
system I know a fair bit about. Its US RRP is $24.95, for a 366pp
book. The $44 you paid would have been an import price for the GW
edition--do you really want to know how much Gardasiyal costs in
the UK?

(An aside: someone mentioned that TOME was printing 4000 copies of
Gardasiyal. They could probably have brought it in for half the
price if they'd issued it in a single perfect-bound book,
including the character generation rules--and you wouldn't have
had those nasty floppy covers on each volume. All right: the maps
and dice would have been difficult to include with that format.
But those maps don't cost $20.)

I thought it was the British who were supposed to tell others
not to make a fuss?

I feel gouged over the boxed set, because TOME has misrepresented
it to the market, which includes me. I'm going to complain about
it in the hope that it's put right in future, and that other people
buy Gardasiyal knowing that it's not the perfect all-in-one
Tekumel package that we've always hoped for.

I'm also complaining now because I'm very fond of the Tekumel
background, and as someone within the RPG industry, I know a bit
about how it all works. Selling an incomplete games system is not
going to get punters to go out and buy the rest of the system: that
only works for collectible card games. What it's going to do is
piss off the market (retailers as well as customers, since
retailers are going to have to listen to their customers'
complaints, and possibly accept their returned goods--I'm sure the
US has the equivalent of a Sale of Goods Act, and if Gardasiyal
claims to be a full RPG and isn't, then it's in breach of it) and
that will make the market hostile, not friendly, to future Tekumel
releases.

I was not trying to misrepresent you.  You asked a question I was surprised to 
see, and I answered it.

You say the box misrepresents itself.  Again, the box is exactly what it says 
it is.  You continue to misrepresent it with misinformation and 
misinterpretation.
 
Other complaints deleted.
 
I am going to leave this argument now, since we both cannot change one 
another's mind.  But these complaints are what drove the professor off the 
list.  You can say that they were directed at TOME all you want, but they 
aren't on the list, and the professor was.  So he felt the responsibility 
to respond.  After numerous responses, he felt it wasn't worth his time.

We have to take the responsibility for this, as we are the ones who caused it.
We ruined a great thing for everyone.  I had hoped to in the end, ask him to 
come back, but after the last week or two, forget it.  I know now that he never
will, and I don't blame him, compliments of all of us who profess to love 
Tekumel.  Don't follow up to this, as I will probably unsubscribe from
the group.  Maybe I'll work up a moderated mailing list and we can get the 
professsor to join in on that.

This is a big misconception about Tekumel.  There are no taverns.  There
are clans that make a living by supplying rooms/supplies for parties, and
wine sellers booths in market places, but no taverns aswe know them. 
Also, there are no Inns in any real sense.  You either stay at your
clan-house or temple or the clan-house of a friend.  Only in the
foriegners quarters might you find a room to actually rent for a night or
two.

Any author, be it academic or commercial or non-profit, must be willing
to listen to and accept critical study of their work. If the professor
didn't learn this after all his years as an academic author than theres
something wrong.

If Tekumel is a 'wrok of love' then produce it and sell it as such,
and take it out of the retail world. The problem is that it is not, it is
a commercial venture and a very expensive one. The Publishers (TOME)
dropped the ball and you are unwilling to admit that they have done so
and instead defend their actions, misleading advertising and poor
excuses.

Running away from critics will NOT help your product one bit. Putting
up barriers (Moderators) on a mailing list will not protect people from
the truth - the more you hide from the truth the more it comes out.
Reviews in the magazines and such will be out soon and they will mirror
those seen here - critical and negative based on the FACTS.

Instead of the problems you are facing you should be finding a way
of helping those people who feel cheated by the events with TOME feel
better about the product. Publish some Tekumel related materials here on
the newsgroup where the public can see them. Help those who need the
startup and background info to acquire them freely or cheaply.

Running proves the points of the critics and proves you have something
to hide.

What, a mailing list where no criticism is allowed, only constant
panegyrics? (How Tekumelani, I suppose.)

I love Tekumel, and will probably get Gardasiyal, but the things I
hear about it don't really inspire me.

Perhaps those Gardasiyal boosters out there might elaborate on what
they find _positive_ about the rules, other than "well, they're rules
for Tekumel, that's enough"? What is it about Gardasiyal _as a rules
set_ that would convince someone totally new to Tekumel to try them,
as opposed to running Tekumel with GURPS or Runequest or whatever?

I, for one, have never been one who wanted rules over background; if I
heard my local game store had a copy of _Mitlanyal_ in stock I would
run, not walk, to buy it.

Gosh... they work, and they work pretty well.  It provides a nice 
backbone for all the newly released TOME stuff, maintains pretty good 
compatibility with the older Swords & Glory, and in general provides what 
I wanted out of S&G #3.  It expands the basic combat and spells from the 
solitaire adventures, allowing characters to grow.  The artwork is great, 
I love the map, and I especially like readibility of text and charts.

I find that if new players like the rules subset in the TOME booklets then
they'll enjoy Gadasiyal as a natural extension.  If those simplifed rules
didn't work for them, then variant rules (GURPS, etc.) might be preferred. 
Certainly, if you're more comfortable with a variant then go with it. 

For *me* it's very simple.... I've been waiting a long time for S&G #3.
It wasn't supposed to be campaign background... that was in books 1 and 2.
What I waited for all this time is in Gadasiyal.  As long as buyers 
understand that it's part of a series of campaign rules and not a 
standalone product, I think they'll be happy.

There's at least one happy owner out here....

I realize that he has probably left, but one point must be corrected.

The outside of the box states 'What you hold in you hands is a complete, 
complex and utterly alien world' or something to that effect.  This is
a grievous error, since what you now hold has essentially no world material,
what you now hold is not a complete game, needing Part One to be complete.

It doesn't matter what is on the inside of the box (a reference to the little
3 page sheet insert). The outside of the box is the only thing people can
see before they buy the product. It doesn't matter what else has been
published previously. What matters is what the box tells the potential 
buyer.

That single statement on the box back is the true killer of this product.,
All other things can be understood and forgiven and even enjoyed.

Don't get me wrong. For me, Gardasiyal works, but I own everything
ever printed about Tekumel.

Unless you find a copy of Swords and Glory, Volume 2: the Player's Book,
Gardasiyal is the only game system that has a true Tekumelani
magic system, including all the spells divided into lists available
to each temple.  It also has many magical devices (Eyes, Amulets,
Magic Books, miscellaneous magic items, etc.) never before published.
I must say that the S&G/Gardasiyal magic system is one of my favorites,
because of the temple divisions and the unique set of spells. I mean,
what other rules give you a spell that can cause you enemies to laugh
themselves to death, or one in which the target is incapacitated
by an extremely intense orgasm.

With Part One of Adventures on Tekumel, the character system has an
interesting skill system, and a reasonable method for generating
the character's past history (sort of like the original Traveller
character system).

But for me, the magic system is my reason for buying this system
(besides my completist nature).

I have given some thought about what barriers there to the adoption of
Tekumel as a world for gaming in.  The rules have already been argued ad
nauseum, and in any case, the rules are not the primary appeal of the game.
There's certainly TON's of background material (much of it, alas, no longer
in print), but when you want to sit down and play, there's something missing.
There's A LOT of background material, richly detailed, but it seems that
much of it is not immediately necessary to run a game.

Then it struck me.  I need a setting I can game in immediately.  Like Jakalla.
Now the city of Jakalla has been touched upon in previous editions, but not
in the detail that is appropriate for a module.  On the other hand, since it
was for a while all we had, I'm sure that everyone who has ever refereed EPT
or Tekumel has worked up some details of Jakalla.

My suggestion is that we, as net denizens, collaborate to produce a module
for Jakalla, and attempt to produce it commercially.  I run a gaming company
(Ishi Press International), so I know what is involved; I also have fairly
good connections in the gaming industry, so I think it can be done.

A city module for Tekumel is exactly what is needed for the market.  It will
provide a ready-made place for campaigns to start and characters to originate.
It will serve as an excellent showcase and introduction to the world of
Tekumel, and it will make gaming in Tekumel possible.  Cities are a great deal
of work, and selling Jakalla as a pre-made city will bring in people from
other games, you will want the city just as a city.

I believe that the depth of detail that we could bring to a Jakalla module
would make it a superior product, one that could compete for shelf space
in game stores on its own, as well as further the popularity of Tekumel.

So come on!  Hasn't EVERYONE run their games in Jakalla at one time or the
other?  Let's see if it can be done.

I like Anton's idea a lot.

Let me ask this of the subscribership: _what can you contribute?_

I'm not asking that you upload 50K of text.  I'm asking for a brief
description of something that you could contribute to an effort like the 
one Anton proposes. 

= = =

An example:

"In our campaign we've fully fleshed-out our home clan, which all the 
PCs belong to.  The Clan of the Granite Shield has medium status and 
medium wealth.  It has a long history of providing stout warriors to the 
Tsolyani legions.  To qualify for ~only~ a Medium Inf legion is a source 
of mild shame.  To even consider joining a Light Infantry legion would be 
discouraged (for the men, that is).  A disproportionately large 
percentage of the Granite Shield women declare themselves Aridani and 
persue military careers as well.

"The warrior clansmen (and Aridani women) are split roughly evenly 
between the Warrior gods of Stability and Change.

"We have developed about 3 typewritten pages of clan history, a two-page 
geneological chart, and about two pages of current clan involvements, 
political influences, internal feuds, etc."

= = =

That was longer than I intended.  How about we abbreviate it like this:

"I can contribute about 6 pages on a Medium status clan, The Clan of the 
Granite Shield.  Their claim to fame is how most of the men, and a 
significant percentage of the women, go on to join various military 
legions of the empire."

Other ideas might be write-ups on temple heirarchies, short (or 
not-so-short) adventures, Underworld areas described, whatever.
 
A lot of you have publicly said here how much you enjoy the world.  Are you 
willing to spend a few days typing up a "chapter" for a compiliation 
product?  You'll get your name in big print in the front of the book, and 
mabye a tiny bit of money.

Some of you know me as more of a Glorantha/RuneQuest guy.  I thought 
_we_ had it bad, with lack of product support and all.  If Glorantha has 
one foot in the grave, then Tekumel is kneeling, soon to be bending 
over to kiss the dirt if Gardasiyal doesn't sell.

Guys like Dave Morris (and the new editor of _The Eye of All-Seeing 
Wonder_, whose name I just don't remember as I sit here at work) are doing 
more than their fair share.  Tekumel needs all the help it can get.

This is not some kind of joke.  Take a few days to think about it.  
What kind of idea could you write 4+ typewritten pages about?  Write 
up a paragraph and post it here.  You'll earn the respect, adoration and 
_support_ of your brothers-in-arms here.

Best,
* David Cheng

But it still doesn't solve the problem of people who never had a copy of
Swords & Glory (like me) and were introduced to the world via the
Different Worlds Books (and desperately want the missing book three
world info) or people who are starting up with Gadasiyal because of the
poor distribution and avaiability of the earlier TOME material.

Newsgroups: alt.games.frp.tekumel
Distribution: world
Lines: 23

After I sent the original message regarding a collaborative effort
for Jakalla, it occured to me that I might have unclear.

I am suggesting that we create something together on the net for
our own use, as referees, and suggest that it might be marketable.
I did not mean to imply that I had permission from Barker to develop
and attempt to market such a product.  I did mean that I thought
that the product of such an effort would be marketable, as it would
fill what I see as a hole.

I apologize for any confusion.  But once you hit the SEND button, it's
kind of hard to take it back.

P.S.  The collaborative Tekumel campaign is going well, with several
      sub-plots developing.  The first face-to-face meeting will be

I wrote Barker to get some guidelines for the small town of Setnakh.
He estimates that the population is 5,000-7,000.  As for religious
preference, he notes that Hnalla, Avanthe, and Belkhanu predominate
in the southeastern corner of the Empire, and therefore presumably
in Setnakh as well. 

Permanent Clan Houses are maintained by (in order of rank):
RANK	CLAN			RELIGION	ACTIVITY
High	White Stone		Av, Dl		Eclectic, Admin, Military
High	Great Stone		mostly Ks, Hr	Shipping, Trade, Beauracrats
High	Amber Cloak		Belkhanu	Priests, Scholars, Physicians
High	Rising Sun		no pref.	Nobles, Upper Class Merchants
Medium	Green Bough		no pref.	Prosperous Agriculturalists
Medium	Blue Stream		Av, stability	Rural Agri., Landowners
Medium	Black Pinnacle		Hr, Ks, Sa	Merchants, Artisans, Laborers
Medium	Black Monolith		Hr, Ks, Sa	Merchants, Artisans, Laborers
Low	Open Hand		no pref.	Peasants, Laborers, Tenants
Low	Green Forest		Av		Peasants, Rural Craftsmen

As well as many other low and very low clans.

It is unclear yet where the Clan of the Ewer of Gold Outpouring fits,
but I'd estimate somewhere in the middle.

One is cautioned against assuming that the higher ranked clans necessarily
dominate, they may only have a token presence, serving mostly as way stations
for there members travelling up and down river.  For example, while they
have no clanhouse, the Might of Ganga maintain transhipping facilities
in Setnakh.  I'd guess that the higher clans are mostly there for that
purpose, and that the real local powers are the Green Bough and the Blue
Stream.

A Hnalla monastery is located just a few Tsan on toward Jakalla, but it
is not very distinguished.  Also there is temple of Thumis that is
distinctly tatty.

There are no ruins nearby, as Setnakh is in the regular flood plain
of the Rananga.  Most of the older buildings of this area go back only
a few hundred years.  Anything older is buried beneath alluvial mud.
There were great cities here during the Engsvanyali period, but with
the sinking of the southern tektonic plates and the drowning of Ganga
itself, most of these remnants were buried.  A few buildings go back
to the early days of the Second Imperium, and there are stories about
artifacts that were saved from the floods and hidden away here and
there.  No idea whether any are in Setnakh or not.

All Barker's players recall about Setnakh was the stench of dirty river
water, mud, dead fish, and soggy laundry.  They crossed over the land

hmmm...one line of text omited, no real loss...

Given what I've discovered recently about Setnakh, we might not want to
emphasize it so much as a starting point for adventures (although one can
see why someone would be desparate to depart for the larger world), but
as a STOPPING point.

As a trade choke point (the Ranaga and two Sakbe Roads meet here), there
could be some shenanningans brewing.  For example, local corrupt officals
might delay the parties transhipping, so that their "more generous" 
competitors can get to market first (and profit thereby).  Setnakh might
have spies from various factions watching the comings and goings of other
factions.  The players could get stuck when Setnakh gets a hundred year
flood (as happened recently here in San Jose).  Rumours of one of the
ancient artifacts Barker mentions might reach the ears of the players.

For the purposes of my campaign, I will need to develop the clan facilities
belonging to the Rising Sun.  But now that we have the top clans identified,
we have something to work on.

We need to start mapping out Setnakh.  I'd guess it lies between the
Rananga River, which runs east-west to the north of Setnakh, and the
Sakbe Roads, which splits to the east of Setnahk.  There would probably
be a larger than usual guard tower at the juncture.  What military forces
there are (Sakbe Road Guards and local Police) would be based there
and the higher clanhouses might cluster there, as well as government and
administration facilities.  Lower classes would live closer to the river,
where flooding occurs more often, and the warehouses would be removed
some distance from the river, probably closer to the Sakbe road.

Probably White Stone holds the Mayorship of Setnakh, although it might
be more interesting if the Clan of the Ewer of Gold Outpouring did.
White Stone and Great Stone provide what beauracracy there is.
Green Bough and Blue Stream are the big landowners; Green Bough closer to
town, Blue Stream in the outlying areas.  Open Hand and Green Forest work
the fields for Green Bough and Blue Stream.  Great Stone, Black Pinnacle
and Black Monolith might have seen some increased business due to Imperial
favoritism towards the Dark Trinity; likewise, White Stone, Amber Cloak,
and Blue Stream may have been the victims of depradations by the new order.

In small towns, clan houses vary from rambling one-story mud-brick, 2-15
rooms, flat roofs of slate or packed clay (more common) plus outbuildings,
to better brick or masonry, 2-3 stories, 10-20 rooms, with townhouses for
work, storage, and sales.  Assuming a dozen of these larger clanhouses,
(the ten medium or higher clans, plus Ewer of Outpouring Gold), and say
50 persons per larger clan house, places 600 persons in the "ruling class."
The rest of the population would live in the smaller mud-brick houses.
Discounting slaves and clanless persons, I would estimate that there some
two hundred clans represented in Setnakh, most of them lowly and unsung.
Most are either laborers involved in support of trade or farming, with
some craftsmen.

There is certainly a marketplace, and probably close to the river.  The
local shrines cannot be spectacular, at best small temples with a few
priests.  Education is provided by the somewhat disreputable Temple of
Thumis, which is oddly enough the largest, followed by Belkhanu (from
handling the dead), then Avanthe (supported by the population at large).
The other temples are even smaller, no doubt, with perhaps the Dark Trinity
sharing facilities dominated by Ksarul.  The temple district (such as it is)
is away from the river, probably on the western side of town.

Chlen beasts are maintained on the northern side of the Rananga, away from
the main village.  A land bridge crosses the Rananga, linking the Sakbe
Roads to secondary highways to the north which deliver mostly grain, and
some limited trade goods to the agricultural villages to the north.
There is a man-made canal, which is used to carry barges from the Rananga
to the clan warehouses closer to the Sakbe.

Setnakh is walled to the west, with an interior wall securing the eastern
quarter (which contains the army, administration and higher clans).  To the
south and east Setnakh is walled by the great Sakbe Road itself, while
to the north, the mighty Rananga river flows.

Well...that's all for now...

I'll sketch out a map based on this, and figure out how best to post it.

I would give a great deal to visit Professor Barker's Jakalla, and I think
that collective version of it would be a Very Good Thing as well.  I'd
love to see it in print. 

However.... why not try our collective hands at a couple of smaller 
projects, as a warm-up exercise?  I'm thinking of a village and then 
maybe a medium-sized town.  If we're going to do justice to Jakalla it 
would help to iron some techniques down.

Besides -- why not create something completely new?

Another thought:

Should these modules be HTML'ed?  (Made into Web pages?)  We could break 
the project down into pieces -- start with an initial narrative... "A walk 
down Main Street"... and then use the descriptions as jumps to whatever 
each of us is working on.  Pick a single site perhaps to store the pages, 
and an administrator to convert incoming files.

One possible sequence:

	Phase 1 - Agree on a setting (location, time, etc.). Discuss what
			sorts of things people are interested in working on.

	Phase 2 - Work out logistics.  Communications method 
			(email/newsgroup/mailing list)?

	Phase 3 - As a group, hash out the main details of the place.
			Write the main narrative, with key locations
			written in boldface.  Each of these will become
			somebody's project.  The most effective way to
			do this is for authors to start with a single
			sentence or paragraph on their assigned location,
			and keep fleshing it out as time permits.  A unified
			naming system would allow us to keep the pages
			organized.

	Ongoing - People keep adding new places and characters.

	Phase 4 - Final draft / cleanup.  Get rid of all the typo's and
			have everybody examine everything in detail looking
			for "factual errors" (esp. information contradicting
			published Tekumel "facts").

	Post the final project as both HTML and ASCII files.

	Think about doing it again.

Once again, we could do a village with small shrines, a few clans, and a 
few local features (a ruin perhaps) as a trial experiment.

------------------------------------------
Lastly:

	I personally would like to see our collective projects stay in 
the public domain, save with obligatory nods to Barker and TOME.  If I do 
this, it's going to be strictly for the pleasure of it.

Well.... let me know what else you think.......

     1) I really like the things that I am reading about writing modules
collaboratively via net. I hope that it works for a number of reasons, not
the least of which is that it might expose the game to new people.

     2) Ready for a bizarre question? I am currently preparing a Tekumel
campaign to run late summer. My group is the kind that likes background
music to be played while we adventure, usually something that will help
set the mood. So what would you play for a Tekumel game? (I told you it
was bizarre....)


     3) I have already made contact with some players who have converted
Tekumel into the Fantasy Hero system, but I would appreciate hearing from
any and all who have done this in the past. (As I said,  I am preparing to
begin in late summer and Fantasy Hero is my system of choice.)

Greets, all --

I recently saw a complete boxed edition of Empire of the Petal Throne 
(all 3 maps, rules, even the extra pages of charts) at my local gaming 
store. $50. I'd be willing to forward it to anyone interested -- I'm not 
enough of a fan yet to buy it myself.

Lemme know -- email's a quicker way to get a hold of me than posting 
here.

btw, does anyone have access to any of the Tekumel novels (are there 
short stories?). This might be a better entry point for me than expensive 
collector's items and Gardasiyal, and I'd love to get a hold of 'em!

An excellent comment.  Starting off with Jakalla is ambitious, and could
certainly continue in parallel with any other project, but Jakalla is 
damn big.  If you were to want to create a 'sample' America, creating 
new York City in toto would be a daunting task.  Start with something
tiny like Minneapolis and go from there.

In this case, starting with a small town would be a good idea.  Not only
is it, well, small, but it will help to illustrate the regional variations
in the Tsolyani culture from place to place.

There are small towns where the primary devotion is to Avanthe, others to 
Sarku, others to Dlamelish.  Each of these towns has dominant clans which 
are only ciphers in places like Jakalla.  The towns have social and
commercial relationships with places nearby.  They may be owned by a
large agricultural clan, may provide the grain or textiles to a nearby
temple monastery, or may have long-standing rivalries with other towns
which are of a friendly or bloody nature as the case may be.  They are more
subject to the whims, graft and corruption of individual persons than are
the large cities.  And everyone knows everyone else, meaning that as a 
stranger you are tracked and known, and as a local your movements are both
closely observed and also subject to immediate assistance if you get into
trouble not of your own making.

Another brilliant idea.  Its not necessary to store the pages on a single
site, however:  HTML links can point from server-to-server as seamlessly 
as when on the same server.  The pages should be centrally archived against
catastrophic loss (i.e. loss of a server), but if each person could own
and maintain their own page they would not be dependent upon any other
person.

This does require some learning of how to publish HTML pages, and beyond
that to the techniques for generating GIFS and fonts with which to dress
it up.  But such skills are good to pick up anyway -- valuable job skills
if you're in the computer field.

: One possible sequence:

Okay.  Suggestion:  central empire, agricultural town, located on a river
with lots of nearby grain fields and a largeish standard roadway leading
to a Sakbe road about 30 Tsan away.  A medium-sized monastery in the
vicinity which requires some logistical support (grain donations, etc).
Time:  present day Tsolyanu (2367), losses of manpower due to civil 
uprisings.  This affects location, so somewhere southeast is best  since
they've been the least affected by the strife.

I personally think this is the only way for a project like this to be
collaborative across more than two or three people at most.  Unfortunately,
the work of driving such a project, keeping everyone participating, keeping
the data tracked as people come and go and their pages drop out and need
to be copied elsewhere, etc, is considerable.  It's a good idea, but don't
enter it with your eyes closed or it will be another of those flash-in-the
pan projects.

Lots of good ideas.  Well thought out.

Okay, yes, Jakalla is probably TOO ambitious.  But my heart is in the right
place.  The reason I suggested Jakalla is that most everyone has seen a
map of Jakalla, and probably most referees have done work in Jakalla.

The previous two comments were quite thoughtful, and I'm going to digest
them before I reply in detail.

But I do think the basic idea is sound: to co-create a setting which we can
use for Tekumel campaigns.  All that TOME and not a single campain setting.

Hogshead Publishing Ltd is a limited company which employs three
people, including myself. I am the director. This does not mean
that I am the company, nor does it mean that the company is me.
When I speak, I do not necessarily do so on behalf of the company,
because my opinions and the policies of the company are sometimes
different.

For example, I feel happy to say that I, James, think TOME are
clots. If I was speaking on behalf of Hogshead, I would never say
anything so undiplomatic, and probably wouldn't mention them at
all.

Public question, public answer. So it goes.

OPENING SHOT:

All right then, let's think about possible locales.  I agree with
"Breadbasket" Tsolyanu ... current time.  Village first, as an exercise,
or jump into a small town?  As an alternative to a village, we could do a
clanhouse or city block.  Whatever we do, I want it to be rich in
descriptive detail.  Exactly the sort of place fledgling refs can start
parties out from.

Just keep brainstorming... thowing ideas out there....

Well, perhaps a bit ambitious for our first project.
HOWEVER, I still recommend we SHARE our Jakalla experiences, so we can
incorporate them into each other's games.  I am committed to using Jakalla,
several others have done so in the past, so even though Project Setnakh
appears to have taken over for the nonce, let us continue to share.

> You might be able to republish the original EPT Jakalla map, too!

The maps need to be fixed, as they are not quite to scale.  Artistic
liberties have been taken which exagerate the size of "important" buildings
and districts, and which diminish the size of more mundane areas.

I have an artist in mind to fix the map, who is well versed in ancient
cities, but this is on hold for right now.  But yes, later, I hope to
have a map of Jakalla which will satisfy modern notions of scale.

Turns out that this piece of information fits EXACTLY into an early plot
for my combined face-to-face e-mail campaign.  I CAN use the information,
and would appreciate anything you could tell me.

I provisionally second Pala Jakalla to be done AFTER we take a real stab
at Setnakh.  I think we'll learn a lot about politics and economics doing
Setnakh, and thendo a much better job on Pala Jakalla.

Is Pala Jakalla at the mouth of the Rananga?

I've volunteered to coordinate the people end of things (communication

Right now, I am e-mail/netnews/ftp only, no Web access, and no time to
learn right now.  A day job, and a night job, and THIS is my recreation.

Alan-

Thank you for your wonderfully detailed reply. It was so interesting that
it
sparked even MORE questions in me. If you have the time, please respond. I
know this is a bit of an imposition.

(By the way, where are you located? Are you in the SF Bay Area (CA)???)

The Questions:

>(Onchash Chairon is in the Southern Continent and I have about a 50 page
Source >Book that I am working on).  If straightened the sigils could
provide unlimited

Who created these sigils? How did they get "unstraightened" -- Nexal
energy
deformation - atomic holocaust? I remember Barker's mentioning that the
Mihalli city was leveled by a planetary bomb during the Latter Times. Any
background radiation still present at the city?

Is there any chance on getting some more information on Onchash Chairon,
such as a draft of your sourcebook. The material you have presented seems
quite interesting. You seem to have spent a good deal of time off of the
common Tekumel maps - i.e. the southern continent and
who-knows-where-else!

Where else have you been?

Who are they protecting it from? The Germinators?

With control of the Unstraightened City the Accelerators hope to

Just where do they "think" that will lead?

of

>plane.  The deities of Pavar do not look kindly upon their actions.

Why do the members of the Engsvanyali Pantheon "not look kindly" upon
that?
Will they not have "access" to Tekumel then? Would this mean a return of
Tekumel to its original location (Nu Ophiuchi) in Humanspace? Why does
Metallja want to guide Tekumel to other planes? Is it to escape the
minions
of the Pariah Dieties? Barker mentioned something about the College of
Wizards fighting the Pariah Dieities at the "End of time". What do you
make
of this?

What more do we know about these Silver Suits? Who fought them? Where have
they been seen? Are they allied with any of the Pariah Dieties? Goddess of

Metaphysical/spritiual concept, a physical location?



Thanks for any further information,

Alexander Stojanovic


Will not be able to answer for some time, as my knowledge is based upon
adventuring.  Therefore, some of the questions you ask simply cannot be
answered as I have none.

I am located in St. Paul, Minnesota as I have gamed with Dr. Barker on a
regular basis.

>>>Who created these sigils?
Answer:Unknown.  It was a long time ago.
>>>How did they get "unstraightened" -- Nexal energy
deformation - atomic holocaust?
Answer:     Unknown, my guess would be both.  When Tekumel was torn away I
believe that along with the destruction caused the power surges that
warped.
>>> I remember Barker's mentioning that the
Mihalli city was leveled by a planetary bomb during the Latter Times. Any
background radiation still present at the city?
Answer:  None that I am aware of.  Although there are many and extensive
"hot spots" nearby.  
>>>>>Is there any chance on getting some more information on Onchash
Chairon,

quite interesting. You seem to have spent a good deal of time off of the
common Tekumel maps - i.e. the southern continent and
who-knows-where-else!

Not at this time:  Without asking Professor Barker first.

>>>>>>Where else have you been?

Answer:   You name it.  I have visited The Garden, (Pe Choi Heaven) where
the Pe Choi were supposed to come from and all attempt to return.  About
50 to 60 planes near and around Tekumel Prime.  Various old planetary
defense bases, some star bases, planetary governor palace, geez about
every city and location on the map.   I have even adventured on the other
side of the planet in Empires very few people have heard of.  I have
adventured (by use of the planes) back in time thousands of years, and
have participated in several of the historical battles mentioned in  the
source book.  I have been to the end of time, when all that is left is the
College of Wizards.  It's tough to sort out and remember although I have
some notes.

>>>>>Who are they protecting it from? The Germinators?

All comers.  There are more players in this game than you can imagine!!!! 
(or me)

With control of the Unstraightened City the Accelerators hope to
>build up power to bring about changes on Tekemul.  This will be affected
by

Will they not have "access" to Tekumel then? Would this mean a return of
Tekumel to its original location (Nu Ophiuchi) in Humanspace? Why does
Metallja want to guide Tekumel to other planes? Is it to escape the
minions
of the Pariah Dieties? Barker mentioned something about the College of
Wizards fighting the Pariah Dieities at the "End of time". What do you
make
of this?

Can't tell you right now.  That would be giving away the "Riddle of
Tekumel".  I would need to clear that with Dr. Barker.

Answer:    These dudes are soooooo nasty that we haven't been able to find
out much at all about them.  All that I know is that THEY ARE TOUGH.  The
keep coming and coming and coming.  They are relentless trackers.  Without
technological help we killed two after having them chase us for a year. 
We collapsed a building on one, and the other fell into a pit and shorted
out.  This was with one of the finest warriors on Tekumel and two of the
most powerful magic users this side of the College.  

>>>>>>>Why the neutrality? Are they afraid of the Germinators? What makes
Metallja
such a standout? What does he know/suspect that the others do not?

Answer:     I can't' remember.  Metallja is sort of an interesting and
complex character.  I need to look into this.

>>>>>Wait --- "Lost Baiyarsha" (in the Jungles west of Livyanu) -- or some
other
place?

Answer:   Yes.  Not all is what it seems.

>>>>>>Where is the City of the Clanless? Does its name imply a rejection
of the
Tsolyani Caste/Clan System? Who rules?

Answer:    Can't Remember:   I think it is located somewhere in the
Northeast Map section near the Planes of Glass.  But don't quote me.

>>>>>>Why are the Silver Suits after you?

Answer:     Can't Remember.  I was being chased down on several occasions.
 I think a lot of this had to do with attempting to prevent them from
conquering planes.  I think at the end of the struggle about a third of
the planes were lost or destroyed.  I remember selling salvage rights to
Gidge and Sons to one aspect of Illoa's House on the Tlashte Heights.

>>>>>>What is this "legend" -- a sort of eschatological sanctuary?
Metaphysical/spritiual concept, a physical location?

Unknown.

I previously asked Prof. Barker a question about such a village.
He wrote:

Later Barker writes...

Asking about the clans there, Prof. Barker wrote:

So it seems to me that maybe we have a good candidate spot for collaboration.
	1) We know it's there, we have confirmation from the Prof.
	2) It is of manageable size.
	3) It is close to both a river and a Sakbe Road.
	4) Since it is on a major trade route (Jakalla to points east)
	   characters might well pass through it, or even start out there,
	   to move up to the big city: Jakalla.

If this is reasonable (or even if it is not), I think that one thing we
need to start working is a clan house.  Everybody has one, every character
literally starts out in their clan house, and the clan is a microcosm of
the society.

Looking at the list of low to middle clans, I would suggest that the
following clans would be found:

	The Clan of the Ewer of Gold Outpouring (given by Barker)
	Ripened Sheaf (High-Medium, Agricultural, no religious affiliation)
	Black Pinnacle (Medium, Agriculture, crafts, artisans, no relig.)
	First Moon (Medium, Merchants, artisans, no religious affiliation)
	Evening Moon (just as above)
	Black Monolith (Medium-Low, merchants, artisans, laborers, Dark Trinity)
	Black Hood, Black Mountain (just as above)
	Broken Reed (Medium-Low, agriculturalists, warriors, misc. no relig.)
	Broken Bough (Medium-Low, Agriculture, Stability)
	Open Hand (Low, Peasants, Laborers, Tenant Farmers, no relig.)
	Sapphire Bird (Low-Low, Peasants, Hmelu/Hma, Avanthe-Dlamelish)
	Blue Water (Low-Low, Wood/Tar, Hnalla, Avanthe)
	Round Rock (Low-Low, Weaving/Dying, no relig.)

Of course, there are other clans, and some of the above may not be present
for one reason or another, but I do note that "no religious preference"
seems rather popular.  Live and let live, eh?  That kind of tolerance
might serve to cover some rather nasty doings, don't you think?

Geographically, I believe Dlamelish, Ksarul, and Belkhanu would be most
popular: Dlamelish due to proximity of Jakalla (and the usual obvious
appeal) and the area's Bednalljan roots; Ksarul also for Bednalljan,
and Belkanu is I believe popular along the eastern rivers.

A lot of clans with no particular religious affiliation would make for
poorer temples in general, I think.

So we might want to start with a clanhouse.  Or maybe we should sketch
out the village first?

I think Setnakh meets these criteria, except that it is closer to the
Sakbe Road (it is where they meet) and further from the river (it is
I guess about 10 Tsan south of the Rananga River.

Monastary could be Ksarul (supported by Black Monolith) or Dlamelish
(supported by various fund-raising events ;-)) or Belkhanu, supported
by the rites of the dead.

I note that in Japan, which has no particular religious affiliation,
people use ceremonies from different religions for different occasions
(Christian Weddings, Shinto Funeral, Buddhist???).  Maybe that's the
way it is with most of the clans; whatever the occasion suits.
Spring rites might be Dlamelish, death rites Belkhanu.

Again, Setnakh is southeast, which is ideal.

I do not have WEB access at this time; many others may not.  I think
some collaboration should be begun here in this newsgroup, with focus
groups exchanging e-mail, and both working documents and more finished
documents accessable by ftp (which is more common than WEB access, and
which WEB can echo anyway).

> : 	Phase 3 - As a group, hash out the main details of the place.

I don't want to divvy it up by WEB pages: it that case I cannot participate.
I think we should discuss this some more, and see how the first few things
divvy up, and then solve the technical problems in response to how things
actually get done.  In the interim, use this newsgroup.

There are newsgroups with a LOT more traffic than this one, so I think
we could stand the increased use of bandwidth, at least in the beginning.
Also, by keeping at least part of the discussion in the group, we can
more easily recruit new participants.

> : 	Ongoing - People keep adding new places and characters.

Yes.  Perhaps some people have some work on small villages already
that they can rub the serial numbers off and re-use.  A clan house
is a clan house.

>

I think with some review and participation by authorities other than
Barker, we could get to a point where it would be manageable to present
it to Barker for critique and clean up.  I'm sure the players from
Barker's game will pipe in if we make big errors (like a TAVERN) and
perhaps the professor can help us keep it authentic.

Perhaps on a larger scale.

Let's try Setnakh, I think it fits.

I'd like to see more than that, but maybe I'm being unrealistic.
Let's see what people bring to the table first.

I volunteer for the PEOPLE end of it, if someone else will handle the

Let's give it a shot.  I've got to do work for my campaign anyway,
might as well share.  If you're working on a campaign, you can share too.

The work that is done could be modified and transfered to other villages.
It's easier to start with a model and work from it than it is to start

Yes, thank you.  I apologize for being over-ambitious with my initial proposal.

I formally propose that we adopt the awful village of Setnakh as our
collaborative setting.  A second?

Again, Aton, an excellent and wise suggestion.  You might be able to
republish the original EPT Jakalla map, too!  I would be happy to contribute
what I have on Jakalla, but sadly, MY sum total consists of a slumlord in
the Foreigner's Quarter and a bit about one of the houses she owns.  I would
be happy to help you in whatever way I can, and I think this would certainly
help Tekumel sell to fans and novices.  How about it, fellow gamers?
Anybody else want to join in?

Actually, in the Eye of All-Seeing Wonder #3, they did some work on the
city of Pala Jakalla for the purpose of setting a smaller campaign city.
Pala Jakalla may still be too big, but there is a map, some personalities,
and some sights to see around town.  It also is blessed by being near
Jakalla, in the Southeast (as Bob Alberti suggested), and has Underworlds.
I'd certainly volunteer to make up some locations and stuff for the town;
I just don't have good Web access (LYNX line-editor only, for the time
being) and I'm unlikely to be able to support my own page for a couple of
years as I march around jobs for a while.  I volunteer to do a clan or
three, maybe some enterprises around town, eh?  Who is going to coordinate
this--I don't think I can, without the web connection.

Gencon is definitely out this year for me, and probably next year as
well, but I keep hoping to go.  (Late August is lousy when you work in
Academia!)  I probably won't make Origins this year, but I am planning
on giving a shot at Dexcon 4 in NJ this July, in the open gaming area.
Dexcon doesn't want to give me a place in the program unless I can prove
the game has some pull, and I'm going to try to get some pull.
If the Dexcon thing works out, I may be able to go to other big cons and
get into their programs.  Maybe we Tekumeli ought to make our own mini-con--
just arrange that a number of us will attend some major con each year
(such as GenCon), and be sure we'll run our games and hang out, even if
it isn't in the program.  If we become a regular event, we'll be harder to
ignore.

I wonder if it is wise to do a super-detail on somewhere that those 
who've been there didn't particularly like, or find interesting.  Surely 
we want to do an area that fairly glows with interest?  Perhaps we could 
pick another town a little way distant, not so well known as a dump?

Good idea to work on an area, tho.  I've nothing on the area, but I'd 
certainly like to contribute.

I'd like to disagree with the following opinions about the direction the 
'group authored' city pack should take, if it actually starts moving in 
any direction, that is:

1) Most activity should happen here on the Internet

2) The final product should be public domain

I fear these two, if implemented, would seriously hamper the success of 
the project.

Activity stays on the net:
Why should only online gamers, or friends of online gamers, have access 
to this material?  I seem to see the same two-dozen-or-so contributors 
here on a.g.f.tekumel.  I bet not more than 500 people around the globe 
even subscribe to this group.  If all 500 take the material and use it, 
I'd consider that a failure.  If I were selling a game supplement 
I'd consider less than 2500 units sold as a failure too, as a reference 
point.

I think the Internet Tekumel community is an excellent place to recruit 
potential contribuors, but not the one place.  

I also think someone has to step forward and be Project Manager.
Any volunteers?


Material is Public Domain:
This is probably my evil MBA education talking, but I think the profit
motive is a good way to keep the project on track and focussed.
While it's not going to buy anyone a new car, it is an incentive to
write, to meet deadlines, and to maintain a sense of professionalism.

If people put some work into producing a quality submission, why not
pay them a bit?

I could go on for hours, but my wrists aren't up to it right now.
Sorry.

against it.  If anyone is interested in ordering it
(this place makes a habit of shipping sales when

Okay, I'll bite.  Here's a list of stuff that I could add; most of it
is not of much help to the Setnakh or Jakalla project, but, others might
be interested.
 
A. The Quest for the Cube of Immediate Immolation.  A large adventure,
published in the Eye of All-Seeing Wonder #4 as "Behind Enemy Lines".
It contains information on the Mu'ugalavyani invasion of the Chakas.
 
B. A short adventure through the swamps around Purdimal, looking for
a Nexus Point to obtain some wealth.  Notable mainly for a minor
link to the action in The Man of Gold.
 
C. The beginnings of a campaign set in Salarvya, 2364.  There is a
bit on a guesthouse in the Foreign Person's Quarter in Jakalla
and the minor slumlord who owns it.  I have described a tiny bit
of sailing into Tsatsayagga harbor, another tiny piece of the
interior of the Ebon Palace, a few monuments in the City of Dead
outside of Tsatsayagga, and the lobby of a clanhouse in Tsatsayagga.
I have also named a few upper-class Salarvyani families there.
Leaving Tsatsayagga, I have one Salarvyani merchant and his eccentric
ship, a description of a famous ruthless Ahoggya pirate, who may
be a myth, and that about wraps it up...for now.  I will keep on
developing the coast of Salarvya as the party progresses.
 
If anybody wants to see this stuff, email me.

Friday, and Saturday nights. Unfortunately, he didn't get the events in
time for publication in the event booklet. I will be attending Gen-Con,
and will, if there is enough interest, run a Tekumel adventure that I am

Wow!

The stuff that's appeared so far ... the Setnakh map, the email and the
postings...
are GREAT!  This is going to be more fun than kittens.

If you haven't seen the map yet, it's in .GIF format and it's at
nexus.prin.edu
(The Blueroom site) along with some great stuff.  I should mention again
that the site is after-hours only, por favor.  (If you have the ability,
go into the artwork directory and look at the big .JPG file.  It's a

Actually both spell functions exist within several game systems,
including MYSTIC EARTH RPG and the upcoming FANTASY REALMS : World of
T'Phon (TM) system.

This is not meant to detract from Tekumel, but I hate the spread of
minsinformation....

In answer to several questions on the subject:

The current subscription rates for the Eye for US subscribers are $6 per 
issue in US funds, or 4 pounds in UK funds.

The only back issues available now are #3 and #4. Both of these are 
available from:

Dave Morris
1 Rusham Rd
London SW12 8TJ
United Kingdom

(Dave edited & produced the first 4 issues)

Nos 1 and 2 are not are no longer available from Dave. It's possible that 
some game stores have copies - I think about 40 issues of each went to 
TOME but I'm not 100% positive. I do know that 60 copies went to Esdevium 
Games in the UK.

I think Pala Jakalla would be a good choice. It fits Bob Alberti's idea 
of working on a smaller project and yet is close enough to the Big J. to 
have a little intrigue and adventure.

I have not finished the temple book "Mitlanyal".  It will be released
as soon as I finish it, which will be as soon as I can possibly manage.

To avoid disappointing people any further, I would suggest that it is 
unlikely that it will be published this year.  Even were I to finish 
it immediately, layout and artwork would likely push it out beyond the
end of the year.

Sorry about that.  If it's any consolation, I'm done having kids,
which has been the major impediment to progress.  That and fixing
up Macintoshes for the use of Professor Barker and his cronies.

The Northeast frontier is already in the works.  The maps are completed,
and the interviews with the professor are done.  I am now in the process
of transcription and formatting the interviews.  I hesitated to mention
this earlier for fear of having people continually harranging me to get it
done, ala Bob Alberti and the temple book.

I hope that I will have something to say about the future of Tekumel.
Tonight I will be meeting with an author to produce a campaign module
for Tekumel that I think has a good chance of being approved by Barker.
My plan would be to raise the capital necessary to entice TOME to publish
the work (my guess is they won't be terribly enthusiastic).  I will bear
the upfront development costs myself, and hope to recover them.  I am also
developing some marketing materials for Tekumel for TOME to use to promote
the game.

There is also progress being made in putting together previously unpublished
maps, using professional mapping software, and perhaps ultimately producing
an Atlas.  At the very least, some of the maps can be incorporated into
the campaign module.

I think Tekumel sorely lacks a campaign module, and that this contribution
might help to reverse the slump.

More news as it develops...

Well I've been a reader of this group for some time. I avidly awaited
the release of Gardasiyal hoping for a new age of Tekumel gaming.
Well this group has desended into bickering over how bad the release
of Gardasiyal has been done. I've talked with several die hard fans
of EPT who loved the poor dot matrix printed books, and they really
feel like they got ripped on Gardasiyal. 
I'm not trying to start a thread about this. What I'm trying to 
get it is. Where do we go from here?

Someone earlier mentioned Columbia games Harn world in comparison.
They mentioned it's die hard group of fans, and the lack of a rule
system for the world for quite some time. Well I would have to say
there success is based on the fact that they reprint everything on
a rotating basis. If one waits long enough you can buy it all.
Tekumel stuff suffers from continually switching of rights, everything
>from  the past is out-of-print, most likely for a long time.

Also Harn is based a huge set of source books, detailing (over-detailing
in my own opinion) each city and province. 

Now, if one were to assume that Harn was a successful model to follow,
for a game with a core following, then to get to this the following would
have to happen.

1) TOME should keep the rights, instead of instituting another struggle
over who's going to publish.
2) A list of what's wrong with Gardasiyal, should be compiled and
 nicely conveyed to TOME. In hopes that they can sell the copies
they've made and work on a re-release. As a fandom, we should
work toward having a relationship with TOME.
3) The idea of people on the net working on details about cities
is an excellent idea. Eventually this infomation could be compiled
and possibly run by M.A.R. Barker for editing. I do think it should
be edited quite a bit before attempting this. (No hundereds of air-cars
sitting in garages, etc). Then the possiblity of province books, or
area books detailing relationships exists.

Maybe there is hope of an Encylopedia Tekumeli

Now please do not flame me, but offer better ideas if you think
this just really wolfs.
