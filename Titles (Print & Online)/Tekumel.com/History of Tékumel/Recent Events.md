## The War With Yan Kor

The nation of Tsolyánu is currently engaged in a war with its northern neighbour, Yán Kór, whose ruler is known as Baron áld. Born in Sa’á Allaqí, Ald travelled south and joined the Tsolyáni army as a mercenary. He rose through the ranks to become General of the Legion of the Scarlet Plume, before he was betrayed by Tsolyáni politics during actions against the city-state of Yán Kór. His legion was wiped out, and has never been rebuilt; áld himself was offered a position in the Yán Koryáni forces.

*Declaration of War* in Tsolyani

áld welded the armies of many small northern states into a fighting unit capable of repelling the many Tsolyáni missions sent to defeat the rebellious northerners. During the last expedition, Tsolyáni forces besieged a city whose defence was being directed by áld’s beloved mistress, Yilrána. Yilrana refused to surrender the city believing the Baron’s forces to be nearby, but her judgement was misplaced. The Tsolyáni forces broke into the city, and (following their usual practice) impaled Yilrána as the leader of the defenders. Upon arrival, áld discovered his slain lover and has vowed implacable revenge on all things Tsolyáni, going so far as to form a secret alliance with Prince Dhich’uné of Tsolyánu to overthrow the emperor.

## The Death of Hirkáne

In 2368, the war in Yán Kór involved many of the Legions of the Empire, and two of the major Princes, Eselné and Mirusíya, followers of the war-gods Karakán and Vimúlha respectively. The death of the old Emperor Hirkáne, ‘the Stone on which the Universe rests’, started a chain of events which plunged the entire Empire into a civil war.

Prince Dhich’uné, a priest of the worm-god Sárku, chose this moment to make a play for the throne. Citing the war as a need to have an Emperor on the throne, he forced an early _Kólumejálim_ (the ceremonial process by which the new Emperor is chosen), timed such that neither Eselné nor Mirusíya could attend. Those Princes and Princesses who could attend chose to renounce their claims to the throne, avoiding the ritual slaying of the failed candidates at the end of the selection process. Dhich’uné ascended the throne, styling himself ‘Eternal Splendour’. Many were uneasy, both at the haste and unseemly proceedings of the _Kólumejálim_, and at the choice of title by a follower of a god whose worshippers can expect to rise as undead.

## The Civil War

Factions led by several Princes took to the field, involving almost all the military forces of the Empire in a many-sided war. The Mu’ugalavyani took the chance to seize the city of Butrús and surrounding territories, and for a time chaos reigned. During the fighting, Dhich’uné attempted to have Baron áld killed so as to remove one potential problem, but áld escaped is currently holding Yán Kór together.

Dhich’uné, against tradition, left the Imperial city of Avanthár to travel to a religious ceremony in the city of Sárku, and a military force led by Prince Mridóbu, a Ksárul worshipper, entered Avanthár and took the throne. His reign lasted two days, and was ended by an invasion of Dhich’uné’s undead army from below the city, amid much bloodshed and horror. Mridóbu’s current whereabouts and health are unknown.

## Dhich’uné’s Fall

Eventually, in 2369, the factions of Princes Rereshqála, Mirusíya and Taksuru united and forced Dhich’uné to flee Avanthár, and indeed the world of Tékumel for another Plane. A _Kólumejálim_ was called in Béy Su, and representatives of the major power blocs—the assorted political parties, the temples, the military and the clans—were all present, as well as the Imperial heirs themselves. The only potential problem was that, since he was still alive, Dhich’uné could challenge for the throne, and a challenge was something no-one wanted. The final act of the drama took place in the High Chancery of the Palace of the Imperium in Béy Sü. The legions, most of whom has supported the late Prince Eselné (he had died the previous year, ingloriously, of a wasting disease) declared their full and total support for the Imperium, allaying fears of a military coup. Mirusíya announced his claim to the throne. Most of the other heirs renounced their claims, but Taksuru announced that he too would challenge for the throne. This shocked the whole crowd; Taksuru had been expected to bow to Mirusíya. At this point, seeing that there would be a challenge, Jayargo, Dhich’uné’s secret representative at the proceedings, tried to have the proceedings declared illegal—Dhich’uné was, he declared, the rightful Emperor. This declaration was thro
