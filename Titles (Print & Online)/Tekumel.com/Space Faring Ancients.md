Well I did dig up some interesting source material from Phil's Pe Choi essay, relevant sections of which follow.  
  
... Long before Man had stretched out his hands to the stars the PÃ© ChÃ³i had developed space flight and the torque-stress interdimensional drive.  
  
... It was on the advice of the PÃ© ChÃ³i that Man steered away from the deadly worlds of the HlutrgÃº, then a localised but ferocious and powerful spacefaring species. They were again instrumental in keeping human ships away from Pelagus (sigma Sagittarii), which was inhabited by a race so dangerous and inimical that no species could approach them with impunity. [who are these inimicable beings???]  
  
I've also found some intersting snippets in the blue room archive. This section on races for instance.  
...Humanspace included other citizens as well: the Pe Choi (whose scientific abilities had made intersteller travel feasible), the Ahoggya, who built great, boxy, bumbling merchant ships that bought stuff that other races treated as vile waste; the Shen, whose own fleets ranged far from their home system; the Pachi Lei, Swamp Folk, and Hlaka, whose cultures were smaller and less technological, but who had the capability to take Pe Choi technology and construct their own merchant fleets' the Tinaliya, who were intensely curious but who were so logical that they never developed an aesthetic or spiritual understanding at all. Etc. Still other races may also have existed within this sphere, including some that were hostile to Humankind.  
  
Lastly something on the organisation of the star empire  
... The pre-Tekumel form of government is hinted at in one myth-cycle as a sort of vast bureaucracy operating under a council of Archons (this is not the name in their language(s), of course). Each planet had its governing structure, but all joined together in this single great council (held at different locales from time to time), whenever need demanded. There were (and probably still are) spheres of power other than Humanspace scattered across the galaxy, with still more existing on other Planes that can be reached by nexus point gateways from our own space.  
  
So a lot of decent stuff to go on I think and all canon material.
