The mock-Tsolyáni names may or may not be appropriate - probably not; I developed these things some time ago. (Although I now have the language book, I don't claim any skill in its use.) Perhaps the names are in some language of the far side of Tékumel where these things live. Please remember the bulk of these were created while I was in high school, so go easy on them (and me) if they don't seem absolutely brilliant.  I've included EPT stats.

Yes, folks I went through the  AD&D Monster Manual and placed this in the campaign. Make of that what you will. It looked sufficiently alien to me.

An import from some place called 'Earth'. I thought that some crocodiles would sit nicely and enjoy basking in the sun of Tékumel. I thought they'd really like it in Livyánu. Why deprive them?

I believe I stole this from a D&D article in Dragon magazine. I'm not sure. Please remember these were not intended for publication and written many years ago so if you find 'borrowing' just tell me and I'll 'fess up.  But here goes. Hoofed animal, badger's head (metal plates for teeth) yellow and gray color, leathery skin, carnivorous and they enjoy human flesh. They're rather cunning and have a voice imitation ability similar to a parrot's. They enjoy yelling "Help. Help." And eating the helper.

Okay. I know fully well I 'borrowed' this one from the great story 'Sand Kings' which has since been filmed as an episode of the Outer Limits and shows up in some video rental stores. Giant, ant-like, telepathic, hive mind. Sometimes used as pets as they will worship their owner. Roll on NPC table for reaction to strangers. They come in three sizes. 40% small, 35% medium, 25% large. A hive of the small ones has a value of 5d6 x 10 Kaitars value to a pet shop owner.
