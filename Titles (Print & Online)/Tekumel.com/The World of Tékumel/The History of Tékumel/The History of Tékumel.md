The history of Tékumel strides across eons. The oldest written records date back only some 25,000 years—and this dating is doubtful at best. Before those records stretch millenia—the Latter Times, the Time of Darkness, far back to the distant age when Tékumel was first discovered by explorers from Humanspace.
