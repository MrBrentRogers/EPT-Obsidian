# ![Ahoggya](<Titles (Print & Online)/Tekumel.com/Images/Ahoggya.jpeg>)Ahoggyá

“Or you might find a normal man to jolly you?” Old White-side gurgled a chuckle. “Some say that your body is appealing in spite of your veil. Now if it’s pleasure you seek, then know that we Ahoggyá have eight sexes and –”from The Man of Gold by M.A.R. Barker, ©1984 DAW Books

The gruff and boisterous Ahoggyá tend to be rude and insensitive, obeying their own alien customs and displaying little interest in man’s concerns. Some Ahoggyá emerge from their swampy habitat to serve as mercenaries in human armies for a few years, but they eventually return home. They have no curiosity about religious matters, and are abysmally poor sorcerors.

## Physical Attributes

The Ahoggyá are four-armed and four-legged, barrel-bodied, bristly and knobbly. Their four arms extend out at equidistant intervals from under a domed, thickly armoured carapace on top of the body. Between and below these arms, protected by a horny ring, are the eyes and other organs: two eyes and a fanged mouth on one side, and two eyes and other organs on each of the remaining three sides. Excretory organs are tucked up under the body. Their thickly muscled legs extend out from the base of the body in a permanent crouch, and their hands and feet both possess three digits and a thumb. They range from 1.41 to 1.60m in height, but their torso is perhaps 80cm in diameter. They have eight sexes, but their reproductive processes are largely unknown.

## Enclaves

Along the southwestern coasts of Salarvya, across the sea in Haida Pakala, and in a large and as yet unexplored region in the far southeast called Onmu Tle Hlektis, an autonomous Ahoggyá state.

# Hláka

![Hlaka](<Titles (Print & Online)/Tekumel.com/Images/Hlaka.jpeg>)

The skittish Hláka are generally neutral to man’s doings, talkative, curious, and a bit scatterbrained. Hláka mercenaries may remain away from their homes for two or three years at a time, but then insist on returning, often never to return. Their flying talents make them valuable as scouts, and they can sometimes be persuaded to drop items on enemy troops if they are not in danger themselves. Hláka are terrified of ships however, and may literally die of fright if forced to travel by water.

## Physical Attributes

Hláka are slender, light-boned flyers with leathery wings and greyish or brownish short fur, ranging in height from 1.4 to 1.59m. The head is humanoid, somewhat flattened, with three close-set eyes (often bright blue) beneath a heavy brow ridge; a furry ruff at the sides and back of the head conceals their hearing organs. They possess a powerful prehensile tail which ends in a rapier-like bony blade. Their arms and legs are relatively weak and they hate walking for prolonged distances. Their are two sexes: males (55 percent of the population) and females (45 percent).

## Enclaves

Mountain eyries in Kilalammu, to the east of Tsolyánu.

# Hlutrgú

  
![Hlutrgu](<Titles (Print & Online)/Tekumel.com/Images/Hlutrgu.jpeg>)

The violently inimical little Hlutrgú are one of mankind’s most implacable foes, fighting  
with vicious fanaticism in battle and torturing any captives in ways too ghastly to  
describe. Although they prefer the isolation of their bogs, they occasionally venture forth  
to raid human villages or harass local shipping from small coracles of skin. Were it not  
fo r the terrible losses which an army would suffer and the difficulty of invading their  
tidal swamps, the Tsolyáni might have exterminated them all long ago.  

Physical Attributes  
Tough, rubbery, and totally hairless, the Hlutrgú have a rotund body, four limbs each  
equipped with a usable hand with six fingers, and a skull-like head, the mouth filled with  
needle-sharp fangs. They are mottled greenish, greyish or blackish in colour, and range  
from 1.23 to 1.71 m in height. They have three sexes: males (95 percent), female spawners (4 percent), and asexual ‘leaders’ (about 1 percent).  

Enclaves

Isolated bogs in the Kaija Protectorate.

# Hlüss

The insectoid Hlüss are indigenous to Tékumel. They are friendly to the Ssú and sometimes to the Shunned Ones, and neutral to the Hláka when the latter are not accompanied by humans. They love to set gems all over their bodies in intricate and beautiful patterns in a cement-like substance which they secrete. A mighty Hlüss warrior makes for a fearsome and magnificent spectacle indeed.

Though preferring to dwell on their lonely island, the Hlüss are inquisitive and greedy for magical devices and weapons, and occasionally sail forth in their hive-like ships (made of the same bodily secretion) to seek items of interest and food for their young. Each nest-ship and each settlement contain at least one of their huge breeder-females—the ‘Hluss-Mother’. The young are brought forth in sac-like eggs and are inserted into a paralyzed living host (who dies an agonising death), where they remain for about 125 days before emerging. The Hlüss can be detected at sea by their constant buzzing, humming sound, and on land their acidic, sweetish odour may be smelled at a distance of 30-40m. There are three sexes: the male fertilizers (5 percent), the female egg-layers (2 percent), and the neuter worker-fighters (93 percent).

## Physical Attributes

The Hlüss possess a long, segmented, scorpion-like body, four high-arched legs, a prehensile tail fitted with a paralysing sting, two smaller forearms ending in three digits and a thumb, and a broad, flattish head with three eyes and a sharp proboscis above a set of razor-sharp mandibles. They are covered with a light, chitinous exoskeleton and are greenish blue to shiny black in colour. They normally remain on all fours, but may rear up and use their central pair of ‘hands’ as tearing weapons in battle, though they do not employ swords or other weapons with these limbs. They range from 1.22 to 1.62m high on four legs, gaining perhaps another metre when they rear up.

## Enclaves

The island of Hlüssuyal.

# Mihálli

“... some creature out of an ancient bestiary, furred all over, a snarling animal muzzle rimmed with up-curving fangs, pointed ears like those of a Renyu, two arms that were over-long, jointed in places where no human—or Pé Chói—had joints. Then the edges of the beast’s image sparkled, faded, and solidified into other features ...”

from The Man of Gold by M.A.R. Barker, ©1984 DAW Books

The Mihálli are gifted with great sorcerous and interdimensional powers, and it is said that they may even exist on more than one plane at once. Their motives seem unintelligible, for at one moment they may be friendly and helpful, at the next they may be hostile, and at the next they may simply disappear. They are so rare as to have become almost mythological on Tékumel—in fact they prefer to remain aloof from human affairs.

## Physical Attributes

The alien Mihálli are essentially man-like, though with five fingers and a thumb on each hand and six breasts, and the head is reminiscent of a great cat with up-pointed ears and large opalescent red eyes. They are slender, and range from dull green—the lower caste warriors—to reddish brown—the leaders. The Mihálli have the ability to change shape; adopting the appearance of another being of comparable size, though if the imitated being has more than four limbs (or a prehensile tail), these would appear to be paralysed. Moreover their eyes remain a gleaming red despite their disguise. It is the thought that the species is hermaphroditic, but their reproductive processes are largely unknown.

## Enclaves

Unknown. This race is not to be confused with the modern human inhabitants of Mihállu, their ancient homeland.

# Nyaggá

The Nyaggá are an aquatic race that remain aloof and generally do not bother human shipping, though they have been known to come ashore for infrequent and brief nocturnal raids. Dead specimens have shown that they are essentially mammalian, and there are rumours that the Nyaggá can interbreed with humans—as witness the vestigal gills and pallid appearance of the folk living around the cities of Ngaku and Prajnu. However they cannot—or do not—communicate with man and react hostilely to incursions into their watery domains.

## Physical Attributes

The body of the Nyaggá is a long, tapering cylinder some 3m in length, without fins or scales, a sickly grey-white in colour, and ending in an eel-like tail. The head is round and bulbous, soft and segmented like a human brain. A central black-lipped mouth is surrounded by a ring of six great jet-black eyes. Six long retractable tentacles covered with tiny suckers and cilia, which serve for hands, emerge from a ring of muscle at the juncture of the body and the head. Totally extended, the Nyaggá is about 5m long. In water they swim with a sinuous quickness, while on land they pull themselves along with their tentacles in combination with a coiling of their bodies. Their reproductive processes are unknown.

## Enclaves

Beneath the waters of Lake Parunal to the east of Yán Kór and Sa’á Allaqí.

# Páchi Léi

“They were pear-shaped, soft-skinned beings, greyish-green in hue, a hand taller than a man, with four curiously articulated lower limbs for locomotion and four more, longer upper limbs for swinging in the trees of the forests of the Pán Chákan Protectorate ... [they] wore little more than cross-belts of untanned hide, and their leader carried a short, thick spear tipped with a barb of white bone. Harsan stared at them, and they stared back from round, platter-sized eyes, greeting him pleasantly enough in oddly accented Tsolyáni and chattering amongst themselves in their own burbling tongue.”

from The Man of Gold by M.A.R. Barker, ©1984 DAW Books

The forest-dwelling, friendly Páchi Léi are active in human affairs, enjoying politics and social interaction enough for many of them to have attained high posts in the army, priesthoods and administartion of the Tsolyáni Imperium. They despise the Mu”ugalavyáni, however, because of historical massacres of their race by the inhabitants of that country.

## Physical Attributes

The Páchi Léi have four short legs, a soft, grey-green pear-shaped body covered with small knobs and pendulous protuberances, four slender upper arms with four fingers and a thumb on each hand, and a heavy-jawed, toothy, animal-like head. Their huge, platter-shaped eyes permit them to see well in the dark, and they also possess an atrophied ‘sixth sense’. They range from 1.53 to 2.01m in height.

The Páchi Léi reproduce by budding; exuding spore-like spermatoza which fertilize the ‘egg-buds’ on the bodies of others. These become pod-like extrusions which burst open to release an infant in about 250 days. They have no families as such, but tend to live in small groupings of two to eight individuals.

## Enclaves

The Pan Chaka Protectorate is the Páchi Léi homeland.

# Pé Chói

![Pe Choi](<Titles (Print & Online)/Tekumel.com/Images/Pe Choi.jpeg>)

“But yet what a Pe Choi! Instead of the sleek, dully-gleaming black nudity of the Pé Chói of Do Chaka, this specimen was decked out in an oddly-fitting copy of a human’s kilt, a gorget of Chlén-hide, and—most ludicrous of all—a hat! ...The Pé Chói minced forward on his two powerful rear legs, articulated tail swaying in unconscious imitation of a dandy’s walk. ‘I am Chtik p’Qwe, Scholar Priest of the Fourth Circle.’ ”

from The Man of Gold by M.A.R. Barker, ©1984 DAW Books

The Pé Chói are most comfortable in a thickly forested habitat, but they enjoy human society, join human institutions, and copy human dress and customs. They possess considerable psychic talent and are often found in the temples as scholars. The Pé Chói may seem a little ‘delicate’ in human terms, and they often conceal their own cultural attitudes behind smooth and sophisticated facades, however they are perhaps the most ‘human’ of the nonhuman species.

## Physical Attributes

The slender and graceful Pé Chói are from 1.63 to 2.2m in height, covered with a chitinous exoskeleton (males are jet black, while females are chalky white), with two powerful rear legs, four smaller upper limbs ending in bony three-digited hands with an opposable thumb, and a segmented prehensile tail. The head is long and slender, with two large green eyes, a tapering proboscis, and two fan-like ‘ears’ at the rear of the skull. They have excellent hearing and vision, and a simple form of telepathy which can detect the presence of another creature within 2m. The same sense can detect when a member of their species has been slain within 5km, and if they can ascertain who was responsible, they are unforgiving and implacable enemies thereafter. They also possess a double set of lungs, one in the upper torso and another in the lower abdomen.

The Pé Chói have two sexes, plus a ‘neuter’ stage which can be adopted by either sex. males make up about 40 percent, females 35 percent, and the neuters 25 percent of their population.

## Enclaves

Various, most notably Do Chaka.

# Pygmy Folk

“To bargain with a Pygmy is to lose one’s purse” Tsolyani proverb.

from Empire of the Petal Throne by M.A.R. Barker, ©1975 TSR

(Tsolyáni:Nininyal ‘the Little Ones’; Yán Koryáni: Nyenu)

The Pygmy Folk are generally friendly to man, but can sometimes be cruel, are often capricious, and are reknowned for their greed and avarice. They are ferocious opponents if attacked and will fight to the death, but will resort to traps and ambushes to avoid battle if faced with a larger group.

## Physical Attributes

Small (.43 to .91m) and rodent-like, the Pygmy Folk possess a sharp-featured face, large ears, greyish or blackish fur, two muscular rear legs, two upper arms with three-fingered claw-like hands (plus a thumb), and a vestigal tail. Their sight and hearing are excellent—they can see easily in pitch darkness. There are three sexes: males (55 percent), females (15 percent) and hermaphrodites (30 percent), who dwell in families but produce no offspring. Their communal life is both complex and intense.

## Enclaves

Subterranean burrow-like towns in the northern plains of Yán Kór.

# Shén

![Shen](<Titles (Print & Online)/Tekumel.com/Images/Shen.jpeg>)“The sixth member of the group was a nonhuman, a hulking reptilian Shén, native to the hot lands south of Livyánu, half a continent away. He traded in the flame opals of Pán Cháka and in garnets, commodities which the Shén knew were valued by humans and other species, but which they themselves held in no particular esteem. Although the Shén was friendly enough, his guttural name was unpronounceable—something between a hiss and a snarl.”

from The Man of Gold by M.A.R. Barker, ©1984 DAW Books

The ferocious-looking Shén are mildly friendly towards men, rather harsh and abrupt in manner, a little clumsy, and laconic of speech. They dislike over-refinement and delicacy and value physical power, ferocity and endurance. Their psychic and magical talents are weak, and they are disdainful of sorcery. Preferring the heat of their southern enclaves, they come north only for brief periods to serve as mercenaries. The Shén never forget an offence—they still hate the Ayoggyá because the latter once cooked and ate some Shén captives during the invasion of Salarvyá by Emperor Hejjeka II ‘the Heretic’ (1,325-1,340 A.S.)—a perfectly natural act for the Ayoggyá.

## Physical Attributes

The Shén are great armoured reptiles that stand between 1.83 and 2.31m high and are roughly humanoid, standing erect upon two powerful rear legs and with two forearms ending in three-fingered hands with an opposable thumb. They are covered with shining black scales (the fashionable among them paint these in iridescent colours), and have a thick, prehensile tail with a mace-like knob at the end which they use in combat, a curved, beak-like snout, double rows of needle-sharp teeth, and a crest of glittering spines. These usually lie flat along their skulls, but are extended when the Shén becomes enraged.

The Shén have three sexes: males ('egg-creators') about 40 percent, females ('egg layers') 35 percent, and ‘egg-fertilisers’ 25 percent. They are divided into genetic lineages called ‘egg-groups’ that may be friendly, neutral or dangerously hostile to one another, and their states are built around these groups.

## Enclaves

The large Shén states of Shényu and Mmatugual, and several little states including Gai, Ra and Qonu.

# Shunned Ones

Tsolyáni: Vleshgayal; Yán Koryáni: Blashagh)

These hideous, gangling beings are totally inimical to mankind and his allies; mighty sorcerors who in small parties search the ruins and labyrinths of ancient Tékumel for magical devices and equipment. Very little is known about their society, for their sealed domed cities keep in their own noxious atmosphere; a corrosive, yellowish gas that renders humans incapacitated after 30 minutes and kills within another 45 minutes at most.

## Physical Attributes

The Shunned Ones are humanoid, very tall (from 1.85 to 2.33m), with extremely long, bony limbs. The face is puckered and wrinkled like rotting fruit and has only a pair of round, black, pupiless eyes for features. The mouth is hidden in a mass of wrinkles at the base of the throat. They wrap themselves in voluminous, flapping robes of dust-brown or night-black. Their worst feature, however, is their terrible and repellent stench, which can be detected at a range of as much as 60m! Specimens possess at least five types of organs which may be reproductive in function—these may represent different sexes, or they may be developmental stages in the life-cycle of one sex.

## Enclaves

Sealed domed cities in the barren plains of Yán Kór.

# Ssú

![Ssu](<Titles (Print & Online)/Tekumel.com/Images/Ssu.jpeg>)

“Four wide-spraddled legs extended out from the twisted column of the torso ... The head was oval, the face only vaguely human; there were two eyes, round and black-gleaming, and nostril slits but no nose. The mouth consisted of a vertical ellipse. It was the thing’s skin that was the most repellent: it resembled mottled gray parchment peeling from a roll, the ends loose and ragged, very much like the winding sheet of a corpse long in the grave.”

from Flamesong by M.A.R. Barker, ©1985 DAW Books

The ancient Ssú were once masters of the land masses of Tékumel, while their cousins the Hlüss ranged the coasts and the seas. They hate mankind for destroying the original form of their world. There are two sub-species: the Grey Ssú, and the larger Black Ssú. Both species are excellent magic-users, and they also possess a limited hypnotic ability which can immobilise human warriors or cause them to turn and fight their friends.

## Physical Attributes

Though differing in height (the Grey Ssú are between 1.71 and 1.90m in height, the Black between 1.83 and 2.41m), both varieties of Ssú are similar in appearance: a central torso set upon a narrow abdomen from which extend four equidistant legs. There are two upper arms ending in three digited hands (the largest ‘finger’ functions as a thumb), but they sometimes rear up on their back legs to fight, using their middle limbs to hold a shield or another weapon. The head has two eyes, nostril slits, and a mouth shaped like a vertical oval. Their outer integument is wrapped around their limbs like paper on a roll, and the loose ends of this ‘skin’ keep pulling off in fragments, making the Ssú look like a tattered mummy. The Ssú smell rather like musty cinnamon, and their language sounds like a sweet, high chiming, rippling up and down the scale like a chorus of little bells. They have three sexes: males (15 percent), females (5 percent), and neuter worker-fighters (80 percent).

## Enclaves

The Grey Ssú dwell just north of Salarvya and Pechano, while the Black Ssú are found on a biggish island far off in the western ocean. There are also enclaves on Tékumel's other continents. They yearn to retake their ancient stronghold of Ssúganar, now in Pecháno.

# Swamp Folk

![Swamp Folk](<Titles (Print & Online)/Tekumel.com/Images/Swamp Folk.jpeg>)

(Tsolyáni: Heglethyál; Mu’ugalavyéni: A’lathish)

The Swamp Folk fit in very well with man’s cultures, and their talents as sailors make them the mainstay of the Mu’ugalavyáni navy and commercial shipping industry. They are usually friendly, courteous, and eager to copy the ways of men, except in their own enclave where they preserve some of their ancient customs. They cannot use other-planar magic at all, but they do have a natural ability to sense ‘wrongness’; for example changes in direction, sloping passageways, and interdimensional nexus points.

## Physical Attributes

The Swamp Folk are about as tall as men and have a rotund, rubbery, doughy white body, four slender legs extending at equidistant intervals from the body, two upper arms with four digits and an opposable thumb, and a head with rather humanoid features. The skull is long and backward-slanting, with a bony crest rising from the forehead and curving out over the back—from this crest a flexible ‘drapery’ of skin falls down behind the shoulders to join the body at the base of the spine. There are two sexes; males (70 percent) and females (30 percent).

## Enclaves

The watery bogs along the lower reaches of the Putuhenu River in Mu’ugalavyá

# Tinalíya

The small Tinalíya are intensely curious, learned, materialistic, often generous, and disturbingly literal-minded—they cannot comprehend exaggerations, jokes, idioms and figures of speech, which sometimes results in misunderstandings. They are good fighters, and noted for their magical talents and skill with devices of the ancients. The Livyáni permit several legions of Tinalíya to serve under their own leaders as a defence against the Mu’ugalavyáni, whom the Tinalíya despise as being too officious and insistent upon their formal bureaucratic procedures.

## Physical Attributes

The Tinalíya range from .56 to .75m in height, have four short, outwardly-bowed lower legs, a spherical abdomen, two long arms ending in claw-like three-fingered hands with an opposable thumb, and sloping heads with huge eyes and vaguely humanoid features. The body is divided into small bulbous segments and is covered with a horny integument, usually tan, russet or deep brown in colour. There are three sexes: males (10 percent), females (5 percent), and neuters (85 percent); the latter sex, and a few females, are usually the ones who wander out into the world to explore, trade and satisfy their curiosity for a few years before returning to the intricate social life of their cities.

## Enclaves

Communal underground cities in the southern foothills of the Tlashte Heights in Livyánu.

# Urunén

The Urunén have only recently come into contact with the inhabitants of the northern continent; therefore not much is known about them. Their society is homogenous, complex, and inward-looking; they are good scholars and exhibit psychic talents on a par with those of mankind. The Urunén have shown an ability to dissemble and play at diplomacy, and is likely that their cleverness will make them difficult allies and dangerous foes.

## Physical Attributes

A little taller than mankind (from 1.45 to 1.93m) and quite humanoid in appearance, the Urunén have a muscular body covered with brownish, velvet-like fur, and possess a long tail. The head is rather alien however; long-snouted, triangular, like a cross between a serpent and some bovine animal. The eyes are set wide apart on each side of the head. There are two sexes: males (35 percent), and females (65 percent).

## Enclaves

The sub-polar regions around Tékumel’s south pole.
