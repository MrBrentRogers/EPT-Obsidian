_Where multiple attacks are listed, the creature can employ all attacks at full-value in every round UNLESS the attacks are given as alternatives. For instance, the Ru'un can use both sword and bolt-gun every round; whereas the Thunru'u can use a weapon OR grapple - not both._

# FLYING CREATURES

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cholokh "Flying Octopoid Creature"

BITE Attack = 10 damage: 1D10-1

or THROWN ROCK Missile = 10 damage: 1D6-1

Armour 2 Magic Resistance +2

Hit Points: **5** [1/2/3] Evade 9

The Cholokh is a six-legged creature armoured in brownish grey chitin, with long iridescent gauzy wings hidden beneath a shell cover. In front, near its powerful mandibles, it has eight small prehensile tentacles. It uses these to hurl sharp fragments of rock at prey up to 20 metres away. Once a target has been wounded, the Cholokh will close to finish it off. These creatures prefer dry conditions and are encountered in deserts or remote mountain passes, making their lair behind boulders. A lair will typically consist of a group of some twenty or thirty Cholokh, and they will attack even if outnumbered - though they will pick off stragglers or advance scouts rather than attacking the whole of a large party.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dlakolel "the Steed of Sarku"

BITE Attack = 17 damage: 1D10+3

Armour 3 Magic Resistance +7

Hit Points: **16** [4/6/9] Evade 5

This armoured titan (3-4 metres long) gets its nickname from the coppery sheen to its chitin armour, which evokes images of the mythical beetle-like servitors of the Master of the Undead. It is slightly intelligent and does not invariably attack humans. However, if it does fight it will do so to the death. It has six legs, gleaming black mandibles that do great damage in melee, and heavy shining wings.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Gerednya "the Flying Worm"

BITE Attack = 12 damage: 1D10

or STING Attack = 16 damage: 1D6

Armour 1 Magic Resistance +5

Hit Points: **11** [3/4/6] Evade 7

These creatures are like long, slender greyish-green worms with membraneous wings. They have a sting in their pliant tails, and any character struck by this must make a +3 Stamina check. Failure causes another 2D6 damage and induces severe muscle spasms that will reduce the victim's Dexterity to 1 for several hours. This can be counteracted with the "Eye of Healing". The Gerednya can also strike with its needle-sharp proboscis (60% chance of using the tail-sting and 40% chance of biting). They flock in colonies of twenty or thirty, usually in regions of dank palmetto forest, and can sometimes be driven off by fire (40% chance per round of a burning brand driving one off if thrust into the creature's face). If slain, a Gerednya's wings are worth up to 100 Kaitars to tanners of Chlen-hide, since they contain a chemical used in the molding of this substance.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Giriku "the Flying Reptile"

BITE Attack = 15 damage: 1D10

Armour 2 Magic Resistance +5

Hit Points: **12** [3/5/7] Evade 6

These bluish-green nocturnal beasts have long snouts set with three rows of needle-pointed teeth. Their six eyes see well even in near-total darkness, but they are blinded by full daylight or the brightest light-producing spells. They congregrate in swamplands and river deltas in family-groups of ten or more. Their peculiar musty odour - somewhat like dried fish - is repellent to man, and the redolence hanging in the air around these creatures' lairs ensures they rarely take a human party by surprise.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Kayi "the Eye"

TENTACLES Attack = 15 damage: see below

Armour 0 Magic Resistance +8

Hit Points: **14** [3/5/8] Evade 3

These creatures consist of a large gas sac and a single huge, bulging eye. They prefer to hang high in the air in dark corners and drop their thin fibrous tentacle-nets down upon passersby. These nets have a 75% chance of trapping a victim (an Evade is only permitted if the character was aware of the Kayi's presence) and will then drain away life-force at the rate of 1D3 points from both Strength and Stamina each round. The victim is held paralysed while his life is drained, dying when either attribute is reduced to 0. If the net is cut away by another character on the first round, there is a chance (based on a -3 Stamina check) that with immediate rest the lost attribute points will return in a few hours; otherwise the loss is permanent. Cutting a companion free requires a character to score a Heavy Wound on the Kayi with an edged weapon such as a sword - and a +5 Weapon skill check is needed to control the blow, otherwise the enmeshed character will also be hit. Kayi can be brought down by arrows (flaming arrows are said to be particularly efficacious) but they usually remain out of reach of hand weapons shorter than a spear.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Kữni "the Falcon"

PECK Attack = 20 damage: 1D3

Armour 1 Magic Resistance +2

Hit Points: **1** [-/-/1] Evade 16

These brown bird-like creatures have a limited intelligence and the ability to speak if trained. They do not properly understand the meaning of what they say, but they can be taught to associate phrases with specific circumstances. Thus they are useful as hunters and scouts, since they can report back to their master on the disposition of troops, terrain, etc. Communication should be on a very simple level, eg: "Lots of men walking south, ten Tsan away." Wild Kni can be lured down with aromatic Tsural buds, or shot down with blunt-headed arrows smeared with sticky gum. Training it then takes about two months until the creature is ready for falconry, plus another three months if it is to be able to speak. (Kuni would never normally attack a human, but combat statistics are given here in case one should be brought under control and ordered to attack.)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lri "the Flying Stinging Creature"

STING Attack = 20 damage: 1D6+2

or BITE Attack = 13 damage: 1D6

Armour 2 Magic Resistance +5

Hit Points: **16** [4/6/9] Evade 7

These stilt-like insectoids are related to the hideous Hlss. They sting with their long segmented tails, paralysing a victim who fails a -3 Stamina check. They will try to fly off with a paralysed victim if his combined Size plus encumbrance does not exceed 20. The Lri then follows a random route to its lair, where it feeds the hapless victim to its young. Companions of the victim must succeed in a -5 Hunter check to find the lair. If they cannot locate it within half an hour, the victim is completely eaten and cannot be restored by Revivification since no recognizable fragment remains. A paralysed victim rescued from the Lri's clutches can be cured by a Heal Serious or an "Eye of Healing". He remains weakened and sluggish (able to perform only one half-action each round, or a full action every other round) for two days.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Shanu'u "the Flying Carnivore"

BITE Attack = 14 damage: 1D10

Armour 1 Magic Resistance +7

Hit Points: **20** [4/7/11] Evade 5

These winged killers are warmblooded and covered with grey fur, and range from six to eight metres in length including the long tufted tail. They live in high mountain eyries comprising some twenty adults plus their young. Usually they only attack if they outnumber a party, and they are intelligent enough to avoid travellers who are conspicuously armed with missile weapons. They are related to the Hlaka, and if a party contains one or more Hlaka then there is a 70% chance that they will be allowed to pass in peace.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Teqeqmu "the Drifting Fungoid Creature"

LASH Attack = 16 damage: 1D6+1/1D6+3/1D6+5

or GAS [see below]

Armour 0 Magic Resistance +6

Hit Points: **20**/**30**/**40** [-/-/-]

This spongy, shapeless khaki-coloured bag of noxious gases floats on the wind in mountainous, forested or swampy regions. When it encounters a victim, it drops down and exudes poisonous gas over an area 3 metres in diametre. Those caught in the gas must succeed at a -3 Stamina check or collapse immediately and die within 1-3 rounds. The Teqeqmu can also lash out with its whip-like central tentacle to a distance of 5 metres. It has a 60% chance of using its gas and a 40% chance of hitting with its tentacle on any given combat round. These beings vary in size: 40% small, 40% medium and 20% large. They are unaffected by degrees of wounding, and if struck down they will regenerate within an hour if not burned thoroughly.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vorodla "the Flying Undead"

CLAWS Attack = 19 damage: 1D10+3

Armour 3 Magic Resistance +13

Hit Points: **11** [-/-/-] Evade 8

These dingy blackish creatures tend to hover near ancient tombs and ruins, either solitarily or in hosts of up to several dozen. They are the restructured and reanimated bodies of ancient warriors, set originally to fight as defenders of the Citadels of Ksarul. They have huge leathery wings and shelter from the sunlight in ruins or cave lairs. At night and on overcast days they emerge to hunt for living flesh - or to do their masters' bidding, for some of these creatures are still in the command of the priests of Ksarul or Sarku. The body of a Vorodla must be burned, since it regenerates within a few minutes. They fight like all undead, taking only half Melee penalties from wounds and never needing to check Stamina. These creatures are carriers of a kind of psychic plague. After a battle with Vorodla, each character who was wounded must make a Psychic Ability check at +4. If the character fails he loses 1 from Psychic Reservoir and must attempt another check (this time at +2) after one hour. Each failure reduces the character's Psychic Reservoir still further and necessitates another hourly check, with the modifier diminishing by 2 each time. The procedure stops when the character either succeeds in one of the checks or has had his Psychic Reservoir reduced to 0 (in which case he dies and can never be restored to life). The points lost are permanent.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vringalu "the Feathered Snake"

BITE Attack = 20 damage: 1D10+1

Armour 2 Magic Resistance +8

Hit Points: **18** [4/7/10]

These ropy, feathered snake-like creatures habituate the tree canopy of dense jungle, from where they glide down to attack their prey noiselessly and viciously. (Some smaller varieties are adapted to desert conditions, drifting low over the dunes in search of prey.) Their plumage is of a startlingly metallic hue - usually blue-black, green or gold with black patterning for camoflage. A Vringalu's bite induces rapid gangrene which kills within an hour if the wound is not treated with Tsural buds (make a +5 Physician check or a +10 Hunter check to be aware of this remedy) or by a spell of Cure Disease. If untreated, a Stamina check at -10 is allowed to shake off the infection, but the victim will still be weakened and feverish for several days: temporarily reduce Strength, Stamina, Dexterity and Intelligence by half. A victim who is treated with Tsural buds remains giddy and nauseous (Strength, etc, reduced by 25 percent) for a day or so.

# NONHUMANS

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ahoggya "the Knobbed Ones"

WEAPON Melee = 15 damage: 1D10+3

Armour Magic Resistance

Hit Points: **20** [4/7/11] Evade 6

The Ahoggya inhabit damp lowlands in southern Salarvya and across the Straits in Haida Pakala. They are squat knobbly creatures 4-5 feet in height, with a bristly acorn-shaped body that can be almost 3 feet broad. The upper torso of an Ahoggya is surmounted by four powerful arms, and their eyes and eating apparatus lie beneath these under a horny protective carapace. They have four legs, also equidistantly spaced and covered with thick cords of muscle. Ahoggya are intelligent and can speak human languages - albeit with an atrocious accent. Despite the complexities of their own culture, they remain aloof from human affairs and generally give the impression of being gruff and insensitive. In battle, an Ahoggya is able to strike at opponents on all sides (ie, four blows each round) and the sight of one wielding four of the jagged scimitars favoured by this species has been known to send disciplined human soldiers fleeing in terror.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hlaka "the Furred Flyers"

WEAPON Melee = 9 damage: 1D10

or TAIL Melee = 9 damage: 1D6

Armour Magic Resistance

Hit Points: **8** [2/3/5] Evade 8

The Hlaka dwell in the mountain caves of Kilalammu, east of Tsolyanu. They are intelligent flying creatures (another interstellar race, like the Ahoggya) with leathery wings and grey or grey-brown fur. The Hlaka have three eyes set in a bony ridge atop their flattish heads. Behind this crest there is a sort of furred ruff which conceals the hearing organs. They have two arms and two legs, but are smaller and lighter than men and move on the ground in a skittish, stooping gait. They also possess a whip-like tail which ends in a bony spike. Being particularly nervous, they will refuse to enter areas such as the Underworld where their ability to fly is hampered. There is roughly a 50% chance of a Hlaka deciding to fly off in moments of danger - particularly if it sees one of its comrades fall - and such is their fear of the sea that they may die of fright if forced to travel on a ship. They hate slavery, and an enslaved Hlaka must be chained or have its wings slashed to prevent it flying off.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hlutrgu "the Swamp Frogs"

WEAPON Melee = 10 damage: 1D10

Armour Magic Resistance

Hit Points: **10** [2/4/6] Evade 9

These swamp-dwellers hate all other species indiscriminately and attack without checking morale. They have four limbs (each with a prehensile hand), skull-like heads and wide fang-filled mouths. Their rubbery bodies are hairless and rotund, patterned with blotches of grey, grey-green or black. They carry barbed darts which they use as spears and javelins. The human nations have been trying to eliminate the Hlutrgu for centuries, and have managed to contain them within the Layoda Swamps around Msumtel Bay. Nonetheless there are still occasional raids on human villages, and pirate attacks against merchant vessels from both Salarvya and Tsolyanu. Such raids are cause for dread, since the Hlutrgu have a particularly ugly reputation for atrocities upon their captives.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hlss "the Spawn of the Old Ones"

WEAPON Melee = 12 damage: 1D10+1

STING Melee = 12 damage: 1D6+1 & poison

Armour Magic Resistance

Hit Points: **15** [3/6/8] Evade 5

This species inhabited Tekumel before the coming of man and other interstellar races. They hate mankind and most other intelligent nonhumans, but are friendly to their cousins the Ssu. Their segmented bodies are armoured with a chitinous exoskeleton that ranges from green-blue to black. They have three limpid black eyes set above a proboscis that conceals a row of razor-sharp mandibles. They walk on four legs, and have two arms and a long scorpion-like tail. The tail ends in a sting, and anyone wounded must attempt a -3 Stamina check. Ordinary failure reduces the victim to one half-action a round; a critical failure (or a second sting) causes paralysis. Popular belief has it that paralysed captives are carried off back to the Isle of the Hlss, there to serve as food for the great Hlss Mother and her young. Hlss live either on their island or upon hive-like ships made from a stony bodily secretion. They are greedy for ancient technological devices and magic weaponry, and any party encountered will include at least one Hluss Lord armed with "Eyes", etc, and having 13 or more levels in its preferred weapon (usually a sword shaped like a lightning bolt). The bodily secretion is also used to cement gems onto the exoskeleton, making a Hlss champion a glittering and magnificent sight.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pachi Lei "the Forest Dwellers"

WEAPON Melee = 10 damage: 1D10

Armour Magic Resistance

Hit Points: **11** [3/4/6] Evade 6

These beings dwell in the forested mountains of the Pan Chaka protectorate, in southwestern Tsolyanu. They are doughy in appearance, with a pear-shaped body and eight articulated limbs each with a prehensile extremity. The upper two pairs of limbs are used as arms, while the lower limbs are used to move and balance in the trees of their jungle homes. Huge, platter shaped eyes give them nocturnal vision. They are enthusiastic and helpful to others, never proud, and have particular affinity for the Pe Choi, whom they call their "northern brothers". If enslaved, Pachi Lei serve docilely but always pine to return to their own kind. The Pachi Lei are generally friendly to humans and sometimes enter Tsolyani society, where they are particularly valued as scouts and border patrol troops. Usually they will opt for one of the special auxiliary units (the Legion of Tangled Root Eaters or the Legion of Deep Green Shadow) but there have been a few cases in history of Pachi Lei generals commanding human troops. Despite their good relationship with humanity, they particularly hate the Mu'ugalavyani. When Mu'ugalavya controlled the Pan Chaka region there were periodic massacres of Pachi Lei which have not been forgotten or forgiven to this day.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pe Choi "the Listeners"

WEAPON Melee = 10 damage: 1D10

Armour Magic Resistance

Hit Points: **12** [3/5/7] Evade 6

These slender creatures, originally mankind's allies from the Procyon star system, have six stick-like limbs and slender graceful bodies covered with light chitin. They stand upon the two rear limbs and use the smaller forelimbs as arms. The head is elongated, elegant with an almost sculpted look, and the eyes are large and green. Pe Choi have sensitive fan-shaped ears and their broader range of hearing enables them to detect even very faint sounds at a range of 60 metres or more. Their intuition and vestigial telepathy allows them to detect traps or hidden beings, etc, within a few metres. They can also tell if any member of their species is slain within a radius of up to 3 Tsan (four kilometres) and if they can determine the murderer's identity they will be implacable in their pursuit. This does not apply to Pe Choi soldiers slain in battle, of course - only to unlawful killing.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Pygmy Folk [own name unpronounceable by humans]

WEAPON Melee = 9 damage: 1D10-1

Armour Magic Resistance

Hit Points: **6** [2/3/4] Evade 10

These little creatures stand only about a metre tall. They have sharp saw-edged beaks, vestigial tails, large ears which can detect sounds through walls up to a metre thick, and glittering black eyes that see easily in pitch darkness. Bipedal, they have two upper arms with four opposable digits. They are covered with sleek grey or black fur. They try to avoid direct battle, preferring traps and ambushes and the security of their underground burrows. However, if cornered they become ferocious and will not retreat, fighting on to the last. Although capricious, greedy and cruel, they must be counted among mankind's friends on Tekumel. Their homeland lies far to the north of Tsolyanu, but they are great travellers and traders; individual Pygmy merchants range throughout the Five Empires, often becoming very rich. (The Tsolyani have a proverb: "To bargain with a Pygmy is to throw away one's purse.")

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Shen "the Demon Warriors"

WEAPON Melee = 16 damage: 1D10+3

or TAIL CLUB Melee = 16 damage: 1D6+3

Armour Magic Resistance

Hit Points: **19** [4/7/10] Evade 3

The Shen are another species that originally came from a different world. Their main enclave, comprising several autonomous states, lies south of Livyanu - a volcanic area where they can enjoy the heat of Tekumel's equator. Their iridescent black scales and dragon-like appearance make them appear to be tall demonic warriors encased in fantastical plate armour. They have hooked beak-like snouts and a glittering crest of slender spines which they can extend or keep flat along their skulls. They walk upon two legs and have two arms, as men do, but they also have a muscular tail with a mace-like appendage of horn at the end. Shen are nominally friendly to man, but one should always be cautious: they are harsh and warlike and given to moments of murderous anger.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Shunned Ones [own name unpronounceable by humans]

WEAPON Melee = 10 damage: 1D10

Armour Magic Resistance

Hit Points: **12** [3/5/7] Evade 6

These inimical beings are rarely seen outside their sealed cities in the foothills of the Pachalim Cliffs in eastern Yan Kor. They are very tall gangling creatures with bony multiple jointed limbs - although they are vaguely humanoid in general form - and they move with an eerie gliding gait. The face resembles a rotting purple fruit, the only features a pair of deep-set pupilless eyes. Shunned Ones emit a hideous stench which humans can detect up to 60 metres away, and this may cause even veteran warriors to flee in panic. This race is a very ancient one, even by Ssu reckoning, and they possibly pre-date the Ssu themselves. They are fearsome practitioners of magic, and leave the isolation of their cities to search for sorcererous devices amid the ancient labyrinths and ruins of the planet. Any party of Shunned Ones encountered will include at least one individual with between 8 and 17 levels in the Sorcerer skill (roll 1D10 and add 7), and this being may have "Eyes", scrolls or other paraphernalia.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ssu "the Enemies of Man"

WEAPON Melee = 12 damage: 1D10+1

Armour Magic Resistance

Hit Points: **14** [3/5/8] Evade 7

This ancient race occupies an area to the north of Salarvya. The Ssu are mankind's deadliest foes, still filled with bitter hatred because humans detroyed the original form of Tekumel. They are tall, slender six-limbed beings wrapped in what looks like grey shrouds (actually a loose integument which is shed continually). The eyes are large and milky-white with no pupils, and the mouth is a stark black slit; there are no other facial features. The usual stance for a Ssu is to stand upon its four rear limbs and hold weapons, etc, in its triple-digeted hands. In this way it can stalk quietly or scuttle quickly in any direction. When fighting, however, Ssu sometimes rear up onto their back legs and use the middle pair of limbs to wield a shield or additional weapon. This allows the creature two blows (or parries) a round, though the second blow is made with the base Melee value and is -1 on damage. For battle they wear a harness of black leather studded with copper plaques and bear black wood shields with raised copper bosses. Ssu smell like musty cinnamon and speak in a high chiming like the sound of bells. They are friendly to the Hlss and may be neutral to Shunned Ones or Hlaka. The present Ssu capital is in Ssuyal, but they yearn to retake the ancient stronghold of Ssuganar, in modern Pechano. Ssu parties range through the human nations seeking magical weaponry to this end. Their ability to pass border garrisons is proverbial, and it is said that they may have access to some tunnel transportation system now lost to mankind. Ssu are fearful magic-users and every group met outside Ssu territory will include at least one with 11-20 levels in the Sorcerer skill. Each Ssu also has the power to hypnotise 1-3 people, who must be within 10 metres and looking in the Ssu's direction. There is a 20% chance of a Ssu attempting to use its hypnotic power in any given round. This counts as its action for the round, and requires the Ssu to make an unmodified Hypnotist skill check. (Assume any Ssu met in human territory will have 7-12 levels in this special skill.) Victims can attempt to resist by making a check based on the average of their Intelligence and highest Complex skill. Failure means that the victim will fight as the Ssu directs, and he can only be freed by the death of the Ssu commanding him. Fortunately the neuter worker-fighters who make up the bulk of Ssu society do not possess this hypnotic ability.

Swamp Folk [own name unpronounceable by humans]

WEAPON Melee = 10 damage: 1D10

Armour Magic Resistance

Hit Points: **11** [3/4/6] Evade 6

The home of this species lies in the miasmal swampland along the lower Putuhenu River in southern Mu'ugalavya. They have stumpy bodies, doughy white in colour, with six limbs which might give the (incorrect) impression that they are related to the Ssu and Hluss. In fact they are friendly to man and are the mainstay of the Mu'ugalavyani navy. Their faces seem somewhat anthropoid, but with a flattened sloping forehead which tapers up into a slender crest. A flexible drapery of skin hangs from the tip of this crest to cover the shoulders and upper back. Although unable to master sorcery, they have a natural ability to detect when things are awry; this extends to sloping passages, hidden chambers and dimensional nexus points. On average the referee should allow a 70% chance of this sense working, though it varies according to unpredictable factors.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tinaliya "the Curious Ones"

WEAPON Melee = 8 damage: 1D10-1

Armour Magic Resistance

Hit Points: **6** [2/3/4] Evade 9

These tiny beings are even shorter than the Pygmy Folk (never more than 75 centimetres tall) and covered with a horny russet coloured integument. They have a pair of long arms and four splayed legs on which the globular body is centrally placed. Tinaliya trade frequently with humans and are always on the lookout for new and interesting artifacts. They are renowned for their courtesy and generosity as well as for their learning. Their subterranean communities are located in central Livyanu, and there are several thousand Tinaliya in the Livyani army. Many serve as sorcerers, for the Tinaliya are perhaps the best magicians of modern Tekumel, but they also form infantry units. When in battle, the courage and military precision of the Tinaliya goes a long way towards compensating for their small stature.

# ANIMALS

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Chlen "the Armour Beast"

BITE Attack = 8 damage: 1D6+1D10

Armour 4 Magic Resistance +5

Hit Points: **30** [6/11/16]

These great, plodding six-legged beasts have flattish horned heads with a splayed beak. The Chlen will fight only if attacked, and in any case is rarely encountered in the wild because of its great importance to human economy. Since iron and steel are prohibitively scarce, the Chlen's horny integument is used in all nations to make armour, tools and weapons. The hide is cut away from the living animal (it grows back within a few weeks) and softened with chemicals so that it can be shaped, then another process is used to harden it for more detailed chiselling and sharpening. The finished product is a light horn like substance which can be as tough as bronze, greenish-black

in its natural state but customarily lacquered in bright colours. Chlen are also used to pull carts and ploughs, but their slowness makes them unsuitable for the transportation of perishable goods. Most commercial transport on Tekumel is done using barges or bearer-slaves.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Chnelh "the Ape-Mutant"

WEAPON Attack = 10 damage: 1D10

Armour 0 Magic Resistance +2

Hit Points: **9** [2/4/5]

These are mutants, created in ancient times by the Priesthood of Ksarul using some member of the ape stock originally brought from Earth. Chnelh are roughly humanoid, with elongated jaws and sharp teeth, a rudimentary nose, and large jewel-like round eyes under beetling brows. They will sometimes attack parties which they considerably outnumber, but usually prefer to avoid confrontation. They fight with club or spear, and although semi intelligent they cannot be trained.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dnelu "the Concealed Leaper"

CLAWS Attack = 18 damage: 1D10+2

TONGUE Attack = 20 damage: 1D10

Armour 3 Magic Resistance +7

Hit Points: **21** [5/8/11] +10 initiative

These hairy, six-legged creatures build underground dens covered with a flap made from grass and twigs. From here they leap out onto passing travellers. This gives the Dnelu the advantage of surprise unless the victim is warned by a premonition or notices the lair (Psychic Ability or Hunter check at -10). Often Dnelu prefer solitary targets, but may kill so quickly that a straggler is dragged into the lair before his friends can get to him; it is then next to impossible to find the lair (Hunter check at -5). Dnelu have slender, rod-like antennae and a barbed prehensile tongue. The tongue cannot be parried and may trap the victim's arms (unmodified Dexterity check to avoid). A Dnelu will only use its claws at the end of round if the tongue hit at its regular initiative phase.

Dzor "the Forest Giant"

CLAWS Attack = 17 damage: 1D10+2D6

BEAK Attack = 17 damage: 1D6+3D6

Armour 3 Magic Resistance +10

Hit Points: **36** [8/13/19] +3 initiative

These forest dwellers are shambling, hairy beasts standing some four metres tall. They are herbivores, grazing the foliage of upper branches in herds of up to twenty. They ignore humans unless attacked, and although semi-intelligent they cannot speak, nor can they be domesticated. They have three round eyes with nictiting lids which give them good night vision; this gives them +3 to Attack at night, but -3 if fighting during the day. A Dzor will strike with its claws (or sometimes a branch or crude stone club) at the regular point in a round, then make a second attack with its horny beak at initiative phase 1.

Anyone hunting Dzor should be armed with a reinforced spear. This is grounded and must be guided into the creature's throat as it charges (it lifts its head as it does, to get the full power of its neck muscles into the beak-strike). This requires a cool head and a steady hand: a Dexterity check at -5 is needed to hit the right spot. If you fail to kill a charging Dzor, you must try to Evade its charge. This is because the charge adds +D6 to its damage bonus, and it will trample you to death if it fells you.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Feshenga "the Many-Legged Serpent"

BITE Attack = 22 damage: 2D6-1

Armour 3 Magic Resistance +3

Hit Points: **15** [3/6/8] +8 initiative

These smooth skinned, oily-looking beasts run on sixty tiny legs, hunting solitarily or in family groups of up to ten. They are fearless and attack anything they see. Their ophidian heads have three rows of needle-sharp teeth, and anyone bitten must make a +5 Stamina check. Failure means that the character will die within five minutes if not treated with a Neutralise Poison spell or an "Eye of Healing".

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hyahyu'u "the Whooper"

BITE Attack = 16 damage: 1D6 +1

or CLAWS Attack = 14 damage: 1D10

Armour 3 Magic Resistance +4

Hit Points: **13** [3/5/7] +5 initiative

These six-legged animals run in packs of twenty or more. They make a weird "hyaa-hyuu" sound which gives them their name. They are covered with tangled black bristles, and their eyes are set under a crest of sticky spines on top of their lozenge shaped skulls. They usually fight humans only if they outnumber a party by at least fifty percent; otherwise they will flee. They will always run off if the party includes a Pachi Lei, as they have a special dread of this nonhuman species.

Kuruku "the Small Giggler"

BITE Attack = 13 damage: 1D2

Armour 1 Magic Resistance +4

Hit Points: **2** [-/1/2] +10 initiative

These little creatures have six legs, like so many of Tekumel's fauna, and they also have a pair of small prehensile claws just beneath their blunt, almost anthropoidal snouts. They never attack and always flee if approached. They do try to snatch bright objects from passing travellers, however, and then run off giggling in a very human fashion. There is a 50% chance of something attracting a Kuruku's attention, and a 40% chance that it will succeed in snatching the object. The item in question is chosen randomly by the referee. The victim can attempt a -10 Dexterity check to react in time to grab the Kuruku, and other characters nearby can make a -15 check. There is a small chance (10%) that the item will be thrown down as the little beast runs away; otherwise it is lost forever unless the Kuruku can be cornered - a difficult task in open forest, since this creature is an agile climber.

Mnor "the Shaggy Insect Creature"

CLUB Attack = 15 damage: 1D10

Armour 4/0 Magic Resistance +4

Hit Points: **12** [3/5/7] +5 initiative

These hairy, twenty-legged creatures will normally try to flee unless they outnumber a group by more than two to one. If attacking or cornered, they fight to the death, using heavy clubs in a semi-intelligent fashion. Their huge faceted eyes are their most vulnerable spot, and a Mnor will turn and flee if a blow shatters an eye. (Assume this for any special hit doing more than a Light Wound in damage.) This species lives communally in lairs of ten to twenty individuals, and since they gather all sorts of glittering objects there is a chance of finding treasure there.

Renyu "the Loyal Follower"

CLAWS Attack = 10 damage: 1D6-1

or BITE Attack = 13 damage: 1D3

Armour 0 Magic Resistance +2

Hit Points: **7** [2/3/4] +3 initiative

These furry humanoids are found mainly in mountain forests, although they are sometimes kept as pets and so may be encountered elsewhere. They have long pointed snouts and sharp upcurved ears, and their large dark eyes give them excellent night vision. Able to communicate in a simple fashion, they can be taught to handle simple tasks - though their intelligence is not enough to safely entrust them with weapons or Eyes! If caught, a Renyu can be taught to serve its captor by an animal trainer. This takes about three months. Renyu are doggedly loyal to their masters, and their keen senses make them useful as guards.

Serudla "the Pale Murderer"

SPIT Missile = 12 (see below)

or BITE Attack = 24 damage: 2D6-2+1D6

or WEAPON Attack = 22 damage: 1D10+5

Armour 5 Magic Resistance +13

Hit Points: **23** [5/9/12] +2 initiative

Perhaps the most feared of all Tekumel's land animals, these huge creatures are rather like armoured dragons. They are covered with gleaming iridescent scales and have the usual six limbs, plus a pair of small arms just below the long neck and massive bony head. Ordinary Serudla are about five metres in length, but the larger varieties said to exist in remote regions can range between eight and twelve metres, and might have up to twice the Hit Points listed above. The Serudla is semi intelligent, and may fight wielding a club or even a sword taken from a previous victim. It can also spew forth a terrible acid spittle which can be used some three times each day. There is a 30% chance of it doing so on any given combat round. It can spit accurately to a distance of 40 metres, and this hits anything within an area three metres across. Characters hit by a Serudla's acid take damage over several rounds: 2-7 points immediately, then 1 point less each round. Armour gives half protection against this, and Chlen-hide armour splashed by the acid will need re-lacquering at the very least. Fortunately, Serudla are not invariably hostile and have been known to cooperate with a human party. The small nation of Ghaton even has a few trained Serudla for use in battle, though no one else has been able to tame these great beasts.

Tsi'il "the Giant Herbivore"

BITE Attack = 10 damage: 1D6+1D10

or TAIL Attack = 8 damage: 1D10+1D10

Armour 4 Magic Resistance +6

Hit Points: **36** [8/13/19]

Despite their ferociously armoured appearance, these are passive gentle creatures who do not harm men unless attacked. They attempt to lumber away instead. They live on preserves maintained by the butchers' clans and are also encountered wild.

Their bodies contain a gland which can be used as a repellant against the Haqel, the Tletlakha and certain other marine creatures. (Concocting this repellant requires an unmodified Alchemist check, and a single gland gives enough to last for about five minutes.) The gland can be sold for 500 Kaitars, and thus these huge herbivores are hunted by men. The Tsi'il has a horny carapace with a spiked crest and rows of jagged spines along its back and flanks. It fights with a flanged bony excrescence at the end of its tail, or by biting with its powerful tooth-ridges.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Zrne "the Barbed One"

BITE Attack = 20 damage: 1D6+3

Armour 2/2 Magic Resistance +5

Hit Points: **21** [5/8/11] +5 initiative

These fierce beasts are about two and a half metres long. They have six legs, a rugose grey-brown hide, and a monstrous head with rows of needle-pointed barbed teeth. These teeth come out easily and remain fixed in a victim's flesh, taking one combat round to remove. If all cannot be removed (60% chance of this) the victim must succeed in an unmodified Stamina check, as the venom these teeth contain will otherwise first make him sluggish (halve normal rate of actions immediately) and then kill him within a minute. Zrne are met in desert and hilly regions. They use their back pair of legs to leap high over obstacles or down from cliff ledges to attack their prey.

Ghar "the Armoured River Monster"

BITE Attack = 18 damage: 1D10 (& see below)

or TAIL Attack = 12 damage: 1D10+5

Armour 6/2 Magic Resistance +8

Hit Points: **32** [7/12/17]

These heavily armoured beasts are mostly river or seashore dwellers. They are found all along the southern coasts from Nufersh, in Livyanu, to the Msumtel Bay and even further east. Ghar are not gregarious, and are usually met singly or in groups of two or three. They possess three powerful sets of jaws hidden in protected cavities beneath their carapace, and they can extrude these to a distance of 3 metres. They can thus hit three times in one round - ie, the Ghar gets a single Attack roll but if successful it scores three separate hits on the target, each for 1D10. It also has a spiked tail which it uses against any attacker approaching from the rear. Fully-grown Ghar are about 4-5 metres long and have turtle-like shells. The inside of the shell is iridescent and rather like mother-of pearl, and it is worth between 500 and 1000 Kaitars.

Aqaa "the Worm of the Catacombs"

BITE Attack = 16 damage: 1D10+6

TAIL Attack = 13 damage: 1D6+2D6

Armour 4/2 Magic Resistance +10

Hit Points: **40** [8/14/21] Evade 2

This huge accordion-shaped worm is considered sacred by the Priests of Sarku, who sometimes maintain them in pits beneath their clandestine temples. The Aqaa ranges from six to twenty metres in length. There is a 20% chance of a small specimen (20 30 HP), 50% chance of a medium-sized one (30-50 HP), and 30% chance of a very large one (50-70 HP). It is covered with ragged brown bristles and has a maw as big as a man. Anyone bitten has a 30% chance of swallowed: if this is indicated (by a roll of 1-30 on percentile dice) the victim takes no immediate damage from the bite, but is instead sucked into the maw. He must try to cut his way out through the beast's horny hide before its digestive juices reduce him to mush. This is only possible if he has an edged weapon to hand and can succeed in a Strength/Dexterity check at -5. Each round he remains inside the Aqaa, he takes 1D10 damage with armour giving no protection. The victim can also be cut out from the stomach by companions at the side, if they are armed with cutting weapons and can inflict wounds exceeding half the Aqaa's Hit Points in a single round. (But watch out for the tail, which can swing on any round as well as the mouth and strikes up to two opponents simultaneously!) Even after getting free, the victim will continue to take 1 HP damage per round for the next 1-6 rounds while the digestive juices are cleaned off him; vinegar or wine are particularly suitable for this. Scarring is very probable, and must be treated with HealingU8. Revivification is possible for a slain victim, but a -3 modifier is applied to the caster's chance of success.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Biridlu "the Mantle"

BITE Attack = 16 damage: 1D6+3

or ENVELOP Evade = 10 damage: see below

Armour 3/2 Magic Resistance +7

Hit Points: **13** [-/-/-] +5 initiative

These ancient treasure guardians are cape-like, black flying creatures which cling to ceilings and drop down upon the unwary. They nearly always surprise their victim (allow a -10 Psychic Ability check to see if a premonition warns him) and then attempt to suffocate him in their powerfully muscled folds. Enveloping a victim involves a close combat attack based on the Biridlu's Evade score, and this cannot be parried unless the opponent has a steel edged weapon. Biridlu cannot be cut by Chlen-hide weapons but only by steel. Steel edged weapons do full damage; steel maces, etc, and all chlen hide weapons do half damage (after deduction for the creature's tough hide); missile weapons score quarter damage if not steel tipped, and cannot impale. Once the Biridlu has caught a victim it begins to crush the life out of him, gibbering and shrieking as it does. The character takes 1D6 damage on the first round, 2D6 on the second, and 3D6 on the third; armour will give half its regular protection against this. If the victim has a steel dagger he may be able to fight the creature off - this requires a Dexterity check at -2 on the first round, -4 on the next, etc. Colleagues at the side can also try to cut their friend free. This requires a normal hit and is successful only when the beast is slain. The Biridlu fights maniacally until all life is gone from it, and its body must be burned, otherwise it regenerates within 6 combat rounds.

Hli'ir "the Beast with the Unendurable Face"

TALONS Attack = 22 damage: 1D6+3

BITE Attack = 26 damage: 1D6+1

Armour 3/2 Magic Resistance +9

Hit Points: **25** [5/9/13] +5 initiative

These mad creatures are hideous to look upon, and anyone who does so may go insane. Characters encountering a Hli'ir must attempt a Dexterity check at -10 to look away in time; a character can choose to average his Dexterity with his Sorcerer or Demonologist skill for the purpose of this check. Characters who fail the Dexterity check have looked into the Hli'ir's face. They must make a Psychic Ability check (at +5 if the character was taken by surprise) and if successful they go insane. (This represents the fact that the horror instilled by this creature's mad visage will affect a psychic character more acutely.) In the case of a critical success the insanity is permanent; otherwise the victim recovers in 2-12 days, though persistent phobias and nervousness are probable. A person who is driven mad is most likely to turn on his comrades in a berserk rage - alternatively he might follow the Hli'ir in an insane prancing dash through the catacombs. Hli'ir sometimes rush right by or through a party without stopping to melee. If a Hli'ir does fight, it must be slain with steel weapons. Chlen-hide weaponry will not actually inflict wounds (ie remove Hit Points) but can still cause pain to the Hli'ir and may stun it. For chlen-hide weapons, figure the damage for the blow normally but do not deduct this from the monster's Hit Points - however, if the damage would have been sufficient to cause a Heavy or Grievous Wound, the Hli'ir will need to make the appropriate Stamina check to avoid being immobilised for 1-6 rounds.

Hra

SWORD Attack = 23 damage: 1D10+5

or LANCE Attack = 20 damage: 2D5+5

Armour 6/2 Magic Resistance +18

Hit Points: **30** [-/-/-] +1 initiative

These are the creations of the ancient Priests of Ksarul. They are reanimated undead, and they can only be destroyed by touching them with the Amulet of the Good God after they have been "slain" - ie, reduced to zero Hit Points or less. Otherwise they reanimate within one 4kiren5 (thirty minutes) and will track their prey as a 15th level Hunter. Hra drain their victims of all blood and bodily fluids, leaving nothing but a shrivelled husk. These great, grey undead monsters fight as men do with swords and lances, and the Priests of Ksarul still sometimes employ them in night battles (they cannot stand the light). A priest of Ksarul has a chance of controlling any Hra he encounters by making a -5 Theologian check; on ordinary success the creature will not harm the priest, a critical success it obeys his orders to the limit of its understanding. This control must be gained on the first round after encountering the Hra, and if it surprises the priest's group then it is not possible.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Huru'u "the Howler"

TOUCH Attack = 16 damage: 1D6 (& see below)

Armour 0 Magic Resistance +11

Hit Points: **15** [-/-/-] +5 initiative

These spectral undead wander howling in the Underworld. They can be heard at a distance of fifty metres, and they perceive a party from this distance too. Their howling deafens all within 3 metres of them. Characters this close to a Huru'u must make a check based on the average of Intelligence and highest Complex skill; ordinary failure sends the character fleeing in panic for 1-10 rounds, while a critical failure means he is petrified with fear, remaining immobile till attacked. After the encounter, the deafness will persist for at least 10-60 minutes and may even be permanent (15% chance of this). Chlen-hide weapons do

-2 damage against Huru'u. Their touch passes right through chlen-hide (including a parrying weapon) but will not harm a character in steel armour. The wounds they inflict will not heal naturally and must be treated by magic. They can be driven off by a Protection from Evil spell or by fire (40% chance on any given combat round). Anyone slain by a Huru'u and later resurrected loses one level from each of his skills.

Marashyalu "the Whimperer"

CLAWS Attack = 19 damage: 1D6+4

Armour 2 Magic Resistance +15

Hit Points: **16** [4/6/9] Stamina 20? +9 init

These supernatural creatures of the ancients were set to guard the treasure of buried kings. They are masters of illusion - often appearing as children, women or wounded friends - and they weep, imploring help. The Marashyalu can also captivate victims with its powers of hypnosis, which requires anyone within 3m to make a check based on the average of Intelligence and highest Complex skill. Ordinary failure deprives the character of all volition, while a critical failure lets the Marashyalu command him to fight against his own companions. Victims of Marashyalu can only be cured by the passage of time (a new check is allowed each hour) or by a spell of Remove Curse. If the Marashyalu suceeds in carrying off a victim, it sucks all the soft organs out of his body by inserting a long proboscis into the mouth or another orifice. This modifies the roll required for Revivification by -2. These vicious creatures can be driven off by a Protection from Evil spell.

Mrur "the Undead"

SWORD Attack = 14 damage: 1D10

Armour 4/0 Magic Resistance +10

Hit Points: **9** [-/-/-] Evade 4

These are the corpses of warriors who perished in the Underworld and were reanimated by the Priests of Sarku or Ksarul for their own purposes. Scarcely more than age-yellowed bones held together by clumps of mouldering skin and cartilage, Mrur retain little of the intelligence they possessed in life, and must usually be controlled by a Jajgi overseer.

Qol "the Serpent-Headed Ones"

WEAPON Melee = 13 damage: 1D10 & venom

BITE Attack = 16 damage: 1D6 & venom

Armour 4/0 Magic Resistance +3

Hit Points: **11** [3/4/6] +5 initiative

These bluish-white mutants from human stock were created in the Latter Times and employed by the Priests of Ksarul, Hru'u and Sarku. They are roughly humanoid except for a slender reptilian neck with a flat diamond-shaped ophidian head, and the fact that their arms end in tentacles in place of hands. They see well in darkness but fear bright light. They use poisoned weapons (including arrows) and can also bite with deadly effect on the same combat round. A character who is wounded must make a Stamina check to avoid taking an extra 2D6 damage from the venom. This check is unmodified in the case of a bite, and at +2 if wounded by a poison-coated weapon. Qol will not attack unless they outnumber a party; otherwise they attempt to flee.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Qumqum "the Thunderer"

POLEARM Attack = 24 damage: 1D10+7

Armour 2 Magic Resistance +26

Hit Points: **40** [8/14/21] Evade 6

This spectral creature is invisible to humans but not to a Pe Choi. It can be heard coming, however, at a distance of 150 metres, since it makes a terrible roaring noise as it moves. The Qumqum fights invisibly with a sort of heavy poleaxe forged long ago by the Brethren of the Scarlet Nail, a sect within the Priesthood of Sarku. It can be driven off by an Eye of Detestation or controlled by the Incomparable Eye of Command (if it fails a Magical Resistance roll) but is otherwise immune to mind-influencing devices or spells. It can be repelled by fire (10%-40% chance, depending on the size and intensity of the blaze) and can also be forced to retreat if it fails a Stamina check due to wounds - it cannot be rendered unconscious. Since it is invisible, creatures other than a Pe Choi melee it at -6.

Ru'un "the Demon of Bronze"

SWORD Melee = 32 damage: 1D10+4

BOLT GUN Missile = 16 damage: 1D6+4

Armour 4/2 Magic Resistance +22

Hit Points: **30** [6/11/16] Evade 6

These are manlike bronze automatons which the ancients long ago set to guard certain treasures and dimensional nexus points. They are highly intelligent, although they will not communicate with men. They are more than two metres tall and their bodies are covered with a fine network of hair-thin wires which impart a powerful electric shock. An opponent striking the Ru'un must make an unmodified Stamina check to avoid taking 1D3 damage (no armour protection) and being stunned for 1-3 rounds. The following modifiers apply: -1 for using a shortsword or smaller weapon, +2 for a long weapon (spear or polearm), -3 if weapon is made of steel rather than chlen-hide. Ru'un fight with a broad bladed steel sword in one appendage and a kind of throwing device attached to the other arm which casts metal bolts up to twenty metres. The Ru'un obeys only the "Incomparable Eye of Command" and the Amulet of Ruling the Ru'un. These creatures can see invisible planes and hear sounds inaudible even to Pe Choi; they thus cannot be surprised.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sagun "the Fungus"

TENDRILS Attack = 29 damage: 1D10+1D6

Armour 2 Magic Resistance +10

Hit Points: **35** [-/-/-] Evade 1

This is in reality a form of ambient fungus developed by the ancients as a killer-guardian. Standing about 2.5 metres tall, this pallid tubular creature sways forward upon its mobile stalk, reaching out to strike with woody claw-like tendrils that sprout from its convoluted foliations. It also emits spores (60% chance of doing this on any combat round) and opponents in melee must make an unmodified Dexterity check to avoid breathing them in. These spores are poisonous, and a -2 Stamina check is needed by anyone inhaling them; if this fails, they will germinate inside the victim's lungs unless a Cure Disease spell or the Eye of Healing is applied within three rounds. The effect is to permanently reduce the victim's Stamina by 1D10 points - killing him if this reduces the Stamina score to zero.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Shedra "the Eater of the Dead"

WEAPON Melee = 16 damage: 1D10

Armour 4/0 Magic Resistance +13

Hit Points: **11** [-/-/-] +5 initiative

These are flesh-eating undead, the reanimated corpses of ancient warriors. Grey and shrivelled almost beyond human form, they wander ceaselessly in the Underworld seeking food. They bear antique arms and armour (usually of bronze, but sometimes steel or magical copper) and a person slain by one of them will himself become a Shedra unless a Remove Curse spell is applied within six rounds. Once a victim has become a Shedra only a Wish spell or Divine Intervention will return him to living form.

Thunru'u "the Eater of Eyes"

or GRAPPLE Attack = 24 damage: 1D10-1D6+4

Armour 2 Magic Resistance +8

Hit Points: **23** [5/9/12] Evade 9

This archaic life form dwells now in the Underworld away from the sight of men. It is humanoid in general form, but larger than most men, doughy and blubbery looking, with pasty-white flesh that hangs from its frame in bulbous rolls. Set in deep ridges of waxy cartilage, its large saucer-like eyes enable it to see well in darkness, and it has a greyish beak which opens and closes continually as the creature breathes. Thunru'u prefer to slay the Kayi (qv) but they will attack men in order to eat the eyes, relishing these over all other fare. Immensely strong, they fight either with weapons or by attacking a foe with their bare hands. Assume them to be equivalent to 8th level Wrestlers when grappling (see Section 471). They always attack, but can sometimes (40% chance) be repelled by the odour of fresh Tsural buds, a common aphrodisiac on sale in most Tsolyani marketplaces. (Characters ought to make a +5 Sorcerer or Scholar check to be aware of this aversion, which is hardly common knowledge.) Thunru'u are associated with the Temples of the Dark Trinity (Ksarul, Sarku and Hru'u) and are occasionally found as servitors of a magician or priest of one of these deities.

Tsu'uru "the Illusion-Master"

WEAPON Melee = 28 damage: 1D10

Armour 2 Magic Resistance +15 vs Eyes

Hit Points: **22** [5/8/12] +20 initiative

These are also treasure guardians created by the ancients and related to the Marashyalu. They appear as anything they wish, using a form of ESP to determine what characters are most likely to believe. They maintain this illusion until they are slain, whereupon they revert to their own forms - a bundle of ropy, lumpy tentacles with a central brain ganglion. They may thus appear as a Ru'un, as a friend known to the party, etc, etc, and only after they have attacked and have been slain do they appear as they really are. In a battle the Tsu'uru has its own Hit Points and other characteristics, not those of the being it is imitating. These creatures are totally immune to spells, and no form of ESP, clairvoyance, telepathy or other magic will reveal their true identity. The Tsu'uru may dissimulate for a time, pretending to be a friendly character, and accompany the party until it sees a chance to attack with maximum effect.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yeleth "the Angel of Doom"

WEAPON Melee = 12 damage: 1D10

Armour 2/0 Magic Resistance +12

Hit Points: **11** [3/4/6] +5 initiative

These androids were created to look like beautiful maidens or handsome youths. They have paper-white skin and hair the colour of polished ebony. Their main weapon is the ability to hypnotise 1-6 beings per combat round, who must be within 6m and looking in the Yeleth's direction. The attempt to hypnotise takes one full round, and the attempt to resist is rolled for at the end of the round. This requires a check based on the average of the character's Intelligence and highest Complex skill. The modifier is -1 for each Yeleth that is trying to hypnotise the character in that round. The victim of a Yeleth's hypnosis can be caused to fight his own companions, or the creature may simply paralyse him forever. Only a spell of Alleviation (G4) or Healing (G5), or a charge from the Eye of Healing, can remove the hypnosis.
