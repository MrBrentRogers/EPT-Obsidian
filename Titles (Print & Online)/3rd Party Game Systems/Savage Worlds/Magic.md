**Magic:**

Perhaps the most problematic considerations when writing a Savage World's conversion of _Tekumel: Empire Of The Petal Throne_ was how to handle magic. Magic is a powerful and very regulated force on Tekumel and most of the previous games for this setting have very elaborate magic rules to reflect this. While some spells are universally known, other spells are restricted to various temples and are only taught to the most promising (or socially well-connected) adepts. Simulating the vast number of spells available in Tekumel along with their various restrictions while keep the game Fast, Furious, and Fun was a great challenge. However, drawing from the work of other Savages

Magic in SWotPT uses the same rules found in the Savage Worlds: Explorer's Edition with the following changes--

**Arcane Background and Skills**: Magic uses the standard Arcane Background (Magic) and Spellcasting skill found in the Savage Worlds: Explorers Edition. Because magic is usually the pervue of the Temples, a D6 requirement in Knowledge (Religion) is now a requirement. Starting chararacters have 3 Powers and 10 Power Points. The Backlash rule can be ignored.

**Inscribed Spells:** With the proper knowledge, Tekumelyani spell casters can magically impart a spell onto a piece of parchment or book for later use. This also makes it possible for any player to cast magical spells provided they can read the instructions. In order to cast an Inscribed Spell, the character must be able to read whatever language the spell is written in, and pass a Smarts Check. If they suceed, the spell is cast. Whenever a Inscribed Spell is used, the spell's instructions fade from the parchment and the spell can't be used again.

_Inscription_, the Power to create Inscribed Spells, can be found below.

**Magic and Armor:** Spell casters can wear light Chlen-hide or leather armor, but anything heavier restricts their movement to a point where spellcasting is impossible.

**Metal and Spellcasting:** Metal and Magic do not usually mix on Tekumel. Even having a small amount on a spellcaster's person can disrupt the extra-planar energies they are trying to control and kill them. Any character wearing or touching more than 60 grams of metal when casting any spell, not only will it automatically fail, the caster must make a Spirit Check or become instantly Incapacitated. Inscribed Spells are lost regardless of the result.

**Some Notes about Core Powers:**

Some slight changes have been made to some of the core powers to help them better fit into the Tekumel setting.

**Healing/Greater Healing**

While Healing and Greater Healing can only heal physcial wounds, it can not cure disease, poisions, or paralysis. (See Alleviate in New Powers section.) Also, since the doesn't appear to be a time-limit involved in magical healing in the Tekumel setting, the concept of "The Golden Hour" is ignored.

Greater Healing can be used to eliminate permanent injuries: however, this is very difficult and .
