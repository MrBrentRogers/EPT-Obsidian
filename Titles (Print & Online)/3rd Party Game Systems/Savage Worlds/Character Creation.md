Character Creation:

The Races Of Tékumel:

There are many different sentient beings that populate Tékumel. The inimical Ssú and Hlüss are native to the planet. Then there are the star-faring species that, along with humanity, colonized Tékumel long before the Time of Darkness. All, human and alien alike, have degenerated from their ultra-technological past into barbarism after the cataclysm that dragged Tékumel from its home universe.

**Limited Attributes**: Many of the races have Limited Attributes: Players must spend 2 points to raise an Attribute during character creation and require two Advances during game play.

**Variable Outsider Hindrance:** While most non-human species are not trusted among their human neighbors, some races are less trusted than others. Therefore the Outsider Hindrance varies from species to species.

**Ahoggya: “The Knobbed Ones”**

Standing 1.41 to 1.60m in height, Ahoggyá have thick, knobby, furry, barrel-shaped bodies under an armored shell on the top. Under this shell, there are four equidistantly positioned arms that end with hands with three thick fingers and a thumb. Four pairs of independently movable eyes and other sensory organs are positioned between the arms with a large fanged mouth on one of the sides. At the bottom of the torso are four, muscular, bowed legs. Excretory and reproductive organs--Ahoggyá have 8 sexes--are located under the body. They are noted for their exceptional strength and toughness, but not for their dexterity or intelligence.

Culturally, Ahoggyá are crude and gruff, and have little regard for customs and mores that are not their own. They do not join human clans, they have no interest in religion, and they have little talent for sorcery. It is also said that they have a taste for the flesh of humans dead. They are willing to leave their swampy enclaves in the south to serve as mercenaries or auxiliaries for the Five Empires. They have an ancient enmity with the Shén, and any long-term meeting between the two races will quickly degenerate into violence. Ahoggyá names of often unpronounceable to humans, so they usually take some form of nickname to identify themselves among humans. They also don't smell very pleasant, and, frankly, they don't care.

- 360° Vision: Having four pairs of eyes set all around their bodies, Ahoggyá can't be attacked from behind--they don’t have one. Also, opponents get a -1 gang up to any bonus.
- Dumb and Clumsy: Ahoggyل have Limited Attributes in Smarts and Dexterity.
- Extra Arms: Ahoggyá four arms. They can make an extra non-movement action without penalty. They can use two handed weapons while using a shield or/and a one handed weapon in the other two. Ahoggyá can also attack to their rear without penalty.
- Natural Armor: The Ahoggyá thick, armored carapace affords it a +2 Armor to its torso.
- Outsider: Their rude manner, disgusting habits, and stench give Ahoggyá a Charisma penalty of -4 when in the xenophobic human societies.
- Strong and Tough: Ahoggyá start is a d6 in Strength and Vigor.
- Racial Enemy (Shén): Due to an ancient argument, relations between the Ahoggyá and the Shén are less than cordial to say the least. Ahoggyá suffer a -6 modifier to their Charisma when attempting to use Persuasion or Intimidation on a Shén character. Rolling a one of the associated Skill die will prompt the Shén to attack the Ahoggyá immediately. Also, if a party has a Ahoggyá in their ranks, NPC Reaction rolls with Shén characters suffer a -4 penalty.

Names: The gurgling, gobbling language of the Ahoggyá is impossible for humans to speak, so humans tend to give them nicknames: e.g. Barrel of Swords. Gray Face, Old Kettle Belly, Red Eyes, etc.

Clans: Ahoggyá are never allowed membership to Tsolyáni clans, which suits the Ahoggyá fine because they would never want to join.

**Hláka: “The Furred Fliers”**

Hláka have slender bodies with six limbs: two arms, two legs and a pair of long leathery wings. They stand 1.5 meters in height and each wing spans about 5 meters. They have flat, round heads with heavy brow, 3 eyes, and a muzzle filled with pointed teeth. Their bodies are covered in grayish or brownish fur with a strong, prehensile tail ending with a bony, rapier-like barb that the Hláka usually poison before combat.

Hláka have two sexes: male (55% of the population) and female (45%) that mate monogamously. Curious and friendly, Hláka come to Tsolyánu to serve as aerial scouts and mercenaries, but will eventually wish to return to their homes and families. They have their own odd religion that involves placing colored stones on flat mountaintops at certain astronomically predicted times.

- Flight: The leathery wings of the Hláka grant them a base flying speed of 12 inches with a “run” of d10. Taking the Fleet of Foot Edge increases this to 15 inches with a d12 “run.”
- Natural Weapons: Hláka have a rapier like barb at the end of their long tails that can inflict a Strength+1d4 damage. The Hláka also have a tendency to poison this barb.
- Outsider: Like most aliens in Tsolyánu, Hláka are seen as second class citizens by most humans. They suffer a -2 penalty to Charisma.
- Fragile and Weak: Hláka have Limited Attributes in Strength and Toughness due to their hollow bones and lithe physiques.

Names: Examples of Hláka names include: Dzá, Iwa Ae’eya, Naaia-eya, Sua-eya.

Clans: Hláka do not usually stay long enough in Tsolyánu society to join a clan.

**Humans:**

Humans, the dominate species of Tékumel, are ethnically homogeneous and have evolved from the tropical peoples of long-forgotten Earth. (Caucasoid humans were destroyed in some ancient war or catastrophe.) Males stand an average of 1.68 m in height while females average 1.57 m. Male skin tones tend to be reddish, copper color, while women tend to be slightly lighter hued. Eyes are brown or black. Blue eyes, a rare mutation, are considered to be disfigurement and a curse from Lady Avánthe. (See Hindrances below.) Hair is usually straight and black--there are no blonds or redheads. There are few exceptions: Salarvyáni skin is sallow and they have more body hair (particularly long curly beards for men), the sea-faring Nóm have jet-black skin, and the N’lüss of the far North are much stronger and paler.

- Free Edge: Humans begin play with a free edge of their choice. They must meet the requirement of the Edge.

Names: Tsolyáni names have the individuals name first followed by their family linage name: e.g. Achán hiNidráne, Mára hiKúrodu, etc. Members of the Tlakotáni, Ito, and Vríddi clans use their clan name instead of their linage, and members Tlakotáni who are close members of the Imperial family omit the “hi” prefix (e.g. Hirkáne Tlakotáni, 61st Seal Emperor).

**Páchi Léi: “The Forest Dwellers”**

Páchi Léi have a gray-green, pear-shaped body and stands between 1.5 to 2 meters in height. They have an artichoke-shaped head with large, round eyes and a toothy, beak-like muzzle. Like the Ahoggyá, They have four arms and legs, but can only use their arms for frontal attacks. Páchi Léi can see well in the dark and they have a psychic ability to sense danger. Páchi Léi are asexual and reproduce by releasing airborne spores that cling to "egg buds" on the bodies of others of their species.

Living along the forested western border between Tsolyánu and Mu'ugalayá the Páchi Léi have been pushed by the invading Mu'ugalayáni further and further east into Tsolyánu. Despite their physical differences, Páchi Léi tend to get along in Tsolyáni society than most non-humans. Many have even found their way into human clans and the legions.

Pé Chói have a well developed senses of hearing and vision, as well as a basic form of telepathy. This also makes them particularly adept at magic. Because their breathing organs are located on their lower abdomens they can drown in even very shallow pools, and fear large bodies of water. Humans find Pé Chói physically beautiful and have the easiest time relating to these aliens of all the non-humans on Tékumel.

- Natural Armor: The exoskeleton of the Pé Chói grants them a +1 Armor to their entire body.

They have two upper limbs with three fingered hands and a vestigial tail. Their scenes of sight, smell, and hearing are exceptional; they can see in complete darkness and can hear the faintest sound even through a stone wall. There are three sexes: Males (55%), females (15%), and hermaphrodites (30%).

The one known enclave of this species is located in the northeastern mountains of Yán Kór where they live in vast underground burrows. The Tsolyáni call them “Ninínyal” meaning “the Little Ones” (Yán Koryáni: Nyena). While friendly to humans, they have a tendency to be cruel, devious, and greedy.

Shén are also are armed with razor-sharp claws and a mace-like growth on the end of their long tails that they can use like a club! Coming from the intensely hot lands south of Tsolyánu, Shén can resist temperatures that can kill a human. Despite their mighty strength and constitution, they tend to be slow in body and mind.

Shén don't usually care to leave their sweltering equatorial homelands for the “colder” lands of the north and when they do it is not usually for long. However, Shén can be found in serving in the auxiliary legions and as bodyguards. Shén do not usually make apt statesmen or sorcerers.

**Heroes of Tékumel:**

There are many paths on Tékumel for in your player’s quest for glory, honor, and fortune. While many will no doubt assume the standard fantasy character roles (e.g. fighters, magic-users, clerics, etc), the richness of the Empire Of The Petal Throne setting along with the versatility of the Savage Worlds rules allows players to step outside of the traditional RPG paradigm and try out new characters. Please consider these and other character types while generating your PC:

**Fighters:** Tékumel is a dangerous world and Tsolyánu has its share of enemies, human and non-human. The God Emperor needs brave men and women to serve in his legions to defend and expand its borders. Professional warriors also include clan house and temple guards, gladiators, duelists, and other, mercenaries.

**Priests:** Religion plays a major role in human society throughout the Tsolyánu Empire, from lower level clerics who handle the day to day operations of their temple to powerful priests who can call upon the powers of their deity to aid them. There are many clerics who serve the gods of Stability and Change: the fanatical warrior-priests of Karakán and Vimúhla, the hedonistic clergy of Lady Dlamélish, the scholar priests of Lords Thúmis and Ksárul, the powerful necromancers who serve Lord Sárku, and others.

**Magicians**: In the pocket-universe where Tékumel exists, the Skin of Reality is thinner and there are those who can call upon the power of the Planes Beyond to serve them. Most magicians are lay-priests who devote themselves to a particular god, but have no role in the temple hierarchy. Other magic users can range from talented dabblers who wish to emulate the sorcerers of the Epics like Súbadim and Nyélmu, to the Milumanayáni shamans of the Desert of Sighs.

**Thieves:** A life of crime is a dangerous career choice in Tsolyánu where justice for can eventually be dealt out at the end of the impaler’s stake. Yet, there those make a living as cut purses, buglers, confidence tricksters, and plunderers of the tombs and treasures of the Underworld. One must be skilled and lucky lest they end up taking the “High Ride” or worse.

**Imperial Bureaucrats**: The God Emperor or of Avanthár is mighty, but even he cannot rule Tsolyánu alone. Beneath him are a multitude of high clan nobles, clerks, scribes, scholars, and other officials who keep the empire running and can open the right doors when necessary.

**Spies:** Intrigue is major theme of the Tékumel setting. The agents of the Omnipresent Azure Legions are everywhere, gathering information about Tsolyánu’s allies and enemies (within and outside of the Empire) and bringing them to the ears of the God Emperor and his advisors. The temples and higher clans also have their own agents who serve their employer's varied interests.

**Assassins**: Life is cheap on Tékumel, but taking it can be a lucrative business. You strike at your employer’s enemies from the shadows with garrote, poisoned darts, daggers, and other weapons. If you're caught, it could mean taking the High Ride while your employer will only have to pay Shámatl (i.e. blood money) to your target's clan.

**Commoners**: Even the most humble Tsolyáni citizen can find themselves in an adventure. Farmers, potters, glass blowers, clan wives, and even slaves can find themselves thrust into extraordinary circumstances.

Characters are assumed to be citizens of Tsolyánu; however, characters from outside the Empire are possible. However, there are negative consequences to being a foreigner inside Tsolyánu.

**Character Creation:**

Creating a PC follows the same process found in Savage Worlds Explorer’s Edition with a few minor changes.

**Race:**

First you must choose a race. While humans are the dominant species on Tékumel, you can choose one of the other races found above. Keep in mind that the Tsolyáni tend to be quite xenophobic, and while it’s possible for non-humans to rise to great heights in the Empire, they are not entirely trusted.

**Traits:**

When you’ve decided what sort of PC you want to play, you must now determine your character’s traits.

**Attributes:** Unless your race’s description states otherwise, each character starts with a d4 in each of its five attributes: Agility, Smarts, Spirit, Strength, and Vigor. You have 5 points to distribute among them. Raising an attribute costs one point per die type. You cannot raise an attribute beyond d12 with the exception of races with advanced Attributes and some Edges.

**Skills:** Your character has 15 points to buy skills. Raising a skill by a die costs 1 point as long as it’s no higher than the attribute it’s linked to. It costs 2 points level to raise a skill over its linked attribute. Most of the standard skills are available. For more information on any changes read page XX.

**Religion**: Religion is a major part of life on Tékumel and your character now needs to choose what deity they follow. While aliens have their own religions, Tsolyáni humans follow one of the gods or cohort deities of the Pavár’s pantheon. Whether these are merely powerful inter-dimensional beings or gods is the truest sense is not known, but their power cannot be denied and they are worshiped throughout Tsolyánu as well as other empires, often under different names. There are the five Gods of Stability, or Tlomitlányal, and the five Gods of Change, or Tlokiriqáluyal. Each god has a lesser respective cohort deity, or Hlimékluyal. Also, each deity has numerous avatars, or "Aspects," that are considered to be a manifestation of that god.

**Gods of Stability (Tlomitlányal)**

**Hnálla:** Supreme god of order.

**Karakán:** God of war for the sake of civilization.

**Thúmis:** God of knowledge for the good of society.

**Avánthe:** Goddess of nature, family, motherhood, and the cycle of life.

**Belkhánu:** God of the afterlife and travelers.

**Cohorts of Stability**

**Drá:** Cohort to Hnálla. Total indifference to the world, the worship to Lord Hnálla.

**Chegárra:** Cohort to Karakán. Martial virtues, heroism, and statesmanship.

**Keténgku:** Cohort to Thúmis. Healing, applied science, writing, and art.

**Dilinála:** Cohort to Avánthe. Femininity, sisterhood, virginity, lesbianism.

**Qón:** Cohort to Belkhánu. Protection of the soul in the afterlife, combating demons and the undead.

**Gods of Change (Tlokiriqáluyal**)

**Hrü’ü:** Supreme god of chaos.

**Vimúhla**: God of war for the sake of destruction.

**Ksárul:** God of knowledge for selfish use and magic.

**Dlamélish**: Goddess of hedonism and selfishness.

**Sárku:** God of the undead.

**Cohorts of Change**

**Wurú:** Cohort of Hrü’ü. Darkness and combating Stability.

**Chiténg:** Cohort of Vimúhla. Violence, pillage, cruelty, and torment.

**Grugánu:** Cohort of Ksárul: Magical devices, sorcery, extra-planer travel.

**Hriháyal:** Cohort of Dlamélish. Debauchery, greed, extreme sexuality. carnal ecstasy.

**Durritlámish:** Cohort of Sárku. Tombs, decay, the undead and other creatures of the Underworld.

For more information on the religions of Tsolyánu see Chapter XX. The author highly recommends Mitlányal (in Two Volumes) by Robert Alberti and M.A.R. Barker, published by Zottola Publishing. Volume 1: The Gods of Stability details the specifics on the beliefs and rituals of the Tlomitlányal, while Volume 2: The Gods of Change deals with the worship and rites of the Tlokiriqáluyal.

**Clan:** All human characters are automatically assumed to be a member of a medium level clan. Edges and Hindrances can place you into a higher or lower clan. Your character can also take the Nakomé Hindrance, but there are serious consequences that come with that choice (See Hindrances). Your clan affiliation helps determine your character's Charisma (see below) as well as their starting resource points (see Gear). Since many clans worship a particular deity and/or perform a particular task for Tsolyáni society, your clan membership can also help determine your character's religious or occupational status.

Languages:

The xenophobic nature of the Tsolyáni people makes them insular and usually not trusting of foreigners and non-humans. Therefore, many don’t usually see any reason why they should have to learn the tongues of those who dwell outside of the Empire. However, there times when knowing another language can be useful if only just to tell a Yán Koryáni soldier that they are about to die.

Human characters speak their native language-usually Modern Tsolyáni-and may know one extra language per level of smarts above d4. For example: a character with d8 in Smarts may know three languages. This can be altered by Edges and Hindrances. With a few notable exceptions, alien languages are too incomprehensible for humans to learn. Non-human characters are assumed to speak their own species language as a default and must learn all others. With a few notable exceptions, humans are incapable of speaking non-human tongues.

Languages available to PCs include:

Money:

Money is handled a little differently in SWPT than in other settings. Instead of hard currency, characters receive Resource Points that they can use to initially obtain weapons, armor, and equipment from their clans. The amount of Resource Points depends on the Character's clan (the higher the clan, the more resources it has to offer) and linage (scions of more prestigious lineages can expect better access to their clan's resources):

Gear: Characters are assumed to have some basic processions: clothing appropriate to their clan and career.
