For those of you who do not know _Empire of the Petal Throne_ was created by M.A.R. Barker from a world he had created as a boy. It was the second roleplaying game ever and also was the second game created by TSR, Inc. The system used a variant of the original 'White Box' D&D game. If you think _Dark Sun_ is exotic, then you will be surprised at the depth and breadth of this world. M.A.R. Barker has created a world totally unlike our own. The races are unlike anything that has appeared anywhere else and there are several languages created for the game.

**Note**

The following assumes you have access to Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition core books, The Player's Handbook (PHb), and Dungeon Master's Guide (DMG), as the base rules for playing EPT is based on those handbooks.

# Part One: The World of Tékumel

About Tékumel

Tékumel and its related products are copyright © 1975 and 2010

Tékumel is a fantasy world with a history stretching back 60,000 years and more. Tékumel is based on the mythologies of India, the Middle East, and Mezo-America. It features large political empires that have existed for millennia, similar to Ancient Rome or China, numerous non-human races, horrific creatures, active god's, powerful magic, intrigue inside of intrigue, rigid social strata, and ancient advanced technology.

It is inhabited by humans of South Asian, Mesoamerican and Middle Eastern descent, plus a large variety of nonhuman intelligent lifeforms. The published game EMPIRE OF THE PETAL THRONE (EPT) assumes that Tékumel is a lost colony of starfaring mankind; this may or may not be true in this campaign. In any case, the inhabitants aren't aware of the "lost colony" theory.

The Five Empires, huge, tradition-bound empires with medieval levels of technology vie for control using magic, large standing armies, and ancient technological devices, occupy a large portion of the northern continent. These five human empires (Livyánu, Mu′ugalavyá, Salarvyá, Tsolyánu, Yán Kór), along with various non-human allies (Ahoggyá, Chíma, Hegléth, Hláka, Hlutrgú, Ninín, Páchi Léi, Pé Chói, Shén, Tinalíya) who are descended from other star faring races, vie to control resources, including other planar "magical powers" and ancient technology, as they vie for survival and supremacy among themselves as well as hostile and other non-human races (Hokún, Mihálli, Nyaggá, Urunén, Vléshga).

### Levels Of Gameplay

Professor Barker listed a number of levels of gameplay. Not to confuse these with D&D levels, we will call them **campaign levels** which can be used within each framework- as follows;

D&D play types- **Gritty Realism**, **Heroic**, **Fantasy** and all these play styles can exist from 1-20 D&D levels depending on player-referee discussion.

EPT play types-(similar and interchangeable to the above D&D )

**Basic Campaign** - adventure in dungeons and tube ways from level 1-20 which may end with retired characters taking over a fief or some reward in the Empire. Character examples...Abmi Tsinel, and The "Baron" from D&D. Also Professor Barkers first book setting.

**Intermediate Campaign**- similar to D&D 1-20 and Epic adventures in the planes, society, etc. May end with players as lords and ladies, retired wizards, etc. all of our high level EPT has to date been in this category. Even surprise backgrounds (you are a secret princess!) fit in this category. Examples... Abmi Tsinel as Archmage, the Baron, Erdu and Hlucha hiTlakotani. (Last is my character) this would be Professor Barkers third book setting.

**Advanced Campaign**- never been done, though Professor Barkers own groups touched on elements of this. Again, can be levels 1-20. Includes elements of interspatial geometry, philosophy and logic. This can be played from level 1-20 as it involves children of unusual talented (alien? "changed"?) parents. It starts as a background choice and slowly develops. Examples - mostly NPCs such as magical "Marek" bodyguards. One player got a wife from the far past in Barkers game. Another was the son of the Undying Wizard Hagarr. Elements of Professor Barkers second and fourth setting revolved around mundane mortals struggling for artifacts. (Artifact in D&D had nothing on these things)

Bill Hartley had spoken with the professor and made notes for decades. Any of the above- or all- are possible, as we can tie them to various levels and success (nothing gets you fame better than some success, and fame attracts - others...)---- any preferences?

In his own words, here is the Professor;

"I thus put "**Empire of the Petal Throne**" out as "**Introductory Tékumel**." It deals with the contemporary situation, particularly in Tsolyánu.

"**Intermediate Tékumel**" might include localised planetary developments, such as the Undying Wizards, the College, and some of the "nearer" Planes Beyond.

"**Advanced Tékumel**" then could go on to treat the Further Planes, the struggles between the Gods (and certain of the Pariah Deities), the denizens of the Pylons, the stratagems and grand planning of forces on several sides, etc. etc. There could even be a "Post-Graduate Tékumel," but..."

### Notes on Tékumel

#### The Climate is Hot

Tékumel is a hot planet that is larger than earth. At the equator, the temperature gets up to 60°C. Temperatures in the northern regions where most human empires flourish are similar to Earth's equatorial zone. Daytime temperatures in the summer can reach 125°F/52°C; nighttime temperatures in the winter go as low as 70°F/21°C. Public nudity is common.

Heat and humidity are a fact of life on Tékumel. Humans can survive in 54°C weather as long as the air is dry and they have enough water. However, 30°C with 100% humidity is lethal. Working, wearing armour or a lot of clothing lowers the lethal temperature.

Every hour in the sun requires 1 liter of water. And anyone wearing armour need to make Constitution saves or suffer a level of exhaustion. (daily for medium armour; hourly for heavy armour)

The Tsolyáni have adjusted by becoming almost nocturnal during the hot months, with long siestas in the day.

#### Common Animals

**Chlén**: A six-legged horned reptile used as a beast of burden, similar to a six-legged triceratops. Its fibrous skin is used to make armour and weapons.

**Hmá**: Llama-like herd animal.

**Hmélu**: Small Hmá.

**Cats (**Tiuni) and **Dogs** were imported to Tékumel and survived the Time of Darkness with Man.

#### Evolution in Action

Because of the heat, insectoids, reptiles, amphibians, and other ‘cold-blooded’ creatures have prospered, and displaced many of ‘warm-blooded’ creatures. Yan Kor, Ghaton, and other northern areas commonly have Tiuni (Cats) as pets and for pest control. While the small dog sized insectoid Qigekh is both competitor and dangerous pray that the Tiuni cannot handle. The Qigekh are often tolerated as the ugly, spiked insect eats other vermin.

#### Not Much Iron

The density of the planet is relatively low, making heavier metals, especially iron, in short supply. Humans have adapted to this with the use of chlén hide, an animal hide chemically treated by the armorer's clan to form a lightweight substance with the hardness of bronze.

#### Radiation

Radiation sickness sometimes results from exposure to artifacts left over from Tékumel’s distant past. Naturally the cause is not understood by modern scholars, who ascribe it to baneful demonic influences. It is possible that the death of Gámulu, first of the Fisherman Kings, resulted from radiation sickness after his banquet in the ruins of Ssuganár. Or perhaps it is only that such is the reward given by the gods for hubris.

#### Tsolyáni Construction

Masonry with mud-brick facing. A common clan or tribe home has two storeys around a central courtyard which contains a well and a garden. The lower floor comprises workrooms and storage rooms, with sleeping and living quarters above. Across the square from the only entrance (a set of double doors) are kitchens, communal washing facilities and latrines opening into a sewer beneath, and a large communal eating/meeting hall.

#### No Cavalry

No riding beasts are known on Tékumel and the only draft animal is the gigantic and ponderously slow chlén, a beast similar to a domesticated triceratops. Most merchant caravans use slave bearers, trained to carry large loads on their backs. Armies have no cavalry, relying on foot soldiers and magic.

#### No Mounts or Vehicles

Tékumel has the wheel, but they don't have a decent draft animal. Horses don't exist, and _Hmelu_ and _Chlen_ move about as fast as a hippo, so although carts are common they are of limited use. Carried litters are very common, but rickshaws haven't been figured out. And remember, if someone decided to introduce such a thing, that the various litter-bearing, litter-building, and transportation clans would strive very hard to prevent the success of the venture. They have their livelihoods to maintain, and no they're not interested in any newfangled ideas, thank you.

#### Magic Exists

The veil between universes is thin, allowing the power of the mind to unleash the energies from between the planes. The training in the magical arts is mostly controlled by the temples.

#### Nonhumans

Several species of nonhumans live on Tékumel, including the insectoid Pé Chói, the reptilian Shén, the arboreal Páchi Léi, the amphibious Hlútrgu, the aquatic Swamp Folk, the diminutive Tinalíya and Pygmy Folk, the mysterious Shunned Ones, as well as the native Ssú and Hlǘss.

The insectoid Pé Chói and the asexual Páchi Léi live in the western forests of Tsolyánu, the reptilian Shén live south of Livyánu, the tiny Tinalíya live in northern Livyánu, the water-loving Swamp Folk live in southern Mu'ugalavyá, the barrel-shaped Ahoggyá live in the swamps of Salarvyá, the flying Hláka live in the mountains to the east of Tsolyánu, and the diminutive Pygmy Folk live in northern Yán Kór.

#### The Gods Exist

Over the millennia, contact has been made with powerful interdimensional beings, who have been worshipped as Gods. The pantheon consists of the Five Stability Gods and their Cohorts and the Five Change Gods and their Cohorts. The Cohorts are slightly less powerful than their God counterpart, acting as assistant gods. Other gods exist in other areas.

The great majority of the population is illiterate, superstitious and very conservative in many aspects.

#### Clan is Everything

The clans are the major unit of social organization in Tékumel of which nearly all citizens are a part. Clans are large extended family groups, organized by status and sometimes by trade or religion. To be without a clan is to be lower than a member of the lowest latrine-cleaning clan.

#### Women

There are two types of women, the Clan woman and the Aridáni. The Clan woman is the foundation of clan life and is greatly revered. She cooks and cares. Clan women do not engage in trade, they are not liable any debts they incur. Their safety is the responsibility of the clan.

Women can choose to be a ‘good clan girl’ and let their clan take care of them in all things (including choosing a suitable husband) or they may go a government office and declare themselves 'Aridáni', the legal equivalent of a male.

Women are born into their families and clans without the same rights and privileges as men. They are considered "Second-class Citizens" that can be married off for political gain and cannot take employment outside of their clan. If a woman wishes to have the full rights and responsibilities of men, all she must do is declare themselves 'Aridáni'.

To become Aridani is not difficult, except that maybe your clan might have other plans for you (marry you off to some land-baron or something). Barring unusual circumstances, you simply visit your local office of the Imperium (located near the governor's mansion or an office of the Omnipotent Azure Legion [the Tsolyáni Imperial police]) and declare yourself Aridani. It's recorded in the Imperial records, and you can go home and tell your clanmaster that the local land-baron can go take a flying leap. On the other hand if they lock you in your room BEFORE you can declare Aridani status, you're socially considered 'their property' and certainly the marriage is for your own good.

And of course, everything is greased by gold. Say you declare your status with two witnesses and it's recorded on the register. But you're Golden Bough Clan and the reason you're declaring Aridani is because then, instead of becoming the fourth wife of the Governor of Sokatis, you can marry that cute boy of the Rampant Chlen clan who peels the hides off the chlen and has such big muscles. By nightfall your two witnesses have been accidentally killed by inadvertent sword-thrusts to the gut, your records of status are nowhere to be found, your cute fiancé has been trampled by a chlen in the compound, and your clan is several thousand Kaitars poorer than the day before. And you're not Aridani and you are on a litter bound for Sokatis, with "bound" having multiple meanings in this case.

All female PCs are Aridáni.

#### Sex & Marriage

In general, Tékumel is sex-positive. Sexual fidelity is not part of the marriage contract. Homosexuality and bisexuality are accepted. Polygyny and polyandry are both practiced. Some regions and countries are more conservative about these topics.

#### Ethics

Ethics in Tsolyánu comes down to knowing one's place in society and 'noble' and 'ignoble' actions informed by that knowledge. This is best explained by an excerpt from The Book of Ebon Bindings, a Tsolyáni manual about dealings with demons:

_When a man acts 'nobly,' he behaves in accordance with his Skein of Destiny, as he perceives it. He serves his God; he is loyal to those who think as he does; he is staunch in his courage; and he is forthright in his deeds._

_Conversely, a man acts 'ignobly' when he ignores his own avowed principles, when he abandons his clan or his comrades, when he vacillates or is false or lazy, and when his deeds are small and niggling. The priestess of Lady Avánthe is 'noble' when she feeds the poor, assuages the pain of the aged and the sick, and supports the strictures of society. So also is the priest of Lord Vimúhla 'noble' when he goes forth to bloody battle, sacrifices the daily victims upon the altar of the Flame, and burns the cities of his enemies. The same is true of the devotee of Lord Sárku when he establishes the cities of the dead (the great graveyards and catacombs outside of most Tsolyáni cities), gives his offerings to the mouths of the Questing Worm, and strives ever to draw the living down into the eternal watchfulness of Death._

It is “noble” for someone to practice what they preach, to follow their principles, and behave with openness and dignity. While it is “ignoble” to vacillate, procrastinate, lie, act hypocritically, be lazy, or pretend one thing while doing another.

#### The Underworld

Ditlána is an ancient practice where every 500 to 1000 years, cities are systematically demolished and rebuilt.

This leaves cities sitting on a mound of the basements and sub-basements of the clan houses, temples, and other buildings. The oldest shrines of the temples are down in the layers, and the priests dig back down to reconnect with these shrines. Thus some underworlds of Tékumel are beneath the cities.

#### Barbarians and Outsiders

Tribal peoples, such as the N'lüss and the natives of M'mórcha, and many nonhumans, like the Ahoggyá, and essentially anyone from outside the Five Empires are considered as "Outsiders/Barbarians". Citizens of the Five Empires may not always like each other, but they recognize their common inheritance from the ancient empire of Engsván hla Gánga and outsiders are always seen as inferior for that reason.

#### Slaves

_"Slavery is a human invention and not found in nature. Indeed, it was that other human invention, war, which provided the bulk of slaves, but they were also the bounty of piracy ... or the product of breeding."_ — Gaius huNic of Fields

Slaves and slavery are common in the five empires, and they play an important role in society and the economy of each empire. Besides manual labor, slaves performed many domestic services, and might be employed at highly skilled jobs and professions. Unskilled slaves, or those sentenced to slavery as punishment, worked on farms, in mines, and at mills.

People find themselves enslaved by a number of ways, by losing face with their clans, debtors and indigents, minor criminals, or caught by slavers, such as miscellaneous foreigners, and some non-humans.

Slaves are considered "Valuable Property" by their owners and under the law, however they had no legal personhood. They do have certain rights and expectations within the empire, such as the right to file complaints against their masters. However, the testimony of a slave cannot be accepted in a court of law unless the slave is tortured — a practice based on the belief that slaves in a position to be privy to their masters' affairs would be too virtuously loyal to reveal damaging evidence unless coerced.

Slaves can hold property which, despite the fact that it belonged to their masters, they were allowed to use as if it were their own. There is a stronger social obligation to care for slaves born within a household or on a family farm or agricultural estate, and at times they would have been the children of freed slaves of the household.

Skilled or educated slaves were allowed to earn their own money, and might hope to save enough to buy their freedom. Such slaves were often freed by the terms of their master's will, or for services rendered, and freed slaves could become citizens and members of the clan they once served (but not high clans). Any future children of a freedman would be born free, with full rights of citizenship.

# The Five Empires

## Tsolyánu: The Empire of the Petal Throne

The government of the Empire is a form of authoritarian bureaucracy. The power of the Emperor is absolute, served by the ever-vigilant eyes of the Omnipotent Azure Legion and its agents. As soon as a monarch dies all the royal heirs are summoned to Béy Sü for the Kólumejálim, the ‘Choosing of the Emperors’. There they undergo a traditional roster of tests designed to cover every facet of character thought to be needful for a ruler. The strongest contenders are taken at last within the sacred precincts of the Temple of Hnálla where the final selection is made according to ancient and secret ritual methods. Once an heir is chosen to ascend to the Petal Throne (reputedly a great seat of gray-green carved from a single block of translucent jade in the semblance of a delicate flower), he or she is immured in the Golden Tower at Avanthár for the rest of his or her life, unseen and unheard, but with the weight of divine authority behind every edict.

The state that is perhaps the closest to Livyánu in terms of bureaucratic elaboration is the Empire of the Petal Throne. This largest of states is governed by the Tlakotáni family, a dynasty that has held absolute power in the great basin between the Chákan and Ranállan Highlands, between the Thendráya Massif and the Deeps of Chanayága, for 2350 years. Each Tlakotáni emperor rules in total seclusion from within the Fortress of Avanthár, and is considered a god by his people.

Other nations view the Tsolyáni as try-hards.

Tsolyánu is an autocracy, in which the Emperor never leaves the great city of Avanthar in which he is attended by his retainers, the Omnipotent Azure Legion. The Emperor owns everything and everyone in the Empire, and technically can tell anyone to throw themselves into the fire at any time. In practice, of course, as Tsolyánu is a vast land of fifty million souls, the Emperor exercises power through a vast bureaucracy of bureaus, temples and military districts, though all derive their power through him. The government is an authoritarian bureaucracy of ancient cruelty.

The Empire’s most impressive feature is its network of Sákbe roads, each a Great Wall of China in itself. These raised stone highways stand 8-10m high and 20-25m across. They are studded with guard towers, and fortified at the Empire’s borders. The Sákbe roads contain three stepped pathways: the highest and narrowest for Imperial officials and messengers; the second for troops; the lowest and widest for traders and ordinary folk. No riding beasts exist, so all travel is done on foot, or on one of the creaky, slow-moving carts pulled by domesticated Chlén-beasts. Trade is conducted by caravans of bearers.

The Tsolyáni are devoted to formal rule and ritual. Tsolyáni males average 1.68m in height, and are generally of slender-wiry or medium builds. Complexions range from coppery brown to a golden tan; noses are aquiline or straight; hair is fine and straight, always a glossy black; and there is relatively little body hair. Muscular, square-jawed and hawk-featured is the Tsolyáni male preference. Women are 1.57m in height on average with rather voluptuous figures; the common standard of female beauty is Tanulé, one of the Aspects of Avánthe, who is depicted as a slim girl with long black hair, triangular and piquant features, a retrousse nose and wide cheekbones. Curly or brown-streaked hair is considered unbeautiful, and light-coloured eyes are thought to be a sign of dishonesty.

Tsolyáni have a predilection for elaborate ceremonial, visual display, and the security brought about by knowing exactly where one stands in the social order. When two Tsolyáni meet, it is usually obvious which is of higher

status, and therefore to be deferred to.

Tsolyáni prize "noble action" above all else, which means keeping your place, knowing your role, and performing as a hero of the ancient epics would have done.

As people rise in Circles of power and influence within Tsolyánu, more situations happen where a citizen must fulfill several different obligations and the tension between them. In the early life, when everyone is still learning their place in Tsolyani, there won't be much of that, but once everyone has a clan AND a temple AND a military superior AND political allies to please, then the constriction start becoming stressful.

![[tsolyanu1.webp]]

The other four Empires join in describing the Tsolyáni as arrogant, officious, and overrefined, a nation always striving to live up to the unattainable standard of its Engsvanyáli ancestors.

## Tsolyani Political Parties

### The Imperial Party

The Imperial Party is centred at Avanthár under the leadership of the High Provost of the Omnipotent Azure Legion, Lord Qorumá hiRi'inyússa. It is comprised of the most influential courtiers, palace officials, and Tlakotáne in the empire. Its lords and ladies are the most committed to continuing the traditions and continuity of the Seal Emperor of Tsolyánu. The Petal Throne is its emblem and spiritual heart.

Currently, the party seeks to keep Hirkáne Tlakotáne alive as long as possible, so as to ensure a smooth succession. The next priority is to prevent any sort of alliance between two or more of the neighbouring states. A last priority is to strengthen the central authority of the empire, while also keeping it secular and neutral in the struggle between the Tlomítlanyal (centred in the south) and the Tlokiriqáluyal (centred in a band of cities further north).

The Imperial Party is willing to work at times with the Priestly Party but finds the royalists to threatening and the Military Party to dangerous.

### The Military Party

The Military Party is split because of the growing strength of temple-funded legions.

The militarists believe they can join with the Imperial Party. “Let the sycophants sing the glories of the Emperor before the Petal Throne; leave the glory of the Imperium to us!” (Kérdu Kéttukal). A way of life could be worked out with the Royalists, but differences with the conservative within the Priestly Party have stopped any negotiations.

### The Priestly Party

The bloc is split between the devotees of Stability and Change, but cooperation has come about at times when common goals are meet: the expansion of the temples’ power and establishment of theocratic control over the Empire. The Priestly Party has immense power: the temples fun some of the Empire's best legions; a communications network of telepathic relays which rivals that of the Omnipotent Azure Legion; own vast lands, collect tithes, and receive donations of the pious.

The majority of the leadership prefer the status quo and at most cautious expansion. They get along well with the Imperial Party. Land rivalries put them at odds with the Royalist Party, and their conservative nature make them fear the aggressive stance of the Military Party.

The Priestly Party is distrusted, however, as religions are international and priests collaborate with priests of other nations. In addition, temples are wary of one another since alliances with different nations aid different temples and add to a temples followers.

### The Royalist Party

The Royalist Party is so-named because its people are descended from the ancient royal families of the Bednálljans and the Mridleneláni. This is their claim, anyway. In reality, these are the noble clans and families that ruled Tsolyánu’s over twenty-odd separate kingdoms during the Time of No Kings interregnum. This bloc is held together by the skill of Lord Khámiyal hiSayúncha, Governor of Béy Sý (still Tsolyánu’s largest city). This bloc of families and clans seeks to replace the Tlakotáne with their own dynasties. They also seek a decentralisation of the state, more power-sharing, and eventually a political revolution resulting in a system similar to that existing in feudal Salarvyá. This party doesn’t see Mu'ugalavyá as a threat, doesn’t really want to give any more land over to the temples, but does, for now, want to prevent war and disruption.

## Secret Societies

### Copper Tomb

### Incandescent Blaze Society

### Inner Sphere

### Ndalu Clan

### Refulgent Blue Curtain Society

### Society of Blue Light

## Cities of Tsolyánu

### Avanthár

Avanthár, the Seat of the God-King, the Fortress of the Flowering, is a vast natural fortification cut from the heart of a small mountain. Deep in its center there stands “The Petal Throne”, a beautiful seat of jade shaped like an exquisite half-opened _tetél_ flower. Legend swirls around The Petal Throne: it was the supreme creation of the Kingdom of the Gods; it caused the downfall of the Golden Age; it closed over and swallowed up the emperor Tóntiken Rirúne, who was said to have made pacts with demons. These legends don’t even approach the truth.

The Petal Throne is _god_.

### Béy Sý

Béy Sý, the Soul of the World, the World Mountain of Mutual Harmony, was built by the fourth Mridrenèláni emperor Ssirandár I. This famous ruler situated his new capital on the confluence of four rivers, the two greatest being the Mssúma and the Arjáshtra. The Kingdom of the Gods was ruled from this place for over five thousand years, the longest running single political entity (except possibly for the government of Livyánu) on the continent. Béy Sý remains an important imperial administrative center, even though the far northern mountain fortress of Avanthár is the current capital.

### Béy Trántis

Béy Trántis, the City of Victory, the City of Perfect Symmetry, was designed by the Mridlenèláni Archon Ssesmúga IV. This famous scholar employed scientific and cultural knowledge to make a brilliant city. Being a lover of mathematics and science, Ssesmúga IV sought advice from wizards and wise men, who built the city following the principles of _nraméskh_. The city is divided into ten blocks, out of which two consist of temples, state buildings and palaces and the remaining eight are allotted to the public. In order to ensure security, huge fortifications were built, pierced by seven strong gates.

### Butrús

Butrús is located deep in the Gilráya Forest, high in the hills of Pán Cháka. Its major egress lies south along the Podhhár River to the Deeps of Chanayága, rather than east toward Úrmish or west toward the Mu’ugalavyáni frontier. Called the Gem of the Gilráya, Butrús is a pretty little city making artistic use of woods as much as stone. The city is coveted by the Mu’ugalavyáni, partially because it was indeed a part of that nation in the past.

### Chéne Hó

Chéne Hó, the Middle City, the City of the Friends of Man, lies amid the hills of Dó Cháka and so also close to the enclaves of the non-human Pé Chói. Because of this, Chéne Hó is a center of scholarship and of the ancient crafts of embroidery, gold embroidery, the weaving of Gýdru-cloth, and engraving, carving, and painting on wood. The city is informally semi-autonomous, the nearby human population speaking a pigeon of Mu’ugalavyáni and Tsolyáni, and is claimed by both of those two powerful empires.

### Fasíltum

Fasíltum, the City of the Chiming Skulls, the Heart of Flame, stands proudly upon a southward thrusting arm of the Thendráya Massif. Ruled for over ten millennia by the haughty Vríddi Family (who have occupied the thrones of half a dozen empires), Fasíltum is constantly plotting to overthrow the emperor, to strike out with Tumíssa to create a Fire Kingdom, or to ignite a holy war to convert the world to the worship of Vimúhla. Fanatic in their devotion to the god of Fire, the city’s inhabitants are dangerous foes (and perhaps even more dangerous friends).

Several of the Vríddi’s finest are in prison.

### Jáikalor

Jáikalor, the Queen of Arámkom Bay, Gateway to the World, is a typical small to mid-sized Tsolyáni port city, built a little distance from the east bank of the Ranánga River (to give it room for Ditlána). Currently the city is rebuilding its defenses to guard against the ambitious Salarvyáni. The Burújikh hiHitláshikh, the Tower of Victory, is a notable landmark, raised to commemorate victory over the Engsvanyáli during the reign of the First Tlakotáni.

### Jakálla

Jakálla, the Mistress of the Mssúma River, City Half as Old as the World, is unique in that it is built upon a series of natural and man-made islands in the Gulf of Porudáya (much like Venice on Earth). There are also two bankside adjuncts to the city, Pála Jakálla on the north bank and Músa Jakálla on the south bank. This means that Ditlána is done differently here; there is no gradual build-up of elevation and no extensive underworld. There is, as elsewhere, a City of the Dead south and east of the city on the Eqónuyel Heights and this certainly has an underworld.

### Katalál

Katalál, the City of the Battle of Falling Hills, is a small city (actually a very large town) that is the capital of Ketvíru Province. Like most of the bustling cities of the Bednállja Plain it is flat, neat, stolid and a little pompous - devoted to the agricultural bounty of the region, and to the making of money. Its major exports include forestry products, timber, hides, and Chlén-hide weapons and tools.

### Khirgár

Khirgár, the City of Aromatics, Home of the Anointed Ones, is famous for having an Hlýss city underneath the surface of the earth to the northeast. In fact, the city’s wealth in part derives from gold scavenged from the mounds of slag that dot the plain overlying this settlement. It also means that dnélu and nenyélu trouble the area at night. Its people anoint themselves with aromatic herbs to ward off the attentions of these creatures.

### Méku

Méku, the City Beautiful, stands at the confluence of the Chaigávra and Umétla rivers. It is part of the highlands belt of cities that staunchly hangs onto the worship of the Tlokiriqáluyal. Its Governor retains his traditional title, The Disposer of Méku, and its religious life traditionally revolves around the Temple of Vimúhla, God of Fire and Destruction. Méku withstood the waves of barbarians who broke upon its walls in the invasions of the second millennium, and today it is a staging area for punitive raids into Mu’ugalavyá.

### Mrelú

Mrelú, the City of Roads, lies not only beside the important Chaigávra River, but also the roads leading east and west between Tsolyánu and Mu’ugalavyá. Across the river and southwest of the city lies the scenic Férghanu Valley which bisects the hills of Dó Cháka and leads to Chéne Hó and thence to Malcháiran. Because the city guards the entry to the Férghanu and the fords across the Chaigávra, Mrélu has seen plenty of warfare. Scholars have found evidence of eight separate cities in the ground on which Mrélu now stands.

### Paránta

Paránta, the City of Processions, the City of Joy, is a place known for fusing Salarvyáni culture with Tsolyáni culture during the Time of No Kings. It is also associated with Engsvanyálu, and was considered to be the second city of that maritime league thousands of years ago. When after the Fall of Kolméktio Mridlenél sorcerer-kings oppressed the people, a phenomenon known as the Muthubá Movement appeared in Paránta to protect the peasants and overthrow violent despots. The legendary hero Hagárr of Paránta led this movement for a time, casting down several dark tyrants.

### Púrdimal

Púrdimal, the Black Toad of the Empire, the City of the Cradle, is a place founded by refugees fleeing the destruction of Purdaním when the Demon Prince Kurritlakál devastated that ancient city over three thousand years ago. Built on high ground within the wetlands called The Cradle of the Twins (in legend, Ksárul and Dlamélish were twin deities and eventual lovers), the city’s reputation for eerie and eldritch phenomena has grown and grown.

### Purdaním (New)

New Purdaním, the City of Rebirth, the Bastion Against Evil, is a city founded by the Tsolyáni emperor Hejjéka IV, “The Restorer of Dignities”. It is populated by returning families whose ancestors lived in Old Purdaním, but also by colonists from all over the Second Imperium. The haunted ruins of Old Purdaním have been off-limits for nine centuries, but in recent years have been opened up to cautious exploration and plunder.

### Penóm

Penóm, the City of Beautiful Bridges, is a city known for having miles-long wooden bridges crossing the Kshétra Estuary. Archeological evidence proves that Penóm is the furthest east that any outpost of the Empire of Llyán of Tsámra was established. Apparently they knew it by any of a number of names: Malri-mulrep, Krokolaz, and Delob. Long just a fishing village, Penóm has grown into a small city over the last millennia.

### Sokátis

Sokátis, the City of Roofs, the City of Myriad Loggia, is an interesting place where one can walk for hours and never emerge from under an arcade. In many respects, Sokátis is more typical of a Salarvyáni city; carven gargoyles, ornate parapets, intricate bas-reliefs and heavily decorated walls slope up to the ponderous vaults and domes of its roofs.

### Sárku

Sárku, the City of Death, Eternal Splendour, squats like a carrion beetle upon five hills running down the middle of Mzhu’úm Valley. This place is as close as Tsolyánu gets to having a “forbidden city”. No one goes there. No one, even other worshipers of the Tlokiriqáluyal, welcomes anyone coming from there. The faint scent of _undeath_ hangs about everything and everyone having to do with the City of Sárku. High in the mountains, just west of the sky needle of Thénu Thendráya Peak, this city belonging to the Master of Decay goes its own way.

### Thráya

Thráya, the City of the Trumpet Flower, the City of The Magic Stroke; this city is known in legend for having been created by sorcery some 10,000 years ago. Later, when Queen Nayári of the Silken Thighs wanted to shift her headquarters to face a threat of invasion over what are today known as the Oqréjja Mountains, she moved to Thráya. The ruins of her palace can still be seen by looking south from atop the Bridge of the Sun or east from the battlements of the Fortress of the High Lord.

### Tumíssa

Tumíssa, the City of the Crag, the City of the High Redoubt, is built inside the Átkolel caldera and is surrounded by a series of lakes that act as a vast moat. Considered impregnable, the volcano that serves as its base is part of the Chayéngar Range and the Umétla River flows from Lake Párunal to feed its lakes. To the east across these lakes lies Súba Valley, and beyond, rising rank on rank, rises the Thendráya Massif. Tumíssa is another of Tsolyanu’s cities that remains steeped in the worship of the Masters of the Shadow; as in Méku, the fire god Vimúhla holds power here.

### Úrmish

Úrmish, according the mythological legend, was founded by the god, Chiú Knésh (an aspect of Wurú, said to have been born there), and so the place is called the City of the Sentinel, and the Blue Stone Bulwark. This mention of colour derives from the lovely, if dour, dark blue basalt with which the entire city is built. Politically, Úrmish has been ruled by Llyáni exiles, pre-Bednálljan pirates, Gilráyan monks, Chákan warlords, the Empire of the Gods, and now Tsolyánu. It has retained traces of all these to this very day.

## Livyánu

Livyánu, the mysterious land of sorcery, lies across the sea to the southwest of Tsolyánu.

The society of Livyánu is completely dominated by the priesthoods of their Shadow Gods—civil, military and religious affairs are handled by functionaries detached from temple service. The details of their system are not revealed to outsiders, and many Circle memberships are deliberately concealed. As far as is known, the highest official is one ásqar Gyardánaz, ‘Principal Staff of the Glory of Qame’él’, who presides over the central Council of the Priesthoods.

The state with by far the greatest continuity going back in time is Livyánu. This completely totalitarian theocratic state has existed since before the First Imperium (10,000 years old). The people of Livyánu are thoroughly dedicated to their shadow gods, and all social structures are connected in some way to the great temples of these mysterious divinities. There are no clans, in the Tsolyáni or Mu’ugalavyáni sense of the term. Instead, there are Septs. Septs divide (based on aptitude and achievement rather than blood) the laity connected to a particular Temple into hierarchic and functional groups.

Other nations look upon this with disgust and with horror.

The Livyáni are tall and graceful: men average 1.70m inheight and women 1.63m. They are often of a boyishly slender build, dolichocephalic, with straight or retrousse noses, wavy black or dark brown hair, a golden copper complexion, and little body hair. Livyáni females are frequently high-breasted and narrow-hipped, and tend to remain in seclusion, only emerging masked in curious disguises representing beasts, demons and gods. Both men and women tattoo their faces with intricately tiny designs taken from their mythology.

Theocratic Livyánu has the most divergent pantheon in all of the Five Empires. Their Shadow Gods are kept shrouded in mystery, their attributes often deliberately misrepresented to foreigners, and their hierachies are only distantly polite to the priesthoods of other lands. It is certain however that interplanetary magic and the summoning of ‘Demons’ make up a large part of their rituals.

The Tsolyáni stereotype of them is of sophisticated, devious, smugly pious poseurs, aloof and full of airy conceits. The Livyáni religious secrecy doubtless reinforces this reputation. They are also considered law-abiding and cultured however.

1. Livyánu are secretive, tattooed, cultured, and inscrutable.
2. Livyánu worship their own secret pantheon, the Shadow Gods.
3. Livyánu train the best human magicians.
4. Livyánu are tall and graceful.
5. Ruled by magic and secret cults
6. No direct border with Tsolyánu, though ocean trade is common

## Mu’ugalavyá

To the west the Empire of Mu’ugalavyá stands as Tsolyánu’s greatest rival.

Mu’ugalavyá is ruled by four ‘Palaces’, each of which governs all aspects of life within a specified geographical area, or ‘Province’. The central government is an oligarchy based in Ssa’átis formed of the four ‘Princes’ (Dü’ümünish), representatives of the priesthoods, and certain senior clan-heads. Each of the Princes is in command of the Legions raised and posted in his region. The red-lacquered troops of the Four Palaces of the Square, as the government is called, stand guard upon their borders facing the blue-clad Tsolyáni legions on the summit of the opposing Sákbe Road, hoping to one day regain the lost Cháka Protectorates.

The Mu’ugalavyáni are 1.5-2cm shorter than Tsolyáni norms and more brachiocephalic; with rather flattened hook noses, wide features, and coarse, straight black hair. Their eyes are sometimes grey, and their colouration is lighter.

The religion of Mu’ugalavyá is similar to that of Tsolyánu, though Vimúhla is prevalent amongst the Gods—his temples are wealthier, and his clergy receive preferences. The noble clans also venerate another divinity: the beast headed Hrsh, whose primary shrine lies on the forbidden island of Mu’ugallá. It is not known whether Hrsh is another great interdimensional being, or an amalgam of Vimúhla, Karakán, and possibly Ksárul.

The Land of the Three Rivers, centred on the Mu’ugállu, the Putuhénu, and the Rukkúnket watersheds, is nearly the equal of Tsolyánu, but is governed by a charismatic emperor whose public cult maximizes devotion to the state. The current emperor has initiated a religious revolution, introducing the syncretic god Hŕsh as the primary temple in the land. He has also opened up relations of Livyánu, and some people suspect that the dramatic changes in spiritual life have had to do with this rapprochement.

Mu’ugalavyá has existed for only three centuries, when the northerners of what is today Yán Kór flooded south through The Chelnú Gap and forced the city-states previously existing along its three famous waterways to unite in order to face the invasions.

The Tsolyáni see the current emperor and his religious revolution as a threat, and have launched a series of military campaigns designed to topple him.

The Tsolyáni see them as humourless blockheads, hopelessly stolid and unimaginative, set in their bureaucratic ways. However they are also known to be stiffly correct, honest, and ‘noble’.

Mu'ugalavyani invaded the forest state of Do Chaka in 2365, using an army of the Ssu, loathsome monsters who detest all mankind, as their icebreakers to shatter the army of Prince Eselne and sack the city of Tumissa in Tsolyánu. The plan, led by a general named Tewfik, failed when a group of Tsolyáni agents stole the Eye of Commanding Enemies, a magic item which kept the Ssu hypnotised. When the Ssu awoke from their trance, they turned on the Mu'ugalavyani, rending the army to the four winds.

1. Mu’ugalavyá are a centralised, bureaucratic oligarchy [a small group of people having control of a country, organization, or institution.]
2. Mu’ugalavyá favour the worship of Lord Vimúhla and their own god, Lord Hrsh.
3. Mu’ugalavyá covet the western Tsolyáni protectorates of Do Chaka and Pan Chaka.
4. Mu’ugalavyá are highly militaristic and make good soldiers.
5. Mu’ugalavyá: a little over a decade ago, the Mu’ugalavyáni fought the Tsolyáni in a vicious little border war. The Tsolyáni Empire won easily and conquered most of the border forest areas.

#### Cities of Mu’ugalavyá

##### Edlún

Edlún, The City of Temples, stands between the Tlashté Heights and the Nráksùra Plateau, and was the capital of the Kingdom of God during the Time of No Kings. Instead of having several huge temples with shrines to their gods’ aspects contained inside, Edlún has individual separate shrines – spread out and all mixed together – situated throughout the city. There are three hundred and fifty-five of these, most dedicated to the aspects of Karkánish, Kigársh, Awédha and Di’íla, but also to the aspects of others of the Tlomítlanyal and now to Lord Hŕsh.

##### Heméktu

Heméktu, The Magicians’ Phylactery, was originally a colony of Livyánu (founded some 7000 years ago). This center of thaumaturgy boasts an enormous library and a famous observatory. Its College of the Priesthoods accepts students of all faiths, no matter their nationality or their religion. There is a certain air of mystery about this city, almost as if influenced by Livyánu to this day. The Temple of Hŕsh has had more converts here, proportionately, than anywhere else in Mu’ugalavyá.

##### Hŕsh Fortress

Hŕsh Fortress, Glory of Lord Hŕsh, is a vast fortification crowning Mi’íhir Hill in the west-central Chákas. It is located an equal distance from Chéne Hó, Katalál, Úrmish, and Sru’ú. Emperor Tu'úmnish Ssa'amýssa spends his summers here, as the elevation and dry air is more comfortable than the humid basin where the Mu’ugállu, the Rukkúnket, and the Putuhénu rivers meet. Recently, a vast walled hunting preserve has begun to be constructed to the east of the fort.

##### Kheíris

Kheíris, prior to the creation of Mu’ugalavyá, came under the control of successive dynasties; the flooding of the Mu’ugállu River has been critical in attracting the ambitions of various claimants, for it ensures the fertility of the soil in the region. Now the most populous city of the empire of Mu’ugalavyá, Kheíris is called The Mother of the World, The Well-Guarded, and The Thousand Towers. It exports grain to as far away as Mélek Táru and Chame’él.

##### Sru’ú

Sru’ú, The Overwatcher, is so named because it serves as a watchpost over the hill peoples of Pán Cháka and the Gilráya Forest. Currently governed by Lord Kurtóglish Hizír Reís,this adventurer now actively excavates the ruins of Ktélanu, anciently Kutteláino (the home of the legendary wizard Changéla). He hopes to uncover the secret of that ancient city’s destruction, as well as to recover some of the paraphernalia once belonging to that powerful wizard himself.

## Salarvyyá

The fifth of the great empires, Salarvyyá, lies along the long southeastern coast.

Seven great feudal dynasties rule Salarvyyá, their land farmed by lesser clans in a complex system of feifs, feudal duties, and reciprocal responsibilities. Each of the seven families holds one or more monopoly: the Chruggilléshmu family of Tsatsayágga has charge of the sea and shipping along the southern coast and also holds the reins of the central government; the Hrüchcháqsha family of Chamé’el has a monopoly upon the Vrélq, the crustacean which produces the black dye used for clothing and dyeing armour; etc.

Salarvyá is not a unified imperial state at all, but rather a constitutional monarchy whose “King” has more or less only ritual functions. This form of government has been maintained in Salarvyá for 1267 years, and during that millennium the merchant class that brought about the political innovation has made itself ever more and more powerful. Today the merchant fleets of Salarvyá rule the Deeps of Chanayága and colonies have been established as far away as Tsúpil Hláya.

Salarvyá is expansionist and aggressive; it is more dangerous than Mu’ugalavyá, but takes care to hide this fact.

In theory the Salarvyáni hold to the divine right of kings, but in reality his authority is weak, and real power is held by the Council of Nobles, a body composed of senior members of the Chruggilléshmu family, delegations from the other major lineages, a few clergy, and representatives from other vassal clans. The present monarch, King Griggatsétsa, is quite mad, and his duties have been relegated to his clan-cousin, Prince Zhurrilúgga.

The Salarvyáni are quite distinctive: of the same average height as the Tsolyáni, but with more sallow complexions of almost a pale yellowish tan, and they are generally more hirsute, with heavy body hair, curly or even kinky beards and sickle-shaped noses. They tend towards obesity, especially after age 30. The Tsolyáni regard them as feudal hotheads, ‘greasy men with beards like woven rugs’, who have nothing better to do than squabble over trifles.

The Goddess Shiringgáyi dominates all others in Salarvyyá. She is apparently a combination of Avánthe and Dlamélish, and her temples are found all the way from Chame’él out to Mimoré on the eastern ocean. Shrines to Pavár’s other deities are indeed present in every town and city, and there are a few localised divinities as well: eg. Black Qárqa, a particularly repellent form of Sárku venerated by the lords of Tsa’avtúlgu. The priesthoods of Salarvyyá are powerful but perhaps not as all-pervasive and wealthy as those of the other four Empires. Only the Mreshshél-átl family, the hereditary guardian of Shiringgáyi’s sanctuary on the shores of Lake Mrissútl, exhibit a fanaticism equal to that of the inhabitants of the City of Sárku or the Vríddi of Fasíltum.

1. Salarvyáni are feudal states dominated by seven powerful families.
2. Salarvyáni worship their Goddess Shiringgayi above all other Gods.
3. Salarvyáni are hairy, have shallow (almost yellow) skin, and the men have curly beards.
4. The king of Salarvyá “mad king” Griggatsetta, was literally insane (he is dead now).
5. Salarvyáni are renowned exponents of rapier and dagger fighting.
6. The black-bearded Salarvyáni are a treacherous people. A few decades ago, they fought Tsolyánu in a major war and were thrashed. Now, they have little stomach for further defeats, but are always watching for signs of weakness.

## Yán Kór

Yán Kór to the north is a hardy land of forthright, sturdy men—and even stronger women, since matriarchy is the general rule—ruled by the Baron áld, formerly a general of Tsolyánu.

Yán Kór is a unified state in name only. The many Kingdoms which have only recently surrendered their sovereignty to the greater whole still exercise much independence, and the office of the emperor itself is filled as a result of a vote taken by the most powerful nobles in the land. The reigning emperor is a very capable man, and is succeeding in strengthening the central government. He too views the changes in Mu’ugalavyá as a threat.

Before the emergence of the charismatic Baron áld as national leader, Yán Kór was little more than a loosely allied jumble of city-states, clan-matriarchies, and petty principalities. During his short reign the Baron has managed to impose a degree of uniformity; functionaries of the national government are now organised in ‘Circles’, as in Tsolyánu, and all areas now pay their taxes into the coffers of the central government in Yán Kór City.

The Yán Kóryani are 2-2.5cm shorter, on average, than their Tsolyáni neighbours to the south. They are stockier, heavier, and sometimes bow-legged.

The gods of the north are almost identical to those of the Tsolyáni pantheon, although their names and rituals do vary somewhat.

The Tsolyáni characterise the Yán Kóryani as rustic imitations of their southern betters, peripheral upstarts, and crude barbarians—though they do have a reputation for courage and loyalty.

Baron Ald has old grudges against Tsolyánu, specifically the previous Emperor Hirikane and his greatest general, Kettukal hiMraktine. The Yan Koryani army is huge, as most Yan Koryani men are warriors, with women running the economy and skilled trades. They have won a few battles against armies led by the bookish Prince Dhi'chune and the bold, but rash, Prince Mridobu.

1. Yán Kóryani has historically been a matriarchy.
2. Yán Kóryani form the core of a rough alliance of small northern states
3. Yán Kóryani city states are fiercely independent.

# Part Two: Characters of the Empire

Players choose a Culture to play as opposed to a Race: See file [EPT5e - Cultures and Races](http://drive.google.com/open?id=1ExekiEW5lw2657vSAxlOPA0F8s-RxNzm1SGCw8WgfK4)

**Choosing a culture replaces the choice of a character's race in EPT.**

## Creating characters

EMPIRE OF THE PETAL THRONE (EPT) gives players an appropriate introduction to Tsolyánu by stating that all new player-characters (PC’s) are foreigners who have to find their way in a Tsolyáni society.

After which, any player creating a character can make a native Tsolyáni, who are likely from Jakálla or another major city; that it is assumes a certain familiarity with Tsolyáni culture that the player has first played in an EPT Campaign.

Most adventurers are average citizens called upon by their clan, temple, legion, or government to perform some important task. Temple guards, bureaucrats, priests, soldiers, agents of the Empire, and simple clansmen may all be sent on special missions.

Foreigners may also be hired for dangerous tasks as they are expendable.

When creating a character for Tékumel, your character selections show what style of play you want to tell stories about. If you want plenty of battles – play a warrior; if temple intrigue is more your thing, create a political-oriented priest. The character is yours and you’ll hopefully be playing it for a while, so do take the time to personalise her, adding quirks and thinking about her past history as well as her current aims.

## Tsolyáni Career Paths

### Life in the Temple

After joining a temple and attending to your duties after about a year and attaining your First Circle, the new acolyte must pick a branch of the temple to enter: Administrative, Ritual, Scholar, Temple Guard\ Warrior-Priests, or Lay-Priests.Changing branches is very rare and it’s more common for someone to switch from being in a very active role to becoming a Lay-Priest to pursue their own interests, however switching to Lay-Priest is a one way decision.

Clan status shapes a priest's responsibilities. High-clan clergy ended up involved in rituals sooner than Lower-clan, perhaps holding the holy scrolls for the ritual Priests, or singing in the antiphonal choirs. Lower-clan’s commonly work in libraries, as scholars, do the accounting for the temple in offices, or greet and guide visitors to the shrines of Aspects.

It is very rare for anyone to retire from the priesthood - usually this would only be due to ill health, political disfavour or the pressure of clan interests. Since most priestly careers are very limiting on freedom, players who dislike a tight rein should opt for the relative latitude given to Lay-Priests. Otherwise you must expect only to go on adventures that are assigned by your superiors.

**Ritual Priests** (commonly any magic-using class)

The Ritual branch of a temple is responsible for performing all the temples rituals, as well as public speaking on theology and orthodoxy (which Scholars would have prepared). Ritual Priests start out as assistants to senior priests, holding books and censers, singing in choirs. As acolytes learn more they get more responsibility and duties with greater visibility; performing sacrifices and other rites, to eventually become the senior celebrant in the temples elaborate rituals, the public ones as well as the secret and dangerous ones.

**Scholar-Priests** (commonly any magic-using class)

The scholarly branch of a temple is responsible for advancing the knowledge in any field the temple values. Starting as instructors for children's classes under the watch of their predecessors until a senior Priest is satisfied, then moving upwards is education and study, to eventually be contributing to the studies and research of senior Scholars, and then working on their own works. Scholars commonly must write a thesis or other articles of knowledge to justify their circle advancement at each circle.

Many magic-users are Scholar-Priests who specialise in the study of magic.

**Administrative Priests** (Any Class)

The administrative branch handles all day to day operations of running the temple, supervising servants and slaves, administrate over properties and temple resources, handle any logistics and so forth. Senior administrative Priests control great resources and political influence that shape a temples strategies.

**Lay-Priests** (Any Class)

Lay-Priests are not a part of temple hierarchies, as they receive their training in the theology of their deity and any other subject, then earn a living outside of the temples. They have access to their temples libraries and teacher, as well as being able to stay in the temple dormitories when needed, but the temple does not support them or give them specific duties.

Lay-Priests tend to be scholars, physicians, magicians, or a part of other noble profession. They sell their skills, hire out as house Preist, work for a senior Lay-Priest, magical bodyguards, or specialist. Magicians attached to legions in support roles are commonly Lay-Priests, but Military Magicians who do battle magic are not.

**Warrior-Priests & Guards** (Any Martial Weapon specialty class)

Temple guards and warriors are the security for temples, whose duties include routine guard duties, escorting senior priests, crowd control at public rituals, etc. The career path of a temple guard is very similar to that of a legionary.

War temples such as Karakán, Vimúhla, and their Cohorts, tend to promote their guards to temple-sponsored legions, while injured and retired legionaries rotate back to serve as temple guards.

### The Military

The Five Empires keep highly organized standing armies, so legion members need Military Rank. See Circle and Renown to find rank and title within the military.

Anyone who went on to join a legion will just be completing their five year enlistment period at age 20. During this time the character will have received basic training. After their enlistment period, people can either re-enlist or they can make use of their military training for personal gain by becoming a bodyguard, gladiator or adventurer.

Heavy Infantry

Medium Infantry/ Marine

Light Infantry or Archers

The weapons learned are those used by the legion, which varies by legion. Members of temple-run legions will be priestly Acolytes at least.

Marines should be treated as medium infantry except that they are more sailor than soldier.

Other military or paramilitary units include sappers, artillery, Sákbe road guards, tomb police, city militia and prison guards. These units lack glory and prestige.

A tirrikámu (sergeant) commands a semétl or squad of 20 soldiers. A heréksa (Lieutenant) leads a karéng or company of 100 soldiers, and a Kási (Captain) commands a tsurúm or cohort of 400 soldiers. A niqómi or legion is composed of 20 cohorts (8000). Each legion has two molkár (majors) who command the left and right wings of the legion in battle, and two dritlán (colonels) who assist the kérdu (general) as his staff.

### The Imperial Bureaucracy Civil Service

The life of a bureaucrat need not be as tedious as it sounds. There are few opportunities for derring-do, admittedly, but it’s an ideal basis for stratagems and intrigues.

Any literate character of high clan can become a bureaucrat. In Tsolyánu, this is a position within one of the Four Palaces of the Empire:

- the Palace of the Realm (government bureaucracy)
- the Palace of Ever-Glorious War (military bureaucracy)
- the Palace of the Priesthood of the Gods (religious bureaucracy)
- the Palace of Foreign Lands (diplomatic bureaucracy).

A bureaucrat can expect to rise in the hierarchy until he reaches a Circle equivalent to his social status. To progress beyond this point he will need ability, luck, wealth (for lavish gifts to his superiors), the right political connections, and talent for intrigue. Good looks also help, this being a quality much admired by the Tsolyáni.

The clans that dominate the most senior positions (XIVth Circle and up) locally are Sea Blue, Golden Sunburst, Golden Bough, and Jade Diadem.

The clans most widespread in the upper hierarchy (IXth through XIIIth Circles) are White Crystal, Purple Gem, Standing Stone, and Joyous of Vra.

The clans with most members in the middle positions (IVth through VIIIth Circle) are Blue Kirtle, Black Stone, Scroll of Wisdom, Iron Plume and Victorious Globe.

The clans figuring prominently in the lower echelons (up to IIIrd Circle) are Plume of White, Sunlit Dome and High Tower.

#### The Palace of the Realm

[http://www.Tékumel.com/eoasw3_04.html](http://www.tekumel.com/eoasw3_04.html)

The Palace of the Realm of the Glorious and Ever-living God King, Master of the Many Universes and Emperor of All, is one of the four departments of the Tsolyáni civil service, It is responsible for all domestic affairs including taxation, law enforcement, land ownership, records and public works. There is a branch of the Palace of the Realm in every town. The Palace in Jakálla comprises a vast complex of buildings situated on the south bank of the Equ’noyel River, below the Governor’s Palace.

##### The Eight Departments of The Palace of the Realm

**The Department of Domestic Affairs**

It includes these sub departments:

- **The Registry of Births, Marriages and Deaths**

a natural contraceptive, lisutl root, was genetically engineered by the original colonists of Tékumel, is used and keeps birth rates within limit.

- **The Registry of Aridani Declarations**

Here women may come to declare themselves legally independent. The woman is then Aridani, meaning that she has all the legal rights and responsibilities of a man. Aridani status is necessary for any woman who wishes to carry on a career outside her clan—eg, in the priesthood, army or bureaucracy.

- **The Registry of Conferral of Citizenship and Rights to Permanent Residence**
- **The Registry of Malefactors**

This maintains a partial list of known or suspected wrongdoers. Others are kept by the Department of the Seven Commissioners, the Marble Mansion of Metlunel I, the Palace of Ever-Glorious War, and the Omnipotent Azure Legion.

**The Department of the Seven Commissioners**

- **Tax affairs**

sub-department comprises the _Office of Assessment of Clan Worth_, the _Office of Collation of Revenue Reports_ (which maintains a network of spies and informers) and the _Office for the Organization of Tax Collection_ (which employs gangs of former legionaries to scour the countryside).

- **The Imperial Mint**

is charged with minting and distribution of coins and the prevention of counterfeiting.

- **The Stamping Office**

Marks weights and measures for use in the marketplace, etc, to show that they have been verified by Imperial officials. Falsification of such a stamp is an Imperial crime, though in fact the cost and time rquired to get weights checked deters most merchants (even the honest ones) from bothering to get this done.

- **The Provincial Treasury**

This might look like a lure to thieves, but it is well-guarded by a crack contingent of the militia and is also reputed to have sorcerous wards.

**The Marble Mansion of Metlunel I**

- **The Imperial Courts**, comprising the Court of Ten Pillars, the Court of Delegates and the Court of Thirteen Pillars.
- **The Civil Courts**, comprising the First and Third Appellate Courts, the Court of the Brazen Dais and the Court of Pleadings.
- **The Office of Interrogation** is operated by members of the Clan of the Edification of the Soul. This is a small tightly-knit clan of low social prestige but great importance in legal matters because its members are traditionally the only people (other than officers of the Omnipotent Azure Legion) who are able to apply judicial torture. A Mri (literally "Quartet") of four orange-robed members of the clan, each wearing the lizard-like mask of the god Chiténg, must be present at any torture or public execution.
- **The Gallery of Expectation** contains cells for those undergoing trial. (Some of these "cells" can be quite luxurious if one gives the police guards a large enough bribe.)
- **The Office of Debt Reclaimation** is where a person found guilty of bankruptcy will be held while his clan is given the chance to pay his debts. If this is not done within a few weeks, the unfortunate bankrupt is handed over to the slaver’s clan for sale, and the proceeds are disbursed to his creditors.

**The Department of the Third Courtyard**

- **The Office of Marketplaces**. This office is responsible for issueing trading permits (but not customs or foreign trade) and appoints market magistrates. It maintains close liaison with the market police.
- **The Registry of Slaves** keeps track of all slaves passing through the slave market. You’ve arrived in town to find your gambling addicted cousin has gone missing? Here’s the place to start the search—as long as you’re prepared to wade through several hundred scrolls’ worth of documentation!

**The Department of Agency and Exertion**

- **The Battalions of the Province**. The militia are drilled as medium infantry, but are unlikely to see battle unless civil war should break out. More often their duties are to act as police (including market police, but not prison or tomb guards), fire wardens and nightwatchmen.
- **The Supervisorship of the Arena** deals mainly with Imperial ceremonies to be held at the Hililakte. These are held to celebrate military victories and are useful in creating a sense of national unity which is not a natural part of the Tsolyáni psyche. Other impromptu entertainments may be needed to distract a restless populace, and it is important to move quickly on such occasions.
- **The Office of Imperial Benevolence** contracts civic work out to the clans—for example, the recent renovation of the abandoned temple of the Unknown One.
- **The Office of Imperial Puissance** deals with the rental of state resources and also (more often) the co-option of labour for huge projects such as the erection of Imperial monuments or the rebuilding of a city through Ditlana ("renewal"). In theory all property belongs to the Imperium and it has the right to co opt labour without payment. In practice only about 30% of the economy is directly controlled and administered by the state, and "compulsory" labour has to be paid for by favours and behind-the-scenes agreements with the chiefs of the clans.
- **The Colonnade of Illumination** sees to the hiring of scholars (usually lay-priests of the various temples) as expert advisors, who are then assigned to department as needed.

**The Department of Accession and Embarkation**

- **The Collectorship of Gate Tolls** supervises the issuance of travel permits. (It is necessary to have an official document stating your clan if you travel outside your home city. This can be had for about 2 Kaitars. You might have to wait a week or two.) This office sees to the levying of tolls, not just at the main city gates but at certain bridges and by-ways of historical privilege.
- **The Office of Harbour Maintenance** oversees maritime matters in the Equ’noyel and MiSsúma estuaries, being responsible for the harbour defences, port security, and the proclamation of storm warnings. (For the last of these, a priest of Karakán is always on hand to cast divinations.)

**The Hallway of the Twelve Columns**

- **the Office of Maintenance of the Roads**
- **the Office of Maintenance of the City Walls**
- **the Office of Maintenance of the Prisons**

**The Department of the City of Lasting Repose**

- **The Office for the Erection of Tombs and Monuments**, which evaluates the cost of works decreed by Avanthar and then passes on its requirements to the Department of Agency and Exertion.
- **The Office for the Recovery of Stolen Materials** has charge of a unit of the city militia whose special responsibility is the tracing of items stolen from the nobility or from the Imperium itself. Items stolen from tombs are not within this office’s purview, falling instead under the jurisdiction of the tomb police.

#### The Omnipotent Azure Legion

The offices of the Omnipotent Azure Legion (OAL) are commonly situated within the Governor’s Palace itself, north of the Palace of the Realm. Officers of the intelligence arm of the Legion deal with matters of the highest state security: treason, zu’ur smuggling, espionage, diabolism, mutiny and rioting. This department also keeps a close watch on bureaucrats and police. As OAL Captain Arodai hiNaqumar says: "Who watches the watchmen? We do, pal, and don’t you forget it!"

## Clans of Tsolyani

**Clan and Lineage**

Tsolyánu is a stratified society which allows for little mixing between social classes. People from very different backgrounds would almost never become friends. Some walks of life, such as the army, do not segregate so rigidly. It would be possible for one young Heréksa (roughly "lieutenant") to befriend an infantryman in his command. But while a degree of camaraderie with the ranks would be acceptable, ultimately the Heréksa is the one calling the shots. The situation requires the other to be subservient.

The vast majority of people in Tsolyánu, Mu’ugalavyá, and Yán Kór belong to a clan, whose rules govern social and economic life. Clans are organized relatively simple compared to the complexity of Temples and Government, you’re born a Clan-Brother or Clan-Sister. Only ambitious charismatic, competent leaders, with a lifetime of service to the clan may be chosen by the clan-house to become a Clan-Elder.

Being elected as a Clan-Elder commonly also means you are devoted to the temple of the clan. If your clan-house is in the far north of the empire (closer toYán Kór), women are far more likely to being Clan-Elders, well men are more common in the south (not even senior Aridáni).

Traditions differ, but most clanhouse councils are 5-20 Clan-Elders, depending on the size of the clanhouse. They meet once a week to discuss things such as formulation of policies, the settlement of minor issues, allocate funds to projects and needs, etc. The council selects one member to serve as head of the clanhouse. Clan-Elders and Clan-Heads server for five years. A Clan-Head represents his clanhouse at regional and national meetings of the clan and to the councils in the Palace of the Realm, when needed. Some clans are powerful, others feeble and plebeian. Most clans boast several lineages, which vary in status.

People are bonded by belonging to the same clan. Regardless of lineage, members of a clan give mutual trust, aid and comradeship. Someone of low lineage are "poor country cousins" who must be appropriately courteous to their more prestigious urban relatives, but this relationship is sufficiently close to be tenable.

Clans are generally collections of families of a similar faith and trade. This varies from clan-to-clan, with the more powerful clans holding more strictly to their identities (the Golden Bough clan, for instance, is a conservative Stability clan, meaning its members are generally Hnálla, Thúmis or Avánthe worshippers of high status), while the lower clans are less rigid: the Black Mat clan which weaves sleeping mats, for instance. There are members of the Golden Bough clan who have gone on to worship the Change gods Chiténg or Hrihiyal, but they are definitely "black sheep" (or "black hma" as the case may be). The Black Mat clan has no time for such niceties: "Just weave yer accursed mat and shut up!"

Some clans are "religious clans" (Cloak of Azure Gems), while others are "professional clans" -- various mercantile clans pay only lip-service to a religious faith. And again, the richer you are, the better a show you have to put on. The poorer you are, the less anyone cares.

Tsolyánu has over 1500 recognized clans.

**Joining a Clan**

Foreigners can be offered membership into a clan, The person(s) would need to hold true to the clans values and interest, plus pay a handsome fee to join. 1000-6000 káitars for joining a Very Low or Low clan; 7000-12000 to join a Medium clan; 25000-45000 to join a High clan. To join a Very High Clan you would need the sponsorship of an Imperial Prince or Emperor. If you are a part of a clan and wish to advance yourself into a higher clan, you would need to pay substantially more (1.5-2 times more) as you also must compensate your current clan for leaving.

### The CLANLESS

People without a clan are at the bottom of the heap in Tsolyáni society. Well off foreigners can receive a certain amount of respect, but foreigners and other clanless people are worth less than slaves and are treated accordingly.

# Part 7: Spellcasting

## Pedhetl

Spellcasting on Tékumel is based on magical psychic energy resource that draws on the energy of the Planes Beyond which can be channeled to create powerful effects. Tékumel spellcasters use the Spell Points Variant form the DMG5e (p.288), which is called Pedhetl.

Every creature, sentient or otherwise, has Pedhetl, which can be used, manipulated and restored by those trained in its use. There is the belief that a creature's Pedhetl is doubled at the moment a creature crosses over unto death, which is a reason for ritual sacrifices when performing powerful ritual magic.

Magic is built through Psychic and Ritual processes taught by the Temples in the empires. As such, what follows are the changes to the standard D&D spellcasting and spell lists.

## Temple Spells

Each Temple specializes in different aspects of spells.

Although sorcery is not dependent on the gods for it to work, the temples are the main sources of learning how to do it. Those priests who choose to specialize in sorcery are called "sorcerer/priests". Those who learn sorcery but choose to be somewhat aloof of their temple are called "lay-priests" or "jack-priests". Sorcerers are only taught those spells known to their temple (and the body of spells common to all temples).

**UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES MAY A PERSON LEARN A SPELL BELONGING TO ANOTHER TEMPLE**. Temple sorcery is a tightly guarded secret, and those that betray those secrets can expect to be hunted down and executed in the most horrible fashion imaginable. Even scrolls of temple spells are enchanted so that only worshippers of the same deity (or his/her cohort) may use it. If a person wishes to abandon their faith and join another temple, their memory is wiped so that they cannot remember their spells, and they must start over. Notice that there are some spells common to all temples; these are not kept secret because everybody already knows them.

Whether one is a cleric (sorcerer-priest) or a wizard (lay priest) makes little practical difference in terms of capabilities. The differences mainly lie in personality, one's connections with the temple, and how involved one wishes to be in temple politics.

If you’re wanting to be as close to _AD&D_ rules as possible. Simply use ordinary wizard and cleric rules for spell casting.

Both wizards and clerics may hire tutors, find scrolls, etc. to learn additional spells. Neither wizards nor clerics need spell­books: when they learn a spell, they know how to cast it. Spell books are used exclusively as teaching instruments here. Spells are memorized by sleep and meditation or prayer.

Both wizards and clerics may wear nothing heavier than leather armor when spell­casting (no shield!), but clerics are allowed to wear heavier armor if they are not spell-casting. Chlen-hide armor also obstructs spell casting by restricting the freedom of movement needed to cast spells properly. This is mostly because in the Five Empires on Tékumel, armor is very ornate.

## Psychic Magic

Psychic magic does not require extensive paraphernalia or incantations, simply concentration and a perceptible target.

Psychic Magic is any spell that is cast in one round or less (6 seconds). These spells will generally be Instantaneous or require concentration to maintain. Psychic Magic tends not to require verbal, somatic, or material components.

## Ritual Magic

Ritual spells require a unique mind-set, gestures, vocalisations, attitudes, and specific paraphernalia (substances, diagrams, sacrifices, etc.) and are capable of much more complex effects. Ritual Magic is any spell that is or can be cast over time. Any spell that has a duration greater than Instantaneous can be cast as Ritual Magic.

Spells cast as Ritual Magic take 10 minutes longer to cast than normal. The spell doesn’t expend a spell slot, so the spell is not upcast unless the spell points are spent to cast it at a higher level.

The spellcaster needs the space to conduct the ritual, meaning they need the following:

- A stable space to stand and work
- Sufficient space to move around
- Be unencumbered
- Be able to move freely around the space
- Not wear any armour
- Not be interrupted

If any conditions are not met, or they change well concentrating on the spell, the spell fails.

## Metal and the Spellcaster

On Tékumel, metal disrupts spell casting, which is one reason spellcasters wear no armor (and carry no coins or metal weapons). Contact with metal grounds the use of both psychic and ritual magic (though this has no effect once the spell is cast). If the caster carries one psé (750 grams, a pound is 454 grams) of metal. Lesser amounts do not cause spell failure (so the character can safely carry a steel dagger). However, copper and bronze do have a reduced effect.

Spellcasters must make Concentration check if they have or are within 5 feet of over 1 lb of metal.The DC is 8 +1 per pound of metal. If there is 10+ lbs of metal, make the check at disadvantage. If the spellcaster fails, the spell merely fails. Cantrips automatically fail, and the caster takes 1 point of psychic damage, even if the caster past the Concentration check.

If a spellcaster critically fails the Concentration check, they take 1d8 points of psychic damage per level of spell they cast (or are concentrating on), as well as lose the spell they were casting or concentrating on. This affects spell scrolls as well but not items imbued with magical effect, such as Wands, staffs and other such items. Cantrips automatically fail, and the caster takes 1 point of psychic damage.

## Magic Dampeners \ Psychic Dampener

Spells cannot be cast within one meter of the character (friendly or hostile) who is a Magic Dampener. The character cannot be psychically read or detected, and cannot cast magical Spells of any kind. Magical items that draw upon the user’s energy cannot be used at all within the affected area (by the character or by others). Items that possess charges may be used once within the affected area but must be removed from the area around the Dampener before being able to activate another charge (the next charge will not “load” within the dampened area). The character cannot activate scrolls, books, inscriptions, or other "triggered" enchantments — those that require a psychic "spark" from the reader. Thus, a Dampener can read a scroll but it will not activate but he or she also cannot trigger a sorcerous trap that requires reading.

About 1 person in 20 is a Psychic Dampener, of opposite magical polarity to the rest of the human race. No spells can be cast within a metre of them. Spells cast from outside that zone might still affect him, but even then there is a chance equal to his Psychic Ability of the spell simply "fizzling out". Eyes and other technological devices are not affected.

## Fertile and Barren Magic Areas

Some parts of Tékumel have more inherent magic than others, and spellcasting is altered thereby.

Spells cast within "fertile" lands cost only 1/2 normal Spell Points. The cost of spellcasting is halved in magically rich locations. These include the cities of makuyál, Púrdimal, Avanthár and Sárku in Tsolyánu, Ch’óchi in Mu’ugalavyá, Jgrésh in Salarvyá, and most of the east coast of Livyánu.

Spells cast within "barren" lands cost twice the normal Spell Points. One such is the long swathe of terrain from Chayákku to Nuru’ún in the far north.

There are also magically dead areas where sorcery does not work at all. Among these are the Plain of Towers, the Dry Bay of Ssu’úm, and the Tsoléi archipelago. Even magico-technological devices can only function once, and then cannot be used again until returned to a more fertile locale..

## Ceremonial and Temple Sorcery

Each priesthood has supranormal effects which can be achieved by groups of ritual priests working together in a ceremony. Ceremonies of this sort are part of everyday religious activity in Tsolyánu and the sorcery they evoke cannot be achieved by a single individual, no matter how skilled. The ceremony is effectively a spell worked by several casters in unison. The priests involved must fulfil the requirements to use Ritual magic though they need not know any other sorcery apart from the special chants and dances of the ceremony.

Effects that can be achieved include the enhancing of weaponry by the Temples of Vimúhla and Karakán and the enrichment of harvests by the Temple of Avánthe. Usually ceremonial magic is only undertaken at certain times of the year, most often on the holy days of the temple in question.

## Great Magic

Great Magic is High Level Spells cast by epic level beings, and groups of spell casters commonly within a temple.

There are techniques that go far beyond the spells taught in temples. These are the mysteries of immortality, the creation of life, and the means of commanding the elements and rules of other planes.

They have been re-discovered throughout history by wizards of legendary renown: Qiyór the Many-Tongued, Hagárr of Paránta, Subadím the Sorcerer and others. But these savants guarded their secrets jealously, so that little is known of Great Magic by the scholars of today.

The wizards who are destined to achieve greatness become increasingly withdrawn from their former lives and are likely to go off to meditate alone in the wilderness, rarely involving themselves with the mundane world. Such a study might involve more than a single ordinary life span and the wizard (if he or she survives) would of necessity be greatly changed by the end of it. Taking the road of the Undying Wizard’s.

## Tactical Magic of the Five Empires

Spell casters in the Tsolyanu army can have the opportunity to be part of a magical contingent. The basic of which is the spell caster being used as magical psychic energy resource that can be channeled to more powerful spell casters.

Each legion has a contingent of some 50-100 military sorcerers whose function is to provide large-scale sorcery in battle. Usually these are junior priests, young and therefore capable of bearing up under the rigours of campaigning, led by a few more senior mages. Such a magical contingent (called a Shatsúr) is either provided by the legion’s patron temple(s) or recruited and assigned by the Palace of Ever-Glorious War.

By participating in a group ritual, the military sorcerers achieve a kind of gestalt in which they are able to cast spells of enormous force. The sky above the battlefield is then lit up by great meteors of flame rebounding off invisible defensive shields, while other effects include miasmas in which phantom armies can be glimpsed, clamorous dins which confuse enemy troops and sap their resolve, and gusts of fresh or foul air.

No personal sorcery can be used on or near the battlefield while the military contingent maintain their rituals. One theory for this is that military magic drains all other-planar energy in the vicinity, leaving none available to power the spells of individual mage’s.

Military magic is highly ceremonial and cannot be used by individuals or in non-military situations. It is extremely puissant but lacks the versatility and fine control of personal magic.

### The Magical Contingent

For a spell caster to join a tactical magic contingent just as a battery, they must at least have the spell _Lens of Power_, and have trained with a contingent for at least a week.

Other members of the contingent should have _The Summit of the Mountain of Power_, and the lead spell caster must have prepared the high level spells well in advance and worked with the contingent for many months.

All Tactical Magic requires spells to be Upcast as 10 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) level spells and cast as ritual spells (10+ mins to cast). Tactical Magic also uses the mean average of spell damage, so a Tactical Magic Fireball is cast as a 10 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) level spell 15d6 Fire Damage for an average of 60 Fire damage, save for half (60/30). Tactical Magic is also measured in meters, not feet.

**More in the document Tactical Magic of the Five Empires.**

# Casting the Psychic-Magic of EPT

## Concentration

Whenever you must make a concentration check, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain or cast a new spell.

### Casting a Spell

The DC equals 10 or half the damage you’ve taken since your last round plus the spell level of the spell you’re trying to cast (1-10).

You can add an ability modifier depending on what type of spell you're trying to cast, Psychic or Ritual:

**Psychic spells**: Add your wisdom.

**Ritual Spells**: Add your intelligence.

### Concentration is broken if:

- Casting another spell that requires concentration.
- Taking damage and a concentration check is failed.
- Being incapacitated or killed.

## Spell Phylum

The grouping of spells related to each other that must be learned in phylum order. This is represented as Universal Spells (U),General Spells (G), Temple or Shaman Spells (T).

Universal Spells are widely known and freely taught by any temple.

General Spells are lesser known and only taught at certain temples.

Temple Spells are only taught at very specific temples.

## Changes to Spells

### Alignment

### Stability and Change only. As we know, these do not correspond with "good" and "evil", but because _AD&D_'s spell list orients their spells this way, consider Stability as "good" and Change as "evil"--for spell purposes only! A "Protection from Evil" spell therefore becomes a "Protection from Change" spell; worshippers of Change do not necessarily have to act in an evil fashion.

### Summoning

All spells summoning monsters, shadows, etc. have been deleted, as have spells involving riding. There are no riding animals on Tékumel to speak of, so there's no reason to believe wizards would have developed such spells. There is no such thing as elementals, either. However, every temple can summon "demons" (other planar beings) who generally support that temple's goals. These servants may be treated like AD&D Tanari'i or Baatezu (or whatever they're called these days), but they come in both Stability and Change flavors. Demons of Change do tend to be quite as nasty as Tanari'i; there is little description of Demons of Stability to judge them.

### The Planes

Tékumel has rich connections to other planes, and there is a swarming infinity of "Demon Planes" around the Tékumel universe.

On Tékumel, one travels via "Nexus Points", which are more like AD&D's Gate spell, in that they go directly from one plane to another. However, there is no guarantee that a Nexus Point will take you to your destination-¬you must step from plane to plane, traversing a series of Nexus Points to get to where you want. Thus, even if you simply want to get to another place on Tékumel, 100 miles away, you may have to cross five demon planes in order to get there.

"_Contact Higher Plane_", simply contacts either one's deity, or one of the lesser races serving him/her. You don't specify the plane you re-quest information from so much as the being you request information from.

An astral character becomes insubstantial and transparent, and can travel far distances more quickly than normally. The astral character may cross Nexus Points or go to other planes.

## D&D Spells on Tékumel:

Spells are not broken down by schools of magic. Instead, they are divided by subject matter. As for clerics, wizards must choose a deity to worship, as their choice of spells will depend on their temple. Wizards may learn spells from their temples list and the All list. As noted above, wizards are not permitted to choose spells from other temple lists no matter what the circumstance, nor may they ever cast spells from other temples, even if they find a scroll. Note that some spells are duplicated, and may be learned and used by different temples; this is okay.

### Adding Spells to Temples

There are an incredible number of spells out there. Add them as you see fit; here are some guidelines that I used to choose where they belong.

In general, the higher level a spell is, the more restricted to one deity it is likely to be.

1. Used the Swords and Glory list to guide in which temples specialized in which kinds of magic. The list above should give you plenty of hints, too.
2. Try to keep spells consistent. If illusion spells are generally found in the temples of Hnálla, Belkhánu, Hrü'ǘ, Sárku, and Dlamélish, don't put an illusion spell in Ksárul's list for no reason.
3. No spells involving monster summoning or creation, Elementals, or specific other planes are included, nor are spells that depend on wild magic randomness for their effects.

### Spells Alterations

**Animate Dead**

Produces one Mrúr or Tsóggu (they are undead despite the description in the bestiary) per two caster levels. See Zombie under the spell heading for more details.

**Create Undead**

An 11th level or higher caster may create Shédra, and A 16th level or higher caster may create Hrü'ǘ.

**Create Greater Undead**

A 15th level or higher caster may create Vorodlá, and a 18th level or higher caster may create Hrá.

# Religion

The religious systems of the Five Empires are based on two ‘alignments’ (Stability and Change), each represented in the Engsvanyáli pantheon by five major ‘Gods’ (Stability: the Tlomitlányal; Change: the Tlokiriqáluyal) and five ‘Cohorts’ (the Hlimékluyal).

Information in this section paraphrased from Swords and Glory Volume 1, M.A.R. Barker, Copyright ©1983 Gamescience.

These deities are really vastly powerful interdimensional beings, though ‘gods’ to the limited being that is man. For a discussion of these beings and the Scrolls of Pavár, see the relevant History entry. The most comprehensive source of material about Tsolyáni religion and ritual is Mitlanyál.

There are no "formal" inter-religious allegiances, save the brief ones which lead to short-term mutual advantage and they dissolve when the first person blinks. Yes, Stability and Change temples tend to keep to themselves, but there are enough similarities of interest that you will occasionally see _Ksárul_ working with _Hnálla_ or _Avánthe_ with _Hrü'ǘ_. Not often, though.

There are monasteries, but they tend to be hard to find. There is a _Hnálla_ monastery in the mountains southeast of _Sunraya_, a _Vimúhla_ monastery west of _Tumissa_, and a _Thúmis_ monastery out there somewhere. These are not collections of chaste sophants moaning litanies to the gods (well, maybe in _Thúmis'_ case), but are centers of power for the temples, magical research, and respite from the political melting pot of the empire proper. Part of the reason these monasteries are hard to find is because they are generally on side-planes and are only anchored to these physical locations tenuously. People have been to the _Thúmis_ monastery twice and have yet to determine where its physical location might be.

## The Concordat

The Concordat is an agreement between the 20 major religions agreeing to avoid civil war. It does not cover the Pariah Deities (She Who Must Not Be Named, The One, and The One Other) whose aim is to destroy all existence. It is generally assumed that people from the Five Empires worship the same group of “gods” and their “cohorts” (Pavar “discovered” a total of 20) under different names and levels of understanding. Everyone assumes they have a clearer picture than those “poor, ignorant heathen from [insert country other than your own here]”.

Around witnesses, especially in towns, the Concordat holds. Acts of violence between religious groups are not tolerated. Outside civilized areas, in the seamy parts of town, and especially the Underworld, watch yourself...

# The Gods of Tékumel

The gods are very real, and their priests have many magic spells at their disposal. There are two major houses of gods in Tsolyanu, the Gods of Stability and the Gods of Change.

Although they bear some resemblance to good and evil pantheons from traditional fantasy, the Lords of Change are not thought of as wicked or wrong, just different, nor are the Lords of Stability wholly good. Rather than the Silmarils vs. the Nazgul, the two houses of gods are more like the Vorlons and the Shadows, each with some valid points, each with some excesses.

All the nations who were once a part of great Éngsvanyàlu subscribe to the same basic truths, that the eternal battle between the Tlomítlanyal (the Lords of Glory) and the Tlokìriqáluyal (the Masters of Shadow) defines all that exists. But there are certain demons who are allied to neither good nor evil; there are Undying Wizards who chuckle at such pieties, and there is The One Other, a god recognized by, and yet not included in, the religion which culturally unites all of the Five Empires.

Contact with the gods, direct, personal experience of them, is common and verifiable. The techniques first written down by Pavar are spread through all the cultures of Tékumel and they know how to reach out to the beings they worship. From the parts of Pavar's work we have, these techniques give an impression of the nature of those gods, their personalities. These are objective facts that can't be rewritten by human whim or social pressures.  
  
All this tends to clamp down on human urges to syncreatism.  
That said the people of Tékumel can only see those parts of the trans-dimensional beings they worship which mortal minds can appreciate and perceive. There may be aspects of these beings that Tékumel never sees. And just as the Tsolyani can't rewrite the nature of these beings they can't rewrite the instincts and social urges of their mortal followers. To realise their ends (whatever they may be) they have to use the mortal minds and purposes of their followers. So we might speculate that Avanthe has little or no real interest in agriculture except as it reflects a stable set of spiritual values. (Or maybe she doesn't give a toss about spiritual values and the whole Temple is a vast  
conspiracy to produce more animal waste products: what do I know about the motivations of gods?)  
But I think that speculation about the relationship between the twenty gods and cohorts and the Pariah Gods (especially the legend of Ksarul) is indeed likely to skirt the central 'mystery of Tékumel'. Whatever that may be.....

(by Mike Cule)

## Hnálla

Lord of light, The Supreme Principle of Stability, the Lord Whose True Name May Not Be Known, Master of Light, and Foe of Change.

![[hnalla.webp]]

Hnálla seeks light without darkness and the ultimate presence of Changeless Radiance throughout the cosmos. He is the final goal towards which the other Lords of Stability strive, each in his or her own fashion.

He aids those who serve Stability, rewards those who establish and maintain the order of things, and provides for those who are industrious, pious, temperate, and of dignified mien.

Hnálla is depicted as an abstract symbol: a double joined circle (like the ‘infinity’ symbol). He has 51 known Aspects. His priests and priestesses wear white robes and silver skullcaps.

**Power Centres**

Hnálla is esteemed throughout Tsolyánu, Mu’ugalavyá and Yán Kór. In Tsolyánu, he is strongest in the central regions along the Mssúma River.

**Factions**

The Pure Light Society of the temple of Hnálla supports Thúmis’ more pacifistic factions.

### Drá, Cohort of Hnálla

The Cohort of Hnálla is Drá: the Uncaring, Singer of the Hymns of the Gods. He is difficult to comprehend; the total disinterest of the Perfect Light in the phenomenal things of this universe. Drá is thus the closest thing to a ‘mystical’ deity to be found on Tékumel; his followers affect complete indifference to this world. Drá is shown as a lumpish, unkempt, and unremarkable man of middle years dressed in a tattered and dirty robe. His emblem is a pair of circles connected horizontally by a wavy line; he has no known Aspects.

**Followers**

Allied with HNALLA, priests resemble fakirs--bed of nails, self-flagellation, fasting, walking through beds of coals barefoot, etc.

![[karakan.webp]]
## Karakán

The Lord of War, Master of Heroes, and the Ultimate Warrior on the Final Day.

Karakán serves Stability through active change, but change always towards a more stable social order, war for the expression of courage, war for the destruction of the Dark and the victory of Light. He aids those who are valorous.

Karakán is shown as a youthful champion with a head rather like that of a hawk, winged, and armed with a sword and shield. His emblem is a stylised lightning bolt. He has 56 Aspects. Priests and Aridáni warrior women of his sect wear red robes, armour, and tall golden helmets with fanciful scarlet crests. Other devotees attire themselves in scarlet garments and bear Karakán's emblem upon a breast amulet.

**Power Centres**

Like Hnálla, Karakán is worshipped throughout Tsolyánu, but has his strongest enclaves in the central lands.

**Factions**

The Sword of Righteousness Clan of Karakán's temple urges an active role in politics, and has been known to collaborate with the Incandescent Blaze Society of Vimúhla to support military expansionism.

### Chegárra, Cohort of Karakán

The Cohort of Karakán is Chegárra: the Hero-King, Swordsman of Glory and Victorious Lord. He is ‘Courage Applied’: the experienced warrior, the resourceful ruler, the sagacious statesman, and the patron of armies. He is shown as a bearded soldier of early middle years, fully armoured, and often striding forth over the bodies of slain demons. His emblem is a double-headed silver axe, and he has 33 Aspects.

## Thúmis

Lord of Wisdom and knowledge, Knower of Arts, Hidden Seeker of Eternal Knowledge, Sage of the Gods

![[thumis.webp]]

Thúmis seeks total wisdom, cognition without the limitations of the ego, and an understanding of the universe in order to serve the eventuation of Hnálla’s Changeless Radiance.

Thúmis aids those who seek knowledge for the benefit of society; and who heal, teach and study.

His commonest depiction is as a seated scholarly man with a golden halo and a book-roll in his hand. Some of his Aspects bear the traditional Staff of Power (although Thúmis was not worshipped until Engsvanyáli times), and the hem of his robe is blazoned with stylised eyes, signifying omniscience and wisdom. His sign is a square in which the Tsolyáni letter for ‘th’ is centred. He has 47 common Aspects, and his clergy (both males and females) wear grey robes and simple black skullcaps.

**Power Centres**

Thúmis is especially powerful in Tsolyánu at Páya Gupá, Béy Sü, and at Sokátis.

**Factions**

The Temple of Thúmis is dominated by the Brotherhood of Supernal Wisdom, which holds that Stability must triumph through the acquisition of knowledge, strong political action, and even missionary zeal—but not through violence. Smaller factions within Thúmis clergy argue that the temple should adopt a more militant stance, while still others urge no involvement in political life whatsoever.

### Keténgku, Cohort of Thúmis

The Cohort of Thúmis is Keténgku: the Many-Eyed, Knower of All, Master of Scrolls. He is ‘Wisdom Applied’: patron of scholars, physicians, apothecaries, scribes, architects, engineers, and all those who use knowledge for the benefit of society. He is represented as a bald, seated scribe holding a book-scroll open upon his knee. He has four faces looking in each of the four cardinal directions, signifying his omniscience; his symbol is a stylised silver eye, and he has 27 Aspects.

![[avanthe.webp]]
## Avánthe

Mother goddess, Mistress of Heaven, Maid of Beauty, Mother of Devotion, Wife (in a nonphysical sense) to Hnálla.

Avánthe seeks a smooth-running and well-ordered world, one in which all things flow gently along towards Hnálla’s final Perfect Light. She stresses a patterned rhythm of cooperation and symbiosis, and her ceremonies commemorate the cycles of nature: the spring, sowing, the rains, and the harvests. Avánthe aids women in all circumstances, those who maintain the clan and the community, men and women who are devout pillars of society, the supporters of justice, and those who struggle against Change.

Her symbol is a circle with rays descending from it. She has 93 Aspects, and her priests wear sky-blue robes and chaplets of gold, while her priestesses wear similar robes but have headdresses of blue-lacquered Chlén-hide and golden bracelets and armbands.

**Power Centres**

Avánthe is popular throughout Tsolyánu, but especially in the central regions along the Mssúma River.

**Factions**

The Girdle of Purity society of the Temple of Avánthe desires stronger, more militant measures and an active role in politics.

### Dilinála, Cohort of Avánthe

The Cohort of Avánthe is Dilinála : the Lovely Maiden of the Turquoise Crown, Aid of Lovers, Solace to the Weary and Handmaiden of Avánthe. She is ‘Woman as Woman Alone’: femininity without the polarity of male versus female; the innocent virgin, the beloved daughter, the loyal sister, the platonic confidante to whom a lover may tell his yearnings, the wise woman of many years, and even woman in love with woman. She is represented as a demure woman of great beauty and chaste purity holding out her hands to comfort the worshipper; her emblem is a hand extended, palm down, in silver and blue on a light blue field. She has only 9 known aspects.

## Belkhánu

God of afterlife, Lord of the Excellent Dead, Master of the Paradises of Teretané, Opener of the Gates of Heaven.

![[belkhanu.webp]]

Belkhánu sphere is not of this world but of the life after death: the journey onward to the farther Planes and the eventual goal of Hnálla’s Perfect Light.

He aids those who are close to death, those who mourn, those who would contact the dead, those who fight against Change, and those who are attacked by Sárku’s undead minions, an abomination to him.

His commonest form is that of a four-armed being with a round, featureless head. In each hand he bears one of the insignia of Paradise: a yellow gem, a staff, a bowl, and an orb of gold. His symbol is a golden ‘V’ resting upon three stylised waves. Belkhánu has 67 known Aspects. His priests wear yellow robes and tall yellow headdresses with a coif of gauze to mask the face. His priestesses are attired in similar costume, although the details differ.

**Power Centres**

The shrines of Belkhánu are found everywhere since his clergy are encharged with the funerals of the devotees of the Lords of Stability.

**Factions**

His temple is split between the Sect of the Golden Sphere of Eventual Transcendancy, which presses for a middle course between activism and pacifism, and the Group of the Amber Glow, which devotes itself to theological and doctrinal studies and has little to do with the concerns of this world.

### Qón, Cohort of Belkhánu

The Cohort of Belkhánu is Qón: the Ancient One of Pleasures, and Guardian of the Gates of Hell Against Those Who Would Come Forth. He protects the soul against the perils of the Hereafter, and aids those attacked by the powers of the Dark. He is depicted as a six-legged beast-like creature; in his forepaws he bears two carved maces. His symbol is a stylised mace set vertically, and he has 19 Aspects.

## Hrü'ǘ

![[hru'u.webp]]

Lord of Darkness, The Supreme Principle of Change, Master of Negation and Nonbeing, Opponent of Permanence, and Dispenser of Calamities.

Hrü'ǘ seeks the Dark, an end to choate form, a negation of this world of phenomena, and a return to the Nullity which existed when time was not. When this Nullity is achieved, he will then bring forth a new and chaotic beginning, and this in turn must be brought down, destroyed, and replaced with another Being, and so again and again for all time to come. He glories in Change without cessation, neverending, random and unpatterned, always roiling and shifting.

He aids those who fight for Change, those who attempt to undo the social order, those who bring about their own glory with no thought of others, and those who are of a secretive and yet grasping nature.

Hrü'ǘ is usually depicted as a bulbous, featureless circle of purple from which eight slender arms extend outward like the rays of the sun. In each of these hands he holds the insignia and devices of his power: swords, lamps, a barbed hook, a scroll, etc. His symbol is a circle of purple with a scarlet slash running down across it from left to right. The Aspects of Hrü'ǘ number 78. His priests and priestesses conceal themselves beneath purple robes and go masked in velvet and Chlén-hide shaped into the likenesses of his demon servitors.

**Power Centres**

The Temple of Hrü'ǘ is mightiest in Púrdimal, Mekú and Mrelú but has strengths elsewhere in Tsolyánu as well.

**Factions**

His temple is dominated by the Cusp of Night Society, which supports the Ndálu Clan who seek power through political intrigue.

### Wurú, Cohort of Hrü'ǘ

The Cohort of Hrü'ǘ is Wurú: the Unnameable, He Who Appears Where Evil Dwells, the Many-Legged Serpent of Doom. He is the active antagonist of Stability, pictured as a great serpent with many centipedal legs, antenna, and six great staring eyes. His symbol is a stylised serpent's head with tongue protruding, and he has 18 Aspects.

## Vimúhla

Lord of Fire, Power of Destruction and Red Ruin, Maker of Thunders, All-Consuming One.

![[vimuhla.webp]]

Vimúhla is the catharsis and the cleanser through the Flame. He would thus annihilate all matter and bring about the Final Conflagration, after which the cosmos must be reborn in the heart of the Flame, as Hrü'ǘ decrees. True victory is to he but an ephemeral, scintillating spark in the heart of the Inferno, then to know no more save the terrible burning joy of unity through annihilation.

He aids those who fight heroically and fanatically for Change, those who start conflagrations, and those who revel in destruction and pillage.

His usual depiction is as a coneshaped being with stylised flames in place of arms and legs, surrounded by black clouds shot through with orange-red lightnings. His symbol is a stylised flame. Vimúhla possesses 87 Aspects. His priests wear flame-orange robes, armour, and headdresses crowned with lacquered Chlén-hide flames. His priestesses are garbed in flame-orange skirts, collars of garnets and gold, and lighter coronets of gold with flame symbols engraved upon them. Both males and females leave their hair loose and unbound.

**Power Centres**

In Tsolyánu, Vimúhla has two very powerful foci: the west, particularly Tumíssa, Chéne Hó, and Khirgár; and the east around the city of Fasíltum. He is also the most powerful deity of Mu’ugalavyá; his temples are wealthier, and his clergy receive certain preferences.

**Factions**

The Temple of Vimúhla is partially controlled by the Incandescent Blaze Society, which urges violent action and intrigue but has little in common with the activists of the ‘Dark Trinity’ (Hrü'ǘ, Ksárul and Sárku) and instead sometimes collaborates with Karakán’s Sword of Righteousness Clan since both support military expansionism.

### Chiténg, Cohort of Vimúhla

The Cohort of Vimúhla is Chiténg: Lord of Red Spouting Flame, Drinker of Blood and Reaper of Cities. Known as ‘The Parched One’ to Milumanayáni desert clans.

He is the patron of the armies of Change, the besieger of cities, and the overseer of torments.

He is depicted as a mighty warrior covered with lizard-like scales with a lizard’s head, often wielding his terrible two-handed sword, Bloodsong, which is his emblem. He has 20 Aspects.

## Ksárul

Ancient Lord of Secrets, Doomed Prince of the Blue Room, Master of Magic and Sorcery.

![[ksarul.webp]]

Ksárul seeks knowledge, like Thúmis, but for the Doomed Prince wisdom has no meaning in the abstract, nor is it to be used for the benefit of society. Knowledge is power, and power is the individual’s greatest instinctive goal. Indeed, if a society is to exist at all it must be for reasons of individual aggrandisement, and the ultimate final ‘good’ is the victory of Ksárul. His godhead must continue even after the Final Change to be wrought by Hrü'ǘ. Magic, science, technology, and wisdom are all means to this end.

He aids those who would learn forbidden secrets, those who would contact the dwellers on other Planes, seekers of knowledge, and those who would serve him against the forces of Stability.

Ksárul is shown as a young man of slender build with a smiling, yet emotionless face, dressed in black velvet and carrying a staff topped by an azure beetle. His emblem is this same beetle over a pale crescent moon. He has 62 Aspects. Priests of Ksárul wear black robes, smiling masks of silver, and squarish mortarboard-shaped headdresses of black velvet. His priestesses are similarly attired, but their masks are of black wood for doctrinal reasons.

**Power Centres**

Ksárul is venerated especially in the cities of Púrdimal and Mrelú in Tsolyánu.

**Factions**

His temple has three major factions: the dreaded Ndálu Clan, which seeks power through political intrigue; the Society of the Blue Light, which gathers knowledge for its personal and collective power; and the Reflugent Blue Curtain Society, which keeps its wisdom secret until it can be used to return Ksárul to supreme authority over the Gods.

### Grugánu, Cohort of Ksárul

The Cohort of Ksárul is Grugánu: Knower of Spells, Black Sword of Doom, and Reader of the Incantations of the Dark. He combs the Planes for knowledge and sorcery which may aid his Lord, and aids Ksárul’s followers in their own quests. He is shown as a hulking anthropoidal half-human figure concealed in black draperies, and with a head like a small buzzard or serpent. His emblem is an open hand with claw-like fingers outspread to seize or strike. He has 27 Aspects.

## Dlamélish

Goddess of Hedonism, Green-Eyed Lady of Fleshy Joys, Mistress of Demons, and Obsidian Princess of the Damned.

![[dlamelish.webp]]

In many ways this Goddess is the antithesis of Sárku. She seeks the existential reality of the Now—changes as they occur at every moment, and the pleasures and pains of sense perception. She desires to attain the heights of ecstasy, the depths of sensuality, and the purely egotistic joy of perceived experience. She is the ultimate hedonist who cares nothing for others or for the ‘good’ of society. Only the self matters, and although she follows Hrü'ǘ in seeking ultimate Change, yet she must savour every moment along the way.

She aids those who seek sensual pleasure and immediate gratification, those who engage in her orgies and her ceremonies in the service of the Demons of the Dark, and those who are hedonistic, selfish, and uncaring of others.

The depictions of Dlamélish are varied: a wanton maiden, an Aridáni warrioress glorying in the sensual pleasures of carnage, a bestial, obese human female with a head like a sort of monstrous crocodile, etc. Her insignia consists of an emerald green drop falling into a silver oval. She has 101 Aspects, plus some others which are known only to the inner Circles of her temple, it is said. Her priestesses dress in revealing and lascivious robes of emerald green, wear tiaras of silver, and hang tiny silver bells from their wrists and ankles. Her priests defy description: dissolute youths, depraved old men, capering legions of the perverted, ox-like young men who serve at her orgies, etc., all in some variation of her emerald and silver livery.

**Power Centres**

Worshippers of Dlamélish are especially found all along the Mssúma River from above Béy Sü down to her great sanctuaries at Jakálla and Thráya.

**Factions**

Her temples are divided into several small factions: some are devoted to her rituals and the service of the Demons (eg. the Order of Argent); others desire only to practice her hedonistic sensualism (eg. the Society of the Emerald Radiance); and a few (eg. the Society of the Emerald and Silver Crown) are activists who work with their counterparts in the other temples of the Change—or even with Avánthe’s Girdle of Purity Society.

### Hriháyal, Cohort of Dlamélish

The Cohort of Dlamélish is Hriháyal : the Dancing Maiden of Temptation, Harlot of the Five Worlds and Mistress of the Thirty-Two Unspeakable Acts. She is the supreme orgiast, patroness of the ancient Mysteries which date back to Bednálljan times, and patroness of gambling. She is pictured as a voluptuous dancing maiden holding a curved dagger; her emblem is a vertical silver oval with a wavy emerald line drawn horizontally through it. She has 34 known Aspects, and perhaps several more venerated by her Inner Temple.

## Sárku

God of Death, the Five-Headed Lord of Worms, Master of the Undead, Guide into Darkness, the Demon-Lord of Decay.

Sárku seeks a slower, colder winding down in Hrü'ǘ’s final Nullity: the low and certain transition of life and death. To the Worm-Lord, life is but a brief orgasmic spasm before the long, dusty eternity of the tomb. Yet life and death are only two aspects of the same being, and the latter is the more perfect because it endures. The one condition of Sárku’s faith is the survival of the conscious intellect—the ego—which must continue to live and have awareness even in the sepulchre. The other demands of the body do not persist after death, but if the intellect has cognition throughout all eternity, it can witness and savour the final victory of the Dark.

![[sarku.webp]]

His realm is the necropolis, and there he aids those who serve his undead legions, those who worship the intellect and care little for the needs of the body, and those who send the living down to him in the unutterable stillness of death.

Sárku is represented as a mighty serpentine form having five vermiform heads, each with a gaping, suckered maw. A mass of coiling tentacles hangs beneath each head, and these bear some symbol of the grave: bones, rotted cerements, skulls, and corpse-candles. His emblem is a wavy black or copper line (Sárku loves copper and dislikes iron) with a red circle at one end, signifying the Eternal Victory of the Worm. He has 108 Aspects. His priests and priestesses wear earth-brown robes, whitened armour (females don a bodice of grave-hued cloth), and headdresses of skulls. His clergy (and also his ordinary worshippers on festival days) also paint their faces with white pigment in the form of grinning skulls.

**Power Centres**

In Tsolyánu, Sárku is almost sole master of the Kraá hills and the City of Sárku. He is also patron deity of the Ito family of the Chakas, and he has lesser centres in Sokátis, Jaikalór, and in Urmish.

**Factions**

Sárku’s priesthood is split between the Copper Tomb Society, another ally of the Ndálu Clan, and the Brotherhood of the Victory of the Worm, which cares little for this world and devotes itself to the rituals of the catacombs.

### Durritlámish, Cohort of Sárku

The Cohort of Sárku is Durritlámish: the Black Angel of the Putrescent Hand, Opener of Catacombs. He marshals the undead, and is depicted as a rotted corpse seated upon a throne of bones, holding a bowl in one hand from which smoke rises. His emblem is a stylised image of this bowl, the Vessel of the Vision of the World in which all the Skeins of Destiny of every creature in the universe may be seen. He has 16 aspects.

## Pariah Deities

Whose aim is to destroy all existence.

### She Who Must Not Be Named

### The One

### The One Other

_Tsolyánu’s_ religion is comprised of a pantheon of twenty gods of virtually equal power. Supposedly, they govern all reality, but there are hints that The One Other is the equal of all of them put together.

It is a mysterious entity whose nature is utterly foreign to the fabric of reality (at least, that is the official narrative). As explained elsewhere, the religion that dominates all of Tsolyánu states that the universe is overseen by two ‘families’ of gods, the Tlomítlanyal (the Lords of Glory), which is opposed by the Tlokìri-qáluyal (the Masters of Shadow). The foundational scriptures of the religion, however, mention a single further deity who appears to assist nine of the gods in restraining the rebellious tenth, Ksárul. This extra deity is The One Other.

## The Shadow Gods – The Religion of Livyánu

As their name implies, the gods of Livyánu exist in a shadowy grey area between good and evil; each god has both pleasant/noble and violent/frightening aspects balanced against one another.

The Livyáni are rumoured also to worship, as gods, demons such as Kurritlanéb, Origób, and The Beast without a Tail, and to even worship Pariah Gods.

### Qame’él

Chief of the Pantheon, a civic cult of the Livyáni noble classes, worshipped by nobles throughout Livyánu, apparently a god of civilisation, law, religious law, monumental architecture, etc., thus similar to Hŕsh in Mu’ugalavyá.

### The Shadowed One

God of Creation, Hnálla and Hru’ú combined, worshipped throughout Livyánu.

### Kirrinéb

Goddess of Ancestors, Provenance and Temple; a combination of Avánthe and Dlamélish, thus very similar to Shirringgáyi of Salarvyá.

### Ru’ungkáno

God of War, but more than simply Karakán and Vimúhla combined.

### The Horned One of Secrets

God of Culture and Knowledge, similar to a combination of Thúmis and Ksárul.

### Ndárka

God of Death and the Afterlife, thus akin to a combination of Belkhánu and Sárku.

### Vrusæmáz

God of Preservation, similar to the gods Trekhúish in Mu’ugalavyá and Wurú.

### The Sea Goddess of Karkársha

Goddess of fertility and female concerns; therefore most like an amalgamation of Dilinála and Hriháyal.

### Guodái

God of Men’s concerns (Honour, athletic ability, weapon skill, sexuality), so somewhat like a blend of Chegárra and Chiténg.

### Kikumársha

God of Healing and Hurting (through disease), thus somewhat of a synthesis of Keténgku and Grugánu.

### The Lost One of the Sea

God of those who have died at sea or whose bodies have not been recovered by their Temple (therefore without proper burial rites); distantly a combination of Qón and Durritlámish.

### Quyó

A Nature Goddess of the Tláshte Heights, responsible also for all uncivilised peoples, tribal cultures, and the insane, clanless, very poor, and imprisoned.

Perhaps, the same as Quyéla, an Aspect of Avanthé.

## Yán Koryáni Religion

### The Overlords

Ghól vs Grü’óth

### The Lords of Power

Dhárm and Búlkh vs Kshór and Súr

### Minor Lords of the Hearth

Thmárr Mrágghu Miyǽn Paía Kéreshm Tomúa Chrgál Khǘr Ó

## Demons

Termed a demon, but in Empire of the Petal Throne that means much more than some fiend from hell.

### Llyánmàkchi

A creature of legend, a lady of the demon realms. Mistress of a cluster of Planes of Existence, Llyánmàkchi controls the Tsúghiyur, the Ones Who Writhe and the Dwellers in Shadow. She serves no deity, and responds to the summons of good as well as evil sorcerers. Her concerns are beyond such things; she is not a devil or monster, nor a saint or celestial. She is ancient, calculating, cold, and unutterably alien.

## Undying Wizards

### Sarvodáya Di'éya

_Sarvodáya Di‛éla_ is whimsical and given to sudden mood swings, but her awareness extends across many Planes and she may be very justified in behaving the way she does.

She belongs to a convocation of archmages at the College at the End of Time. There, the palace of Avanthár stands under a great red sun and opens its doors to men, women, and others from across the Planes who’ve travelled from afar to discuss the issues affecting world's, clusters of worlds, and entire universes. Gorgeous but hot-tempered Sarvodáya walks with the lesser gods, but retains her human touch. She is a cruel and exacting mentor, but she does care for her wards.

## Hlutrgú

![[hlutrgu.webp]]

Portrait of an Hlutrgú from the sketchbook of Ilánish Chárea, of the Crimson Sphere clan.

Illustration Copyright ©1999

[http://tekumel.com/pic_nonhumans03.html](http://tekumel.com/pic_nonhumans03.html)

The violently inimical little Hlutrgú are one of mankind’s most implacable foes, fighting with vicious fanaticism in battle and torturing any captives in ways too ghastly to describe. Although they prefer the isolation of their bogs, they occasionally venture forth to raid human villages or harass local shipping from small coracles of skin. Were it not for the terrible losses which an army would suffer and the difficulty of invading their tidal swamps, the Tsolyáni might have exterminated them all long ago.

**Physical Attributes**

Tough, rubbery, and totally hairless, the Hlutrgú have a rotund body, four limbs each equipped with a usable hand with six fingers, and a skull-like head, the mouth filled with needle-sharp fangs. They are mottled greenish, greyish or blackish in colour, and range from 1.23 to 1.71 m in height. They have three sexes: males (95 percent), female spawners (4 percent), and asexual ‘leaders’ (about 1 percent).

**Enclaves**

Isolated bogs in the Kaija Protectorate.

## Hlüss

The insectoid Hlüss are indigenous to Tékumel. They are friendly to the Ssú and sometimes to the Shunned Ones, and neutral to the Hláka when the latter are not accompanied by humans. They love to set gems all over their bodies in intricate and beautiful patterns in a cement-like substance which they secrete. A mighty Hlüss warrior makes for a fearsome and magnificent spectacle indeed.

Though preferring to dwell on their lonely island, the Hlüss are inquisitive and greedy for magical devices and weapons, and occasionally sail forth in their hive-like ships (made of the same bodily secretion) to seek items of interest and food for their young. Each nest-ship and each settlement contain at least one of their huge breeder-females—the ‘Hluss-Mother’. The young are brought forth in sac-like eggs and are inserted into a paralyzed living host (who dies an agonising death), where they remain for about 125 days before emerging. The Hlüss can be detected at sea by their constant buzzing, humming sound, and on land their acidic, sweetish odour may be smelled at a distance of 30-40m. There are three sexes: the male fertilizers (5 percent), the female egg-layers (2 percent), and the neuter worker-fighters (93 percent).

**Physical Attributes**

The Hlüss possess a long, segmented, scorpion-like body, four high-arched legs, a prehensile tail fitted with a paralysing sting, two smaller forearms ending in three digits and a thumb, and a broad, flattish head with three eyes and a sharp proboscis above a set of razor-sharp mandibles. They are covered with a light, chitinous exoskeleton and are greenish blue to shiny black in colour. They normally remain on all fours, but may rear up and use their central pair of ‘hands’ as tearing weapons in battle, though they do not employ swords or other weapons with these limbs. They range from 1.22 to 1.62m high on four legs, gaining perhaps another metre when they rear up.

**Enclaves**

The island of Hlüssuyal.

## Mihálli

“... some creature out of an ancient bestiary, furred all over, a snarling animal muzzle rimmed with up-curving fangs, pointed ears like those of a Renyu, two arms that were over-long, jointed in places where no human—or Pé Chói—had joints. Then the edges of the beast’s image sparkled, faded, and solidified into other features ...”

from The Man of Gold by M.A.R. Barker, ©1984 DAW Books

The Mihálli are gifted with great sorcerous and interdimensional powers, and it is said that they may even exist on more than one plane at once. Their motives seem unintelligible, for at one moment they may be friendly and helpful, at the next they may be hostile, and at the next they may simply disappear. They are so rare as to have become almost mythological on Tékumel—in fact they prefer to remain aloof from human affairs.

**Physical Attributes**

The alien Mihálli are essentially man-like, though with five fingers and a thumb on each hand and six breasts, and the head is reminiscent of a great cat with up-pointed ears and large opalescent red eyes. They are slender, and range from dull green—the lower caste warriors—to reddish brown—the leaders. The Mihálli have the ability to change shape; adopting the appearance of another being of comparable size, though if the imitated being has more than four limbs (or a prehensile tail), these would appear to be paralysed. Moreover their eyes remain a gleaming red despite their disguise. It is the thought that the species is hermaphroditic, but their reproductive processes are largely unknown.

**Enclaves**

Unknown. This race is not to be confused with the modern human inhabitants of Mihállu, their ancient homeland.

## Nyaggá

The Nyaggá are an aquatic race that remain aloof and generally do not bother human shipping, though they have been known to come ashore for infrequent and brief nocturnal raids. Dead specimens have shown that they are essentially mammalian, and there are rumours that the Nyaggá can interbreed with humans—as witness the vestigal gills and pallid appearance of the folk living around the cities of Ngaku and Prajnu. However they cannot—or do not—communicate with man and react hostilely to incursions into their watery domains.

**Physical Attributes**

The body of the Nyaggá is a long, tapering cylinder some 3m in length, without fins or scales, a sickly grey-white in colour, and ending in an eel-like tail. The head is round and bulbous, soft and segmented like a human brain. A central black-lipped mouth is surrounded by a ring of six great jet-black eyes. Six long retractable tentacles covered with tiny suckers and cilia, which serve for hands, emerge from a ring of muscle at the juncture of the body and the head. Totally extended, the Nyaggá is about 5m long. In water they swim with a sinuous quickness, while on land they pull themselves along with their tentacles in combination with a coiling of their bodies. Their reproductive processes are unknown.

**Enclaves**

Beneath the waters of Lake Parunal to the east of Yán Kór and Sa’á Allaqí.

## Shunned Ones

Tsolyáni: Vleshgayal; Yán Koryáni: Blashagh)

These hideous, gangling beings are totally inimical to mankind and his allies; mighty sorcerors who in small parties search the ruins and labyrinths of ancient Tékumel for magical devices and equipment. Very little is known about their society, for their sealed domed cities keep in their own noxious atmosphere; a corrosive, yellowish gas that renders humans incapacitated after 30 minutes and kills within another 45 minutes at most.

**Physical Attributes**

The Shunned Ones are humanoid, very tall (from 1.85 to 2.33m), with extremely long, bony limbs. The face is puckered and wrinkled like rotting fruit and has only a pair of round, black, pupiless eyes for features. The mouth is hidden in a mass of wrinkles at the base of the throat. They wrap themselves in voluminous, flapping robes of dust-brown or night-black. Their worst feature, however, is their terrible and repellent stench, which can be detected at a range of as much as 60m! Specimens possess at least five types of organs which may be reproductive in function—these may represent different sexes, or they may be developmental stages in the life-cycle of one sex.

**Enclaves**

Sealed domed cities in the barren plains of Yán Kór.

## Ssú

“Four wide-spraddled legs extended out from the twisted column of the torso ... The head was oval, the face only vaguely human; there were two eyes, round and black-gleaming, and nostril slits but no nose. The mouth consisted of a vertical ellipse. It was the thing’s skin that was the most repellent: it resembled mottled gray parchment peeling from a roll, the ends loose and ragged, very much like the winding sheet of a corpse long in the grave.”

Portrait of a Black Ssú from the sketchbook of Ilánish Chárea, of the Crimson Sphere clan.

-Illustration Copyright ©1999

The ancient Ssú were once masters of the land masses of Tékumel, while their cousins the Hlüss ranged the coasts and the seas. They hate mankind for destroying the original form of their world. There are two sub-species: the Grey Ssú, and the larger Black Ssú. Both species are excellent magic-users, and they also possess a limited hypnotic ability which can immobilise human warriors or cause them to turn and fight their friends.

**Physical Attributes**

Though differing in height (the Grey Ssú are between 1.71 and 1.90m in height, the Black between 1.83 and 2.41m), both varieties of Ssú are similar in appearance: a central torso set upon a narrow abdomen from which extend four equidistant legs. There are two upper arms ending in three digited hands (the largest ‘finger’ functions as a thumb), but they sometimes rear up on their back legs to fight, using their middle limbs to hold a shield or another weapon. The head has two eyes, nostril slits, and a mouth shaped like a vertical oval. Their outer integument is wrapped around their limbs like paper on a roll, and the loose ends of this ‘skin’ keep pulling off in fragments, making the Ssú look like a tattered mummy. The Ssú smell rather like musty cinnamon, and their language sounds like a sweet, high chiming, rippling up and down the scale like a chorus of little bells. They have three sexes: males (15 percent), females (5 percent), and neuter worker-fighters (80 percent).

**Enclaves**

The Grey Ssú dwell just north of Salarvya and Pechano, while the Black Ssú are found on a biggish island far off in the western ocean. There are also enclaves on Tékumel's other continents. They yearn to retake their ancient stronghold of Ssúganar, now in Pecháno.

## Urunén

The Urunén have only recently come into contact with the inhabitants of the northern continent; therefore not much is known about them. Their society is homogenous, complex, and inward-looking; they are good scholars and exhibit psychic talents on a par with those of mankind. The Urunén have shown an ability to dissemble and play at diplomacy, and is likely that their cleverness will make them difficult allies and dangerous foes.

**Physical Attributes**

A little taller than mankind (from 1.45 to 1.93m) and quite humanoid in appearance, the Urunén have a muscular body covered with brownish, velvet-like fur, and possess a long tail. The head is rather alien however; long-snouted, triangular, like a cross between a serpent and some bovine animal. The eyes are set wide apart on each side of the head. There are two sexes: males (35 percent), and females (65 percent).

**Enclaves** The sub-polar regions around Tékumel’s south pole.

**Names**: Aiché, Arévi, Hú

This manual, written in the ancient Bednálljan of the Court of Queen Nayári, is titled, “The Book of the Unnamed God”.

# Technology, Techno-Magic, and Metal of the Ancients

## Techno-Magical Devices

There are many techno-magical devices that were created shortly after Techemel was moved into its pocket dimension. The most well known are ‘eyes’; little dice sized devices with an aperture on one side and a button on another side. About 50% have a built in counter letting the user know how many charges are left in the device.

## Ancient’s Technology

## Metal of the Ancients

Metal of the Ancients is more synthetic plastic than metal and does not affect spell casting.

Personality and Backgrounds

# Alignment

The standard nine alignments exists in Tékumel, but the people of this world are not concerned with the struggle between good and evil. Law (Stability) and Chaos (Change) are of far greater importance in this world. As well as Nobility of action determines how society looks at him. Integrity is far more important (if you say you're evil, act it). The worst villains in this world are hypocrites. The various societies on this world are Lawful Neutral with strong Neutral tendencies. However, true Neutrals are rare except among nonhumans and a person that does not align himself with the various powers and changes temple allegiance like the wind is a very dishonorable person (and will probably wind up poor paying all those temple donations).

Remember that citizens of the Five Empires are a great deal less concerned with "good" or "evil" than they are with "noble action". Just because priests of Vimúhla sacrifice humans daily on their great flaming altars doesn't mean that they aren't good company at dinner parties! Alignment on Tékumel is more a question of who you associate with and what ideals you strive for than a cosmic battle between the forces of Good and Evil.

# Education, Training, and Upbringing

A character's background is diverse and fundamental to the making of a character. It places you into the world and in many cases explains your skills and knowledge.

On Tékumel, the first part a background is figuring out what clan you belong to. Find out from the DM if your character is from a specific clan or level of clan (low, medium, high, etc) or clanless. There are many things you may be restricted from depending on your clan.

A person's background covered here consists of:

- Your Clan: Clans of Tsolyáni
- Your Faith: Temple Affiliation
- Your Career: Tsolyáni Career Paths
- Professional training: Professions and Clan Business

## Clans of Tsolyáni

**Clan and Lineage**

Tsolyánu is a stratified society which allows for little mixing between social classes. People from very different backgrounds would almost never become friends. Some walks of life, such as the army, do not segregate so rigidly. It would be possible for one young Heréksa (roughly "lieutenant") to befriend an infantryman in his command. But while a degree of camaraderie with the ranks would be acceptable, ultimately the Heréksa is the one calling the shots. The situation requires the other to be subservient.

The vast majority of people in Tsolyánu, Mu’ugalavyá, and Yán Kór belong to a clan, whose rules govern social and economic life. Clans are organized relatively simple compared to the complexity of Temples and Government, you’re born a Clan-Brother or Clan-Sister. Only ambitious charismatic, competent leaders, with a lifetime of service to the clan may be chosen by the clan-house to become a Clan-Elder.

Being elected as a Clan-Elder commonly also means you are devoted to the temple of the clan. If your clan-house is in the far north of the empire (closer toYán Kór), women are far more likely to being Clan-Elders, well men are more common in the south (not even senior Aridáni).

Traditions differ, but most clanhouse councils are 5-20 Clan-Elders, depending on the size of the clanhouse. They meet once a week to discuss things such as formulation of policies, the settlement of minor issues, allocate funds to projects and needs, etc. The council selects one member to serve as head of the clanhouse. Clan-Elders and Clan-Heads server for five years. A Clan-Head represents his clanhouse at regional and national meetings of the clan and to the councils in the Palace of the Realm, when needed. Some clans are powerful, others feeble and plebeian. Most clans boast several lineages, which vary in status.

People are bonded by belonging to the same clan. Regardless of lineage, members of a clan give mutual trust, aid and comradeship. Someone of low lineage are "poor country cousins" who must be appropriately courteous to their more prestigious urban relatives, but this relationship is sufficiently close to be tenable.

Clans are generally collections of families of a similar faith and trade. This varies from clan-to-clan, with the more powerful clans holding more strictly to their identities (the Golden Bough clan, for instance, is a conservative Stability clan, meaning its members are generally Hnálla, Thúmis or Avánthe worshippers of high status), while the lower clans are less rigid: the Black Mat clan which weaves sleeping mats, for instance. There are members of the Golden Bough clan who have gone on to worship the Change gods Chiténg or Hrihiyal, but they are definitely "black sheep" (or "black hma" as the case may be). The Black Mat clan has no time for such niceties: "Just weave yer accursed mat and shut up!"

Some clans are "religious clans" (Cloak of Azure Gems), while others are "professional clans" -- various mercantile clans pay only lip-service to a religious faith. And again, the richer you are, the better a show you have to put on. The poorer you are, the less anyone cares.

Tsolyánu has over 1500 recognized clans.

**Joining a Clan**

Foreigners can be offered membership into a clan, The person(s) would need to hold true to the clans values and interest, plus pay a handsome fee to join. 1000-6000 káitars for joining a Very Low or Low clan; 7000-12000 to join a Medium clan; 25000-45000 to join a High clan. To join a Very High Clan you would need the sponsorship of an Imperial Prince or Emperor. If you are a part of a clan and wish to advance yourself into a higher clan, you would need to pay substantially more (1.5-2 times more) as you also must compensate your current clan for leaving.

### The CLANLESS

People without a clan are at the bottom of the heap in Tsolyáni society. Well off foreigners can receive a certain amount of respect, but foreigners and other clanless people are worth less than slaves and are treated accordingly.

### IMPERIAL: The Tlakotani

|**Tlakotani**|The clan to which the Tsolyáni royal family belongs; some well-to-do farmers and middle-class urban merchants are members as well; found around Béy Sü, Hauma, and Usenanu. People are born into the Tlakotani, you cannot bribe or even marry into the imperial clan.|

# Faith: Temple Affiliation ([[#^[1]]]|Comment #[ 1]])

Every Tsolyáni is a part of one of the twenty temples, each dedicated to a sect of the pantheon of gods. The gods are real, with occasional manifestations and interactions with the lesser beings; there are no atheists or even agnostics. The people the Five Empires spend a good deal of time daily with their temples, rituals, and doctrines of faith.

It is most common to follow the god or cohort that your clan follows, but is not required.

**Gods of Stability**

Hnálla: Lord of light

Avánthe: Mother goddess

Karakán: God of war

Thúmis: God of knowledge

Belkhánu: God of afterlife

**Gods of Change**

Hrü’ü : Lord of darkness

Dlamélish: Goddess of hedonism

Vimúhla : God of fire

Ksárul : God of secrets

Sárku : God of death

# Tsolyáni Career Paths

## Life in the Temple

After joining a temple and attending to your duties after about a year and attaining your First Circle, the new acolyte must pick a branch of the temple to enter: Administrative, Ritual, Scholar, Temple Guard\ Warrior-Priests, or Lay-Priests.Changing branches is very rare and it’s more common for someone to switch from being in a very active role to becoming a Lay-Priest to pursue their own interests, however switching to Lay-Priest is a one way decision.

Clan status shapes a priest's responsibilities. High-clan clergy ended up involved in rituals sooner than Lower-clan, perhaps holding the holy scrolls for the ritual Priests, or singing in the antiphonal choirs. Lower-clan’s commonly work in libraries, as scholars, do the accounting for the temple in offices, or greet and guide visitors to the shrines of Aspects.

It is very rare for anyone to retire from the priesthood - usually this would only be due to ill health, political disfavour or the pressure of clan interests. Since most priestly careers are very limiting on freedom, players who dislike a tight rein should opt for the relative latitude given to Lay-Priests. Otherwise you must expect only to go on adventures that are assigned by your superiors.

### Ritual Priests

(commonly any magic-using class)

The Ritual branch of a temple is responsible for performing all the temples rituals, as well as public speaking on theology and orthodoxy (which Scholars would have prepared). Ritual Priests start out as assistants to senior priests, holding books and censers, singing in choirs. As acolytes learn more they get more responsibility and duties with greater visibility; performing sacrifices and other rites, to eventually become the senior celebrant in the temples elaborate rituals, the public ones as well as the secret and dangerous ones.

### Scholar-Priests

(commonly any magic-using class)

The scholarly branch of a temple is responsible for advancing the knowledge in any field the temple values. Starting as instructors for children's classes under the watch of their predecessors until a senior Priest is satisfied, then moving upwards is education and study, to eventually be contributing to the studies and research of senior Scholars, and then working on their own works. Scholars commonly must write a thesis or other articles of knowledge to justify their circle advancement at each circle.

Many magic-users are Scholar-Priests who specialise in the study of magic.

### Administrative Priests

(Any Class)

The administrative branch handles all day to day operations of running the temple, supervising servants and slaves, administrate over properties and temple resources, handle any logistics and so forth. Senior administrative Priests control great resources and political influence that shape a temples strategies.

### Lay-Priests

(Any Class)

Lay-Priests are not a part of temple hierarchies, as they receive their training in the theology of their deity and any other subject, then earn a living outside of the temples. They have access to their temples libraries and teacher, as well as being able to stay in the temple dormitories when needed, but the temple does not support them or give them specific duties.

Lay-Priests tend to be scholars, physicians, magicians, or a part of other noble profession. They sell their skills, hire out as house Preist, work for a senior Lay-Priest, magical bodyguards, or specialist. Magicians attached to legions in support roles are commonly Lay-Priests, but Military Magicians who do battle magic are not.

### Warrior-Priests & Guards

(Any Martial Weapon specialty class)

Temple guards and warriors are the security for temples, whose duties include routine guard duties, escorting senior priests, crowd control at public rituals, etc. The career path of a temple guard is very similar to that of a legionary.

War temples such as Karakán and Chegárra, Vimúhla, and Chiténg, tend to promote their guards to temple-sponsored legions, while injured and retired legionaries rotate back to serve as temple guards.

## The Military

The Five Empires keep highly organized standing armies, so legion members need Military Rank. See Circle and Renown to find rank and title within the military.

Anyone who went on to join a legion will just be completing their five year enlistment period at age 20. During this time the character will have received basic training. After their enlistment period, people can either re-enlist or they can make use of their military training for personal gain by becoming a bodyguard, gladiator or adventurer.

Heavy Infantry

Medium Infantry/ Marine

Light Infantry or Archers

The weapons learned are those used by the legion, which varies by legion. Members of temple-run legions will be priestly Acolytes at least.

Marines should be treated as medium infantry except that they are more sailor than soldier.

Other military or paramilitary units include sappers, artillery, Sákbe road guards, tomb police, city militia and prison guards. These units lack glory and prestige.

A tirrikámu (sergeant) commands a semétl or squad of 20 soldiers. A heréksa (Lieutenant) leads a karéng or company of 100 soldiers, and a Kási (Captain) commands a tsurúm or cohort of 400 soldiers. A niqómi or legion is composed of 20 cohorts (8000). Each legion has two molkár (majors) who command the left and right wings of the legion in battle, and two dritlán (colonels) who assist the kérdu (general) as his staff.

## The Imperial Bureaucracy Civil Service

The life of a bureaucrat need not be as tedious as it sounds. There are few opportunities for derring-do, admittedly, but it’s an ideal basis for stratagems and intrigues.

Any literate character of high clan can become a bureaucrat. In Tsolyánu, this is a position within one of the Four Palaces of the Empire:

- the Palace of the Realm (government bureaucracy)
- the Palace of Ever-Glorious War (military bureaucracy)
- the Palace of the Priesthood of the Gods (religious bureaucracy)
- the Palace of Foreign Lands (diplomatic bureaucracy).

A bureaucrat can expect to rise in the hierarchy until he reaches a Circle equivalent to his social status. To progress beyond this point he will need ability, luck, wealth (for lavish gifts to his superiors), the right political connections, and talent for intrigue. Good looks also help, this being a quality much admired by the Tsolyáni.

The clans that dominate the most senior positions (XIVth Circle and up) locally are Sea Blue, Golden Sunburst, Golden Bough, and Jade Diadem.

The clans most widespread in the upper hierarchy (IXth through XIIIth Circles) are White Crystal, Purple Gem, Standing Stone, and Joyous of Vra.

The clans with most members in the middle positions (IVth through VIIIth Circle) are Blue Kirtle, Black Stone, Scroll of Wisdom, Iron Plume and Victorious Globe.

The clans figuring prominently in the lower echelons (up to IIIrd Circle) are Plume of White, Sunlit Dome and High Tower.

### The Palace of the Realm

[http://www.Tékumel.com/eoasw3_04.html](http://www.tekumel.com/eoasw3_04.html)

The Palace of the Realm of the Glorious and Ever-living God King, Master of the Many Universes and Emperor of All, is one of the four departments of the Tsolyáni civil service, It is responsible for all domestic affairs including taxation, law enforcement, land ownership, records and public works. There is a branch of the Palace of the Realm in every town. The Palace in Jakálla comprises a vast complex of buildings situated on the south bank of the Equ’noyel River, below the Governor’s Palace.

#### The Eight Departments of The Palace of the Realm

**The Department of Domestic Affairs**

It includes these sub departments:

- **The Registry of Births, Marriages and Deaths**

a natural contraceptive, lisutl root, was genetically engineered by the original colonists of Tékumel, is used and keeps birth rates within limit.

- **The Registry of Aridani Declarations**

Here women may come to declare themselves legally independent. The woman is then Aridani, meaning that she has all the legal rights and responsibilities of a man. Aridani status is necessary for any woman who wishes to carry on a career outside her clan—eg, in the priesthood, army or bureaucracy.

- **The Registry of Conferral of Citizenship and Rights to Permanent Residence**
- **The Registry of Malefactors**

This maintains a partial list of known or suspected wrongdoers. Others are kept by the Department of the Seven Commissioners, the Marble Mansion of Metlunel I, the Palace of Ever-Glorious War, and the Omnipotent Azure Legion.

**The Department of the Seven Commissioners**

- **Tax affairs**

sub-department comprises the _Office of Assessment of Clan Worth_, the _Office of Collation of Revenue Reports_ (which maintains a network of spies and informers) and the _Office for the Organization of Tax Collection_ (which employs gangs of former legionaries to scour the countryside).

- **The Imperial Mint**

is charged with minting and distribution of coins and the prevention of counterfeiting.

- **The Stamping Office**

Marks weights and measures for use in the marketplace, etc, to show that they have been verified by Imperial officials. Falsification of such a stamp is an Imperial crime, though in fact the cost and time rquired to get weights checked deters most merchants (even the honest ones) from bothering to get this done.

- **The Provincial Treasury**

This might look like a lure to thieves, but it is well-guarded by a crack contingent of the militia and is also reputed to have sorcerous wards.

**The Marble Mansion of Metlunel I**

- **The Imperial Courts**, comprising the Court of Ten Pillars, the Court of Delegates and the Court of Thirteen Pillars.
- **The Civil Courts**, comprising the First and Third Appellate Courts, the Court of the Brazen Dais and the Court of Pleadings.
- **The Office of Interrogation** is operated by members of the Clan of the Edification of the Soul. This is a small tightly-knit clan of low social prestige but great importance in legal matters because its members are traditionally the only people (other than officers of the Omnipotent Azure Legion) who are able to apply judicial torture. A Mri (literally "Quartet") of four orange-robed members of the clan, each wearing the lizard-like mask of the god Chiténg, must be present at any torture or public execution.
- **The Gallery of Expectation** contains cells for those undergoing trial. (Some of these "cells" can be quite luxurious if one gives the police guards a large enough bribe.)
- **The Office of Debt Reclaimation** is where a person found guilty of bankruptcy will be held while his clan is given the chance to pay his debts. If this is not done within a few weeks, the unfortunate bankrupt is handed over to the slaver’s clan for sale, and the proceeds are disbursed to his creditors.

**The Department of the Third Courtyard**

- **The Office of Marketplaces**. This office is responsible for issueing trading permits (but not customs or foreign trade) and appoints market magistrates. It maintains close liaison with the market police.
- **The Registry of Slaves** keeps track of all slaves passing through the slave market. You’ve arrived in town to find your gambling addicted cousin has gone missing? Here’s the place to start the search—as long as you’re prepared to wade through several hundred scrolls’ worth of documentation!

**The Department of Agency and Exertion**

- **The Battalions of the Province**. The militia are drilled as medium infantry, but are unlikely to see battle unless civil war should break out. More often their duties are to act as police (including market police, but not prison or tomb guards), fire wardens and nightwatchmen.
- **The Supervisorship of the Arena** deals mainly with Imperial ceremonies to be held at the Hililakte. These are held to celebrate military victories and are useful in creating a sense of national unity which is not a natural part of the Tsolyáni psyche. Other impromptu entertainments may be needed to distract a restless populace, and it is important to move quickly on such occasions.
- **The Office of Imperial Benevolence** contracts civic work out to the clans—for example, the recent renovation of the abandoned temple of the Unknown One.
- **The Office of Imperial Puissance** deals with the rental of state resources and also (more often) the co-option of labour for huge projects such as the erection of Imperial monuments or the rebuilding of a city through Ditlana ("renewal"). In theory all property belongs to the Imperium and it has the right to co opt labour without payment. In practice only about 30% of the economy is directly controlled and administered by the state, and "compulsory" labour has to be paid for by favours and behind-the-scenes agreements with the chiefs of the clans.
- **The Colonnade of Illumination** sees to the hiring of scholars (usually lay-priests of the various temples) as expert advisors, who are then assigned to department as needed.

**The Department of Accession and Embarkation**

- **The Collectorship of Gate Tolls** supervises the issuance of travel permits. (It is necessary to have an official document stating your clan if you travel outside your home city. This can be had for about 2 Kaitars. You might have to wait a week or two.) This office sees to the levying of tolls, not just at the main city gates but at certain bridges and by-ways of historical privilege.
- **The Office of Harbour Maintenance** oversees maritime matters in the Equ’noyel and MiSsúma estuaries, being responsible for the harbour defences, port security, and the proclamation of storm warnings. (For the last of these, a priest of Karakán is always on hand to cast divinations.)

**The Hallway of the Twelve Columns**

- **the Office of Maintenance of the Roads**
- **the Office of Maintenance of the City Walls**
- **the Office of Maintenance of the Prisons**

**The Department of the City of Lasting Repose**

- **The Office for the Erection of Tombs and Monuments**, which evaluates the cost of works decreed by Avanthar and then passes on its requirements to the Department of Agency and Exertion.
- **The Office for the Recovery of Stolen Materials** has charge of a unit of the city militia whose special responsibility is the tracing of items stolen from the nobility or from the Imperium itself. Items stolen from tombs are not within this office’s purview, falling instead under the jurisdiction of the tomb police.

## The Omnipotent Azure Legion

The offices of the Omnipotent Azure Legion (OAL) are commonly situated within the Governor’s Palace itself, north of the Palace of the Realm. Officers of the intelligence arm of the Legion deal with matters of the highest state security: treason, zu’ur smuggling, espionage, diabolism, mutiny and rioting. This department also keeps a close watch on bureaucrats and police. As OAL Captain Arodai hiNaqumar says: "Who watches the watchmen? We do, pal, and don’t you forget it!"

## The Profession of the Clan

Characters who do not join one of the three institutions of Priesthood, Military or Imperial Bureaucracy continue to work at home with their clan. For most this means learning a profession that will benefit the clan, either by directly joining the clan’s traditional occupation or by administering the clan finances. Noble clans employ subservient clans for procedures such as accounting, and an idle member of such a clan can use his private income to sponsor a life of hunts, banquets and hobbies.

# Professions and Clan Business

## The Pen and the Sword

Cultural preconceptions tend to channel an individual’s learning into specific skill-groupings. Additionally, personal preference encourages the archetypal dichotomy of academic versus practical skills: “men of deliberation” as opposed to “men of action”. As a general rule, Tsolyáni nobles tend to affect an aristocratic disdain for scholarship, while the lower classes rarely get the opportunity for advanced education. Scholars will usually be of middle clan, therefore, leaving the high and low clans to make up the bulk of the soldiery.

The following is a list of professions and talents that characters could have learned as part of their lives growing up within their families, clans, or temples. These should be incorporated among a character's chosen skills and are for background only. The professions are mentioned to be either:

- _Plebeian_: skills of ordinary craftsmen and artisans.
- _Skilled_: skills crafts requiring greater study and experience.
- _Noble_: skills requiring considerable study and work. The acquisition of these skills is usually restricted to children of nobility, and the priest-schools.

|---|---|

#### Expert\Artisan

An Expert may focus on any one or several of the skills, depending on his or her role within society. Intelligence is the most common, particularly for craftsmen, bureaucrats, administrative priests, artists, jurists, scholars and scribes.

**Alchemist**

_Noble_ (Herbalism & Poisoner’s kit)

Practical and theoretical knowledge of drugs, poisons, medicines, antidotes and aphrodisiacs. The compounds which the character is able to prepare will depend on the local availability of ingredients as well as on apparatus, time, and skill-level. This skill permits very little in the way of research or deviation from the hoary pharmacopeia of the ancients.

**_Artis\Jeweller_**: Art objects and other things of beauty are highly valued throughout the Empire of the Petal Throne, and a great artist can find renown as well as riches in providing that art.

Proficiency in creating and appraising works in a given artistic field. The form of art studied must be specified (it could be painting, sculpture, engraving, tapestry, etc)

**Astrologer**

noble

Like sorcery, this skill is normally taught in the temple academies and there is only a 10% chance of finding a private tutor. It includes knowledge of the sun, planets and moons (Tékumel’s pocket-cosmos contains no stars) and the ability to use an astrolabe, ephemerides, and other paraphernalia to construct horoscopes. This allows the astrologer to identify personality traits in a subject, compose synastric charts, give advice on auspicious times and enterprises, and so forth.

**Bureaucrat**: The Tsolyánu Empire is dependent on a vast number of bureaucrats to keep virtually every imaginable matter running smoothly, from administrative priest, mercantile taxes to the logistics of Sakbé road maintenance.

**_Chlén-Hide Smith-Tanner_**: Chlén-hide is used by members of all social classes and professions, and so an astute chlén-hide smith-tanner will happily make goods for whoever can pay his or her fee. Like most artisans, though, chlén-hide smith-tanners tend to attract customers appropriate to their own status, so that a Broken Reed smith-tanner will sell to a higher class of buyer than a High Tower smith-tanner.

**_Diplomat_**: Diplomats can come from a variety of backgrounds, but almost all are from high or very high clans. The Expert character class can cover both Tsolyáni and foreign diplomats. Note that diplomats are often given small, compact projectile weapons, sometimes even Eyes, with which to defend themselves while fleeing the area if need be.

**_Jurist_**: Tsolyáni law is frequently convoluted in application, particularly when Temple Law and other bye-laws are taken into account. Jurists and lawyers are an essential tool of both the Clans and the Temples in ensuring their own interests are served and their rivals’ plots thwarted.

**_Scholar or Scribe_**: Most scholars are also Priests, attached to one or another temple. Certain clans may also employ scholars for their own purposes, and of course the Imperial administration employs vast numbers of scribes.

**_Winemaker_**: Though there are no taverns on Tékumel, the winemakers’ clan buildings always include rooms and halls to rent out for private parties, and so a professional winemaker will often serve as host as well as manufacturing the drinks.

#### Entertainer

Entertainers always rely on personal interaction, even those whose entertainment work is also a cover for less socially approved activities. Depending on the Entertainer’s clan and the precise nature of his or her profession

**_Musician_**: Musicians are valued throughout Tékumel, with everyone from peasants to princes enjoying a good tune.

**Prostitute**: Prostitutes are found at all levels of Tsolyáni society, from the slave girls hired out by the lowest merchant caravan to high-clan sacred whores dedicated to Dlamélish. The prostitute learns to use his or her seductive ways and knowledge of others’ desires to influence them in more subtle ways. This can affect any heterosexual characters of the opposite sex to the prostitute, homosexual characters of the same sex, or bisexual characters of either sex.

**_Thief_**: Professional thieves are non-existent in Tsolyáni society. However, certain Entertainers supplement their legitimate income by a small amount of stealing, since their profession gives them many opportunities to plan and carry out theft (as well as to leave town afterwards without appearing any more suspicious than usual).

**_Poisoner_**: Entertainers are accused of being poisoners almost as often as they are of being thieves. In most cases neither accusation is accurate, but it is true that there are a few entertainers who will mix a deadly brew for a client unable to afford to go to one of the sanctioned Assassins’ Clans.

**_Ritual Priest_**_:_ Every temple recruits charismatic individuals to lead the faithful in worship. Ritual priests are not usually magicians or scholars, but instead devote their lives to bringing others to a greater understanding of their god through dramatic ritual.

#### Guard

Guards are employed by both Temples and Clans. Much of their time is taken up with acting as a security force for the relevant temple complex or clan-house, but as with any group that is effectively a private army, a Guard detachment may occasionally be sent on another mission at the behest of its masters. Many Temple or Clan guards also act as police forces within their assigned area; an example would be the Tomb Police in the service of Lord Sárku, who protect the necropolis of Bey Su.

Some of the more warlike Temples and Clans even form their Guards into legions in time of war. Though Guards are not quite so effective as regular Legionaries in this role, many of a Guard’s skills are certainly transferable to soldiering.

Guards are expert at spotting, and rapidly dealing with, threats of any kind. This includes raiding parties sent out by rival Temples or Clans, invading enemy armies, and occasionally an opportunist thief or two. The more experienced Guards are also trained as personal bodyguards for high-ranking Temple or Clan personnel.

Temple guards, as might be expected, get on very well with priests of their own temple, including ritual priests (Entertainers), scholar priests (Sorcerers), and administrative priests (Experts). Indeed, all Temple guards also receive minimal priestly training, becoming Priests of the 1st Circle or sometimes higher.

#### Labourer

Labourers are probably the most common profession in all of Tsolyánu. They can include peasants, miners, builders, and any other profession that relies on physical strength more than skill. Many slaves are Labourers, though slaves can also be members of most of the other character classes. Labourers work, usually with their hands.

#### Merchant

Travelling Merchants who anticipate long days traversing the Sakbé road system

_Slaver._

#### Scout

_Sailor, Hunter, Pioneer, Woodsman_

# Backgrounds

The following backgrounds from the Player’s Handbook (PHb) are appropriate for Tsolyani:

**Acolyte** (PHb127)

Variant: **Temple Guard**

You’ve become an elite guard that protects the interest and secrets of your faith.

**Charlatan** (PHb128)

Suited for spies and perhaps government officials who must always put on faces well dealing with the rigors of political life.

**Criminal** (PHb129)

Criminal organizations are unheard of and if discovered, they would be routed out at all levels by the empire. However, there is always suitable work in government offices and for spies.

**Entertainer** (PHb 130)

Variant: **Courtesan**

You know how to distribute pleasure to any who see you, be it with stimulating conversation or your practiced touch. Whether you worked for low or high clans, or as a pampered companion of nobility, you now find yourself outside of that pleasant environment.

**Feature: Cultured**

You can easily fit in among the nobility as you’ve spent a great amount of time learning about and dealing with them. When you become familiar with the local nobilities you find that although you do not possess their power, but you do have their ear.

**Folk Hero** (PHb 131)

Variant: **Folk Healer**

You have learned old folk remedies, and perhaps not all of them work but you understand the powers of positive thinking and giving your patience hope. You are proficient in Medicine in place of Survival and often know gardening, herb-lore, and bloodletting as specialties.

**Guild Artisan** (PHb 132)

**Hermit** (PHb 134)

**Noble** (PHb 135)

Variant: **Aristocrat**

You have lived a life of excess and luxury beyond others of noble birth, but with an equally hidden cost; Imperial Court which is as deadly, and at times bloodier, than a battlefield.

**Outsider** (PHb 136) You are considered a barbarian and are either clanless or a lost relative of a clan.

**Sage** (PHb 137)

You are noble and trained within a medium to high clan or within a temple. Choose either Arcana or Religion as your skill.

**Sailor** (PHb 139)

**Soldier** (PHb140)

Military Training: You were trained in the use of spears and the prefered weapon of your unit.

As a soldier you serve as a guard, city watch, sakbe road guard, temple guard for a legion or any number of positions within the soldier's life.

Variant: **Former Legionnaire**

You served in a temple or imperial legion. Choose or discuss some options with the DM as to what legion you were a part of and what privileges and rights that may grant you. Commonly contacts within your old legion as well as legion equipment (weapons and armour).

Variant: **Former Marine**

You were a part of the navy and spent a lot of your life battling at sea.

TooI Proficiencies: Instead of Vehicles (land) you gain proficiency in Vehicles (water).

The following backgrounds from the Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide (SCAG) are appropriate for Tsolyani:

**City Watch/ Investigator** (SCAG 145)

**Cloistered Scholar** (SCAG 146)

**Courtier** (SCAG 146)

**Faction Agent** (SCAG 147)

**Inheritor** (SCAG 150)

**Knight of the Order** (SCAG 151)

**Mercenary Veteran** (SCAG 152)

**Urban Bounty Hunter** (SCAG 153)

**Waterdhavian Noble** (SCAG 154)

## Merchant

Before becoming an adventurer, you were a successful merchant operating out of your clan house. Your Clan operated warehouses, organized caravans, managed stores, or owned a ship and has trade contacts throughout the empire. Perhaps they import ore, uncut gems, untreated furs, or grain into the City of Trade, or they export fine cloth, faceted gems, fine furs, or Dragon's Breath, a brandy-like liquor. Regardless, you've largely given that life up for some reason and have chosen to seek adventure instead. Nevertheless, the training you received then, and perhaps the contacts you made, serve you well as an adventurer.

**_Skill Proficiencies._** Insight, Persuasion

**_Tool Proficiencies._** Vehicles (land) and vehicles (water)

**_Equipment._** A fine set of clothes, a signet ring, a letter of introduction from your clans trading house, and a purse

containing 25 kitars.

**_Lifestyle._** Wealthy

Choose one of the following features:

**Feature: Factor**

Although you’ve left the day-to-day life of a merchant behind, your clan has assigned you the services of a loyal retainer from the business, a factor, husbanding agent, seafarer, caravan guard, or clerk. This individual is a commoner who can perform mundane tasks for you such as making purchases, delivering messages, and running errands. He or she will not fight for you and will not follow you into obviously dangerous areas (such as dungeons), and will leave if frequently endangered or abused. If he or she is killed, the family assigns you another within a few days.

[Note: This feature is a variant of the Noble Knight's Retainers feature.]

**Alternate Feature: Trade Contact**

You and your clan have trade contacts such as caravan masters, shopkeepers, sailors, artisans, and farmers throughout the empire. Once per game session, when adventuring in either of those areas, you can use those contacts to get information about the local area or to pass a message to someone in those areas, even across the great distance between the two areas.

[Note: This feature is a variant of the Criminal Contact and Researcher features.]

**[H1] Chapter 2 Character Creation**

Designing a character for Tékumel d20 is your chance, as a player, to have some input into the style of game you will be playing, and the kind of stories you will be telling. If you want plenty of battles – play a warrior; if temple intrigue is more your thing, create a political-oriented priest. You may be playing this character a while, so do take the time to personalise her, adding quirks and thinking about her past history as well as her current aims. Do talk to the GM, too, particularly if you have any questions.

[H2] Character Classes

All Tékumel d20 characters come from one of the following character classes: Entertainer, Expert, Guard, Labourer, Legionary, Merchant, Noble, Scout, or Sorcerer.

[H3] Entertainer

[H4] Characteristics

[H4] Other Classes

[H4] Hit Dice and Ability Scores

The Entertainer uses d8 Hit Dice.

All Entertainers have need of Charisma more than any other Ability Score. They always rely on personal interaction, even those whose entertainment work is also a cover for less socially approved activities. Depending on the Entertainer’s clan and the precise nature of his or her profession, almost any other Ability Score can also be useful, but Entertainers with a reasonable score in Intelligence, Wisdom, and Dexterity are common.

[H4] Class Skills and Skill Points

The Entertainer’s class Skills (and the key Ability for each) are: Balance (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Bribe (Cha), Climb (Str), Concentration (Con), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Gather Information (Cha), Hide (Dex), Jump (Str), Knowledge: Foreign Culture (Int), Knowledge: Geography (Int),  Knowledge: History (Int), Knowledge: Local (Int), Knowledge: Religion (Int), Move Silently (Dex), Perform: Any (Cha), Seduce (Cha), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Speak Languages (None), Teamwork (Wis), Tumble (Dex), Melee Attack, Ranged Attack, and Unarmed Attack.

• Skill Points at 1st Level = (8 + Int Modifier) x 4

• Skill Points at Each Additional Level = 8 + Int modifier

Background (Ex): The Entertainer may select one of the following Backgrounds at 1st level. New Backgrounds can be devised at the GM’s discretion.

_Musician:_ Musicians are valued throughout Tékumel, with everyone from peasants to princes enjoying a good tune. A musician gains a +2 bonus on all Perform checks relating to any musical instrument (including song).

At 4th level and every three levels thereafter, the musician may choose one additional musical instrument to learn. The musician immediately gains a sufficient number of Ranks in Perform with the chosen instrument to match his or her highest Perform skill. This skill increases in step with the highest Perform rank, without any need to spend additional skill points.

_For example, Terutra is a musician who always keeps her Perform (drum) at the maximum possible, by spending one skill point to increase her Perform (drum) Rank by one each time she rises in level. Thus at 3rd level she has +6 Ranks in Perform (drum), but no other Perform skills. On attaining 4th level she spends a skill point to increase her Perform (drum) ranks to +7, but she also gains +7 ranks in another musical instrument. She chooses Perform (harp), and so she now has Perform (drum) +7 and Perform (harp) +7. When she reaches 5th level, she spends another skill point to increase her Perform (drum) skill to +8, and her Perform (harp) skill also increases to +8. At 7th level, she will have Perform (harp) +10 and Perform (drum) +10, and may choose a further Perform skill, perhaps Perform (song) +10._

_Prostitute:_ Prostitutes are found at all levels of Tsolyáni society, from the slave girls hired out by the lowest merchant caravan to high-clan sacred whores dedicated to Dlamélish. A Prostitute gains a +3 bonus on all Seduce checks.

At 4th level, the prostitute learns to use his or her seductive ways and knowledge of others’ desires to influence them in more subtle ways. This can affect any heterosexual characters of the opposite sex to the prostitute, homosexual characters of the same sex, or bisexual characters of either sex. The prostitute gains a +4 bonus with any one Charisma-based skill (other than Seduce), as chosen by the player, when the target, audience, or other creature affected is an appropriate character. At 7th level and every three levels thereafter, the prostitute gains a +4 bonus with another Charisma-based skill in the same circumstances.

_Thief:_ Professional thieves are non-existent in Tsolyáni society. However, certain Entertainers supplement their legitimate income by a small amount of stealing, since their profession gives them many opportunities to plan and carry out theft (as well as to leave town afterwards without appearing any more suspicious than usual). Add Open Lock (Dex) to the Entertainer’s list of Class Skills.

At 4th level, add Disable Device (Int) to the Entertainer’s list of Class Skills. At 7th level, the Entertainer gains a +1 Trap Sense, giving her a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. At 10th level and every three levels thereafter, the Trap Sense bonuses increase by +1.

_Poisoner:_ Entertainers are accused of being poisoners almost as often as they are of being thieves. In most cases neither accusation is accurate, but it is true that there are a few entertainers who will mix a deadly brew for a client unable to afford to go to one of the sanctioned Assassins’ Clans. Add Poisons (Int) to the Entertainer’s list of Class Skills.

At 4th level, add Craft: Apothecary (Int) to the Entertainer’s list of Class Skills. At 7th level, the poisoner no longer risks poisoning him- or herself when preparing poison. At 10th level, the Entertainer gains a +2 bonus to all Poisons checks. At 13th level, the Entertainer gains a +2 bonus to all Craft: Apothecary checks. At 16th level, the Entertainer may craft especially strong poisons at three times the usual cost; these apply a -2 penalty to the target’s saving throw. At 19th level, for ten times the usual cost, the Entertainer may craft a still more concentrated poison that applies a -4 penalty to the target’s saving throw.

_Ritual Priest:_ Every temple recruits charismatic individuals to lead the faithful in worship. Ritual priests are not usually magicians or scholars, but instead devote their lives to bringing others to a greater understanding of their god through dramatic ritual. A ritual priest gains Priest as a bonus feat. At 4th level, the Entertainer gains a +2 bonus to the use of all Charisma-based skills when applied to a worshipper of the same god; at 10th level this bonus increases to +4, and at 16th level to +6. At 7th level, 13th level, and 19th level, the Entertainer gains Promotion: Temple as a bonus feat; if he or she is already 10th circle or higher, select one feat from the Entertainer bonus feat list instead (see below). 

Bonus Feat (Ex): At 2nd level, and every four levels thereafter, the Entertainer gains a bonus feat selected from the following list: Acrobatic, Agile, Alertness, Animal Affinity, Athletic, Attractive, Blessed, Concealment, Confident, Creative, Deceptive, Dodge, Flunkies, Focused, Good Reputation, Great Fortitude, Greatly Blessed, Harmony Amongst the Five Selves, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes, Lucky, Nimble, Performer, Skill Focus, Stealthy, Trustworthy.

Distraction/Manipulation (Ex): Distraction/Manipulation may represent oratorical ability, innate charisma, a beautiful or resonant voice, or even a physical performance or show. This Attribute allows a character to distract a number of people or animals at a critical moment, provided he or she has some method of communicating with them (for example, talking, dancing, illusionary image, written word, etc.) If the character is trying to directly distract a potentially hostile group, such as an angry mob or a group of guards, his or her Rank in Distraction/Manipulation dictates how many people are distracted. If the character has an audience that is already prepared to listen, the Rank determines the percentage of that audience that is moved enough to take action, whether that involves signing up for the army, donating money to the Temple, or supporting the character in a legal case. 

If multiple people with this Attribute work as a team, the total number of people distracted is added together. 

To determine whether Distraction/Manipulation succeeds, the character makes a modified Level check, adding his or her Charisma modifier (1d20 + Entertainer class Level + Charisma). The DC is usually 10 + target’s Wisdom bonus + target’s Level. In the case of a Distraction/Manipulation attempt targeting more than one character, the DC is determined according to the highest level target.

Rank 1 The character can distract one individuals, or 5% of an audience will be motivated.

Rank 2 The character can distract up to two individuals, or 10% of an audience will be motivated.

Rank 3 The character can distract a small crowd (1-10 individuals), or 20% of an audience will be motivated.

Rank 4 The character can distract a medium crowd (11-50 individuals), or 50% of an audience will be motivated.

Rank 5 The character can distract a large crowd (50-200 individuals), or 75% of an audience will be motivated.

Rank 6 The character can distract a very large crowd ([200-1000](tel:200-1000) individuals), or 95-100% of an audience will be motivated.

Contact (Ex): At levels 5, 11, and 17, the Entertainer gains the Contact class feature. The character has a named friend in a position of influence and/or power. The player should develop the friend’s background and personality in consultation with the GM. Friends will go out of their way to help the character, but have other obligations that can interfere with their availability. Furthermore, a character who abuses friendships may find that they become far less useful.

The friend’s actual level of influence should be consistent with the level of the campaign. For example, a rural magistrate is very well-placed to a low-clan person, but not to someone from the Clan of Sea Blue. 

Each time the character gains the Contact class feature, he or she may either choose to have a further contact of Type 1 (see below), or improve the influence or disposition of an existing contact by +1 Type. A multiclassed character who gains the Contact class feature from two or more different classes may improve an existing contact or add a new one as usual.

Type 1 The friend is either a good contact (above the character’s rank in one of the professions) or a competent and close ally.

Type 2 The friend is either a very well-placed contact or a close friend with specifically (and frequently) useful Skills.

Type 3 The friend is extremely well placed or notably loyal and courageous, and will put the character’s welfare before the friend’s own. This Type could also represent a group of friends who are not as well placed or loyal but are still ready to help when needed. A Clan Elder or Lineage head could call on this Level of support from a clanhouse.

Work of Renown (Ex): At 8th level, the Entertainer gains the ability to produce a Work of Renown. This might be a play, show, musical composition, or other use of one of his or her relevant skills that will propel the Entertainer’s name into that particular field as a major performance artist. A Work of Renown may be produced by taking at least three months and expending at least 500 Kaitars on materials, research, etc.

The GM and player should consult as to the precise effects of the Work of Renown on play. Its benefits are usually entirely social, being worth perhaps a Medium Favour owed by some influential figure (which might represent the gift of a physical item, or the gratitude of the character for work done, or similar) or even 1 point of Respect.

Masterpiece (Ex): A Masterpiece is similar in nature to a Work of Renown, but will establish the Entertainer as one of the pre-eminent performers in the field. A Masterpiece takes six months and 1,000 Kaitars to produce.

Again the precise effects should be devised with the GM’s assistance, but +6 to relevant skill rolls, +2 to attack rolls, +4 to damage rolls, +4 to saving throws, a Medium Favour owed by a highly influential figure, or 2 points of Respect, are all possibilities.

[H4] Notes

Saving Throws: At 1st level, the Entertainer decides if he or she will have good Will Saving Throws and poor Reflex Saving Throws, or good Reflex Saving Throws and poor Will Saving Throws. Generally, the more cerebral-oriented Entertainers have a high Will Saving Throw, whereas those who rely on quickness, movement, or acrobatic tricks will have a high Reflex Saving Throw. Once the Entertainer has selected which Saving Throws are good and which are poor, he or she may not alter this selection at a later date.

[H3] Expert 

[H4] Characteristics

[H4] Other Classes

[H4] Hit Dice and Ability Scores

The Expert uses d8 Hit Dice.

An Expert may focus on any one or several of the Ability Scores, depending on his or her role within society. Intelligence is the most common, particularly for craftsmen, bureaucrats, administrative priests, artists, jurists, scholars and scribes, since all Craft and Knowledge skills are Intelligence-based. Wisdom and Charisma are also useful for almost every Expert, as most will regularly be dealing with people during the course of their work -- whether buying, selling, or organising. 

[H4] Class Skills and Skill Points

The Expert may choose any twelve non-combat skills, plus up to two combat skills, to be class skills. These choices are always subject to the GM’s approval, and in some cases the GM may disallow an expert from taking any combat skills as class skills. A player wishing to play an Expert should decide on a character concept and talk it over with the GM so that the two of them can agree on a suitable set of skills. In general, the GM will expect at least six of the chosen class skills to be directly relevant to the chosen profession, and the remaining six to be at least tangentially relevant. Several sample Expert character concepts are given in a sidebar. 

Note: An Expert may wish to have more flexibility with some of the catch-all skills. For example, a Scholar should be able to take any Knowledge skill, since he or she is likely to have picked up a smattering of all manner of subjects. In this case, the GM may allow the character to trade four of his or her usual twelve skills for a single Knowledge: Any, Profession: Any, Craft: Any, or Perform: Any option. This variant is used in the sample Scholar character concept in the sidebar.

• Skill Points at 1st Level = (10 + Int Modifier) x 4

• Skill Points at Each Additional Level = 10 + Int modifier

[[[ Begin Sidebar ]]]

[H3] Expert Character Concept Examples

The following character concepts are provided as suggestions. They are easily modified to create slightly variant concepts. For example, an Administrative Priest of XX rather than of YY would have XX rather than YY. Likewise, a Chlén-Hide Worker whose main customers are of high clan might have Diplomacy (Cha) instead of Knowledge: Streetwise (Int).

[H4] Artist

Art objects and other things of beauty are highly valued throughout the Empire of the Petal Throne, and a great artist can find renown as well as riches in providing that art.

_Non-Combat Skills:_ Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Craft: Drawing (Int), Craft: Painting (Int), Craft: Sculpture (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Knowledge: History (Int), Knowledge: Local (Int), Knowledge: Nobility (Int), Knowledge: Streetwise (Int), Search (Int), and Spot (Wis).

_Combat Skills:_ Unarmed Attack and Unarmed Defence.

[H4] Bureaucrat

The Tsolyánu Empire is dependent on a vast number of bureaucrats to keep virtually every imaginable matter running smoothly, from mercantile taxes to the logistics of Sakbé road maintenance.

For an administrative priest instead of an imperial bureaucrat, remove the Knowledge: Nobility skill and replace it with Knowledge: Religion skill. An administrative priest should select the Priest feat as one of his or her starting feats — a character who does not do this will only be an apprentice administrative priest, still in training (and liable to be throw out of the priesthood if he or she does not acquire the Priest feat by 3rd level at the latest). 

_Non-Combat Skills:_ Analysis and Planning (Int), Bribe (Cha), Bureaucracy (Int), Concentration (Con), Diplomacy (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge: Business (Int), Knowledge: Local (Int), Knowledge: Mathematics (Int), Knowledge: Nobility (Int), Sense Motive (Wis), and Speak Language (None).

_Combat Skills:_ Unarmed Attack and Unarmed Defence.

[H4] Chlén-Hide Smith-Tanner

Chlén-hide is used by members of all social classes and professions, and so an astute chlén-hide smith-tanner will happily make goods for whoever can pay his or her fee. Like most artisans, though, chlén-hide smith-tanners tend to attract customers appropriate to their own status, so that a Broken Reed smith-tanner will sell to a higher class of buyer than a High Tower smith-tanner.

_Non-Combat Skills:_ Appraise (Int), Craft: Butcher (Int), Craft: Chlén-Hide Worker (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Knowledge: Business (Int), Knowledge: Local (Int), Knowledge: Streetwise (Int), Knowledge: Physical Sciences (Int), Medical (Wis), Search (Int), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spot (Wis).

_Combat Skills:_ Unarmed Attack and Unarmed Defence.

[H4] Diplomat

Diplomats can come from a variety of backgrounds, but almost all are from high or very high clans. The Expert character class can cover both Tsolyáni and foreign diplomats.

Note that diplomats are often given small, compact projectile weapons, sometimes even Eyes, with which to defend themselves while fleeing the area if need be.

_Non-Combat Skills:_ Bluff (Cha), Bribe (Cha), Diplomacy (Cha), Gather Information (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge: Foreign Culture (Int), Knowledge: Geography (Int), Knowledge: Nobility (Int), Knowledge: Tsolyánu Culture (Int), Listen (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Speak Language (None).

_Combat Skills:_ Ranged Attack _or_ Special Ranged Attack, and Unarmed Defence.

[H4] Jeweller

Note that the presence of High Cartography in this jeweller’s skill list marks him or her as a particularly high-clan and knowledgeable jeweller. A lower-clan jeweller, who specialised in making cheap but impressive-looking jewellery for poor weddings, would drop High Cartography and Knowledge: Nobility from the skill list in favour of Gather Information (Cha) and Knowledge: Streetwise (Int).

_Non-Combat Skills:_ Appraise (Int), Bribe (Cha), Craft: Goldsmithing (Int), Craft: Jewellery (Int), High Cartography (Int), Knowledge: Business (Int), Knowledge: Local (Int), Knowledge: Nobility (Int), Knowledge: Physical Sciences (Int), Profession: Miner (Wis), Search (Int), and Spot (Wis).

_Combat Skills:_ Unarmed Attack and Unarmed Defence.

[H4] Jurist

Tsolyáni law is frequently convoluted in application, particularly when Temple Law and other bye-laws are taken into account. Jurists and lawyers are an essential tool of both the Clans and the Temples in ensuring their own interests are served and their rivals’ plots thwarted.

_Skills:_ Analysis and Planning (Int), Bluff (Cha), Bribe (Cha), Diplomacy (Cha), Gather Information (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge: Business (Int), Knowledge: Law (Int), Knowledge: Local (Int), Knowledge: Tsolyáni Culture, Research (Int), and Sense Motive (Wis).

_Combat Skills:_ Unarmed Attack and Unarmed Defence.

 [H4] Scholar or Scribe

Most scholars are also Priests (see the Priest feat, page XX), attached to one or another temple. Certain clans may also employ scholars for their own purposes, and of course the Imperial administration employs vast numbers of scribes.

_Skills:_ Analysis and Planning (Int), Concentration (Con), Craft: Book Manufacturer (Int), Craft: Calligraphy (Dex), Decipher Script (Int), Instruction (Wis), Knowledge: Any (Int), Research (Int), and Speak Language (None).

_Combat Skills:_ Unarmed Attack and Unarmed Defence.

[H4] Winemaker

Though there are no taverns on Tékumel, the winemakers’ clan buildings always include rooms and halls to rent out for private parties, and so a professional winemaker will often serve as host as well as manufacturing the drinks.

_Skills:_ Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Craft: Cooper (Int), Craft: Vintner (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Knowledge: Business (Int), Knowledge: Domestic Arts (Int), Knowledge: Local (Int), Listen (Wis), Profession: Farmer (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spot (Wis).

[[[ End Sidebar ]]]

Skill Focus: At 1st level and every four levels thereafter, the Expert gains Skill Focus as a bonus feat.

Bonus Feat (Ex): At 2nd level and every four levels thereafter, the Expert gains a bonus feat chosen from the following list: Animal Affinity, Crafter, Deceitful, Deft Hands, Diligent, Dodge, Great Fortitude, Investigator, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes, Martial Weapon Proficiency, Scholar, Skill Focus, Wealthy

Skill Mastery (Ex): At 3rd level, the Expert becomes so certain in the use of some of her skills that she can use them reliably even under adverse conditions

Upon gaining this ability, she selects two skills. When making a skill check with one of these skills, she may take 10 even if stress and distractions would normally prevent her from doing so. Each time the Expert gains this special ability, she selects additional skills for it to apply to.

At 7th level, 11th level, and 15th level, the Expert may choose a further two skills in which to gain Skill Mastery.

Contacts (Ex): At 4th level and every four levels thereafter, the Expert gains the Contact class feature. The character has a named friend in a position of influence and/or power. The player should develop the friend’s background and personality in consultation with the GM. Friends will go out of their way to help the character, but have other obligations that can interfere with their availability. Furthermore, a character who abuses friendships may find that they become far less useful.

The friend’s actual level of influence should be consistent with the level of the campaign. For example, a rural magistrate is very well-placed to a low-clan person, but not to someone from the Clan of Sea Blue. 

Each time the character gains the Contact class feature, he or she may either choose to have a further contact of Type 1 (see below), or improve the influence or disposition of an existing contact by +1 Type. A multiclassed character who gains the Contact class feature from two or more different classes may improve an existing contact or add a new one as usual.

Type 1 The friend is either a good contact (above the character’s rank in one of the professions) or a competent and close ally.

Type 2 The friend is either a very well-placed contact or a close friend with specifically (and frequently) useful Skills.

Type 3 The friend is extremely well placed or notably loyal and courageous, and will put the character’s welfare before the friend’s own. This Type could also represent a group of friends who are not as well placed or loyal but are still ready to help when needed. A Clan Elder or Lineage head could call on this Level of support from a clanhouse.

Type 4 The friend is very powerful for the campaign setting, or is a loyal and/or well-placed group.

Type 5 The friend is, or controls, a powerful organisation in the campaign setting.

Work of Renown (Ex): At 8th level, the Expert gains the ability to produce a Work of Renown. This is any crafted item, scholarly work, or other use of one of his or her skills that will propel the Expert’s name into that particular field as a known authority on the subject, superior craftsperson, or similar. A Work of Renown may be produced by taking at least two months and expending at least 500 Kaitars on materials, research, etc.

The GM and player should consult as to the precise effects of the Work of Renown on play, but bonuses of +3 to relevant skill rolls, +1 to attack rolls, +2 to damage rolls, or +2 to saving throws are all possibilities if the Work of Renown is a tool, weapon, armour, or other item of equipment. Alternatively, its benefits may be entirely social, being worth perhaps a Medium Favour owed by some influential figure (which might represent the gift of a physical item, or the gratitude of the character for work done, or similar) or even 1 point of Respect.

Advanced Skill Mastery (Ex): From 19th level onwards, the Expert may always Take 20 on any of the skills in which he or she has achieved Skill Mastery, without taking any extra time to do so and even in stressful or distracting conditions. 

Masterpiece (Ex): A Masterpiece is similar in nature to a Work of Renown, but will establish the Expert as one of the pre-eminent authorities in the field, finest craftsperson in the Empire, or similar. A Masterpiece takes six months and 1,000 Kaitars to produce.

Again the precise effects should be devised with the GM’s assistance, but +6 to relevant skill rolls, +2 to attack rolls, +4 to damage rolls, +4 to saving throws, a Medium Favour owed by a highly influential figure, or 2 points of Respect, are all possibilities.

[H3] Guard

Guards are employed by both Temples and Clans. Much of their time is taken up with acting as a security force for the relevant temple complex or clan-house, but as with any group that is effectively a private army, a Guard detachment may occasionally be sent on another mission at the behest of its masters. Many Temple or Clan guards also act as police forces within their assigned area; an example would be the Tomb Police in the service of Lord Sárku, who protect the necropolis of Bey Su.

Some of the more warlike Temples and Clans even form their Guards into legions in time of war. Though Guards are not quite so effective as regular Legionaries in this role, many of a Guard’s skills are certainly transferable to soldiering.

[H4] Characteristics

Guards are expert at spotting, and rapidly dealing with, threats of any kind. This includes raiding parties sent out by rival Temples or Clans, invading enemy armies, and occasionally an opportunist thief or two. The more experienced Guards are also trained as personal bodyguards for high-ranking Temple or Clan personnel.

[H4] Other Classes

Temple guards, as might be expected, get on very well with priests of their own temple, including ritual priests (Entertainers), scholar priests (Sorcerers), and administrative priests (Experts). Indeed, all Temple guards also receive minimal priestly training, becoming Priests of the 1st Circle or sometimes higher.

[H4] Hit Dice and Ability Scores

The Guard uses d10 Hit Dice.

Wisdom and Constitution are of equal importance to the Guard. A Guard must be capable of detecting danger, then enduring it so as to defend his or her Temple or Clan to the last. Strength and Dexterity are also useful, as both these Ability Scores can enhance a variety of attacks against a foe.

[H4] Class Skills and Skill Points

The Guard’s class Skills (and the key Ability for each) are: Climb (Str), Craft (any) (Int), Gather Information (Cha), Heal (Wis), Hide (Dex), Instruction (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge: Culture (Int), Knowledge: Local (Int), Knowledge: Military (Int), Knowledge: Religion (Int), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Perform (any) (Cha), Search (Int), Sense Motive (Wis), Spot (Wis), Swim (Str), Teamwork (Wis), Melee Attack, Melee Defence, Ranged Attack, Ranged Defence, Unarmed Attack, and Unarmed Defence. 

• Skill Points at 1st Level = (6 + Int Modifier) x 4

• Skill Points at Each Additional Level = 6 + Int modifier 

Defensive Bonus (Ex): At 3rd level, the Guard gains a +1 Defensive Bonus. At 6th level and every three levels thereafter, this Defensive Bonus increases by +1. It is cumulative with any Defensive Bonus gained from levels in other classes. The Defensive Bonus applies to the Guard’s Defence Value.

Bonus Feat (Ex): At 2nd level and every three levels thereafter, the Guard gains a bonus feat, chosen from the following list: Promotion: Military, Toughness,

A Temple Guard _must_ select Priest as his or her bonus feat at 2nd level, if this feat has not already been selected.

Sudden Action (Ex): Once per day, a Guard of 7th level can focus his or her effort to burst into sudden action when the situation calls for it. The Guard can change his or her place in the initiative order, moving higher in the count by a equal to one-half his or her class level (rounded down). The Guard can declare the use of this ability at the start of any round, before anyone else takes an action.

Harm’s Way (Ex): Once per round, if a 13th level Guard is adjacent to an ally who is targeted by a direct melee or ranged attack (but not an area effect), the Guard can subject him or herself to the attack in the ally’s stead. If the attack hits the Guard, he or her takes damage normally. If it misses, it also misses the ally.

The Guard must declare his or her intention to place him or herself in harm’s way before the attack roll is made. The Guard selects his or her ally either prior to combat or immediately after the Guard makes his or her initiative check. The Guard can’t change his or her ally for the duration of the combat.

Counterattack (Ex): From 19th level, the Guard is able to block or evade most enemy attacks and immediately launch a devastating counterattack. Up to (3 + Dexterity bonus) times per day, immediately after an enemy has just attempted to make an attack against the Guard but has missed, the Guard may immediately make an attack against the enemy as a free action.

[H4] Notes

[H3] Labourer

Labourers are probably the most common character class in all of Tsolyánu. The class can include peasants, miners, builders, and any other profession that relies on physical strength more than skill. Many slaves are Labourers, though slaves can also be members of most of the other character classes.

[H4] Characteristics

Labourers work, usually with their hands.

[H4] Other Classes

[H4] Hit Dice and Ability Scores

The Labourer uses d10 Hit Dice.

Strength and Constitution are typically the main requirements of any Labourer who wishes to survive the dangerous, hot work of a typical Tsolyáni setting.

[H4] Class Skills and Skill Points

The Labourer’s class Skills (and the key Ability for each) are: Climb (Str), Craft (any) (Int), Gather Information (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge: Local (Int), Perform (any) (Cha), Profession (any) (Wis), Swim (Str), Teamwork (Wis), Unarmed Attack, and Unarmed Defence. 

• Skill Points at 1st Level = (6 + Int Modifier) x 4

• Skill Points at Each Additional Level = 6 + Int modifier 

Bonus Feat (Ex): At 2nd level, and every three levels thereafter, the labourer gains a bonus feat selected from the following list: Toughness, 

Skill Mastery (Ex): At 3rd level, the Labourer becomes so certain in the use of some of her skills that she can use them reliably even under adverse conditions

Upon gaining this ability, she selects two skills. When making a skill check with one of these skills, she may take 10 even if stress and distractions would normally prevent her from doing so. At 3rd level and every six levels thereafter, each time the Labourer gains this special ability, she selects additional skills for it to apply to.

Skill Focus (Ex): At 6th level and every six levels thereafter, the Labourer gains Skill Focus as a bonus feat.

Survivor (Ex): At 7th level, a labourer has been through so much — the harsh regime of a palanquin slave, the unforgiving work of a construction labourer, perhaps a spell down the mines — that he or she is very difficult to stop by any means. An 7th level labourer may reroll any failed saving throw, except if the saving throw was failed with a natural roll of 1 on the d20, up to once per day, at the same DC. 

At 13th level, the labourer may reroll any failed saving throw up to twice per day, and at 19th level up to three times per day. He or she may not reroll the same failed save more than once.

[H5] Magicians’ Sphere of Protection (Optional Rule)

Powerful Magicians with two levels of the Magical Ability Attribute, at least four total levels of Magical Skills (Ritual Magic, Psychic Magic, Energy Management), and a Pedhétl of at least 7 have an aura of power that extends beyond themselves.

Spells cast into, through, or out of this sphere of protection have to overcome this aura. This aura extends out for one metre per Rank of the magician’s Magic: Ritual and Magic: Psychic Skills. 

Any Spells cast in, through, or out of a magician’s aura must overcome that magician’s Magical Resistance — the magician may elect to make him or herself the target of the Spell. If he or she does so, the character may attempt to resist the Spell with a Magic Resistance check as normal (see page xxx). If the character fails, the Spell affects the character, not it’s intended target.

[H2] Sample Characters of Tékumel 

These are examples of Tsolyáni characters, although the GM can also use them as NPCs.

[INSERT SAMPLE CHARACTERS]

[H3] 

**[H1] Chapter 3: Non-Human Player Characters**

Humans are not the only creatures that flourish on Tékumel. Various alien species can also be played as characters, being either allied to the humans of Tsolyáni society, or even, occasionally, accepted into it as full residents and members of Clans. This chapter includes rules for playing those non-human characters.

It's always worth checking with the GM as to the appropriateness of non-human characters for his or her particular campaign – he or she may wish to limit the type and/or number of non-humans, sometimes banning them altogether. The N’lüss, it should be noted, are not strictly alien, but are a human sub-species; some GMs may permit players to be  N’lüss, even if actual aliens are banned.

[H2] Tsolyánu Society and Aliens

Aliens are not exactly welcomed by an often conservative Tsolyáni society. They may be permitted to work, if humans have specific need of them, but even after years of service, will usually still find themselves treated as outsiders (if, sometimes, respected ones). Most are happy with this, seeking only to earn a good sum in Tsolyánu and then retire to their home territories.

A few aliens, notably the Páchi Lei and Pé Chói, can sometimes be welcomed as full members of Tsolyáni society, so long as they are willing to "go native" in terms of both language and customs. Fewer still may even be accepted as members of a Clan, and full citizens, after years of good and loyal service.  This is simulated by selecting the Clan Membership feat (see p. XX).

Only those aliens who commonly work within Tsolyánu are presented in this chapter. Details of the feared Ssú and Hlüss, alien species utterly inimical to humans, can be found in the Bestiary (see p. XX).

[H2] Ahoggyá

[GRAPHIC: AHOGGYA]

The Ahoggyá are human height or a little smaller, with strong, large (0.8 metre diameter) barrel-shaped bodies and eight powerful limbs. Their four legs and four arms are arranged in radial symmetry, extending from the body at equidistant intervals. Each hand has three fingers and a thumb. The have four face-like areas, each with two eyes, one face between each pair of arms. Only one of the faces has a mouth. Over the arms and faces is a dome-shaped armoured shell. Below the shell, their bodies are thickly furred with a tangle of bristles extending down to the knee. This fur seems to be responsible for the notorious smell that other races complain about. 

Those Ahoggyá who spend a few years in Tsolyánu usually work as mercenary soldiers, arena fighters, or other violent professions. They rarely stay much longer than that, or make serious efforts to integrate with Tsolyáni society. Some observers think that the complex, eight-sexed process of Ahoggyá reproduction may be part of the reason they tend to return to their swampy homes, since it must be difficult to assemble a suitable mating group from the relatively small Ahoggyá populations scattered around Tsolyánu.

[H3] Stereotypes

As far as humans are concerned, Ahoggyá are smelly, noisy, rude, and crude, beyond even what one would expect from most sentient non-humans. The phrase "eating like an Ahoggyá," popular around Jakálla, is used to refer to a noisy, open-mouthed eater. 

Their eating habits also include extreme omnivorousness, with Ahoggyá happily eating carrion, insects, and other foods disgusting to humans. Worse still, they have no compunction about eating sentient beings, and find human flesh delicious.

Ahoggyá are valued for their strength, bravery, reliability, and robustness. An Ahoggyá with a job to do will do it, or die trying, at least to the best of its understanding. Their typically subhuman intelligence, and poor language skills, mean that an Ahoggyá's employer must take especial care to make instructions clear.

[H3] The Reality

Ahoggyá once built starships, but despite this, most of the stereotypes are true enough. Modern Ahoggyá would not be capable of such a feat, and it must be presumed that their intelligence has degenerated since their arrival on Tékumel. That low intelligence, combined with the fact that humans are as little interested in truly understanding Ahoggyá culture and customs as Ahoggyá are theirs, leads to frequent misunderstanding and significant cultural gulfs between the two races. Ahoggyá seem irrational, obsessive, uncontrolled and impulsive, to humans. Furthermore, they really do love the taste of human flesh, and so are barred from entrance to the Tsolyáni necropolises.

[H3] Clan and Lineage

It is rare indeed that an á would desire to join a human clan, and rarer still that a clan would accept one as a member. Most clans would be insulted even at the suggestion, as an Ahoggyá member could seriously reduce their prestige.

[H3] Religion

Ahoggyá appear to hold no religious rituals other than large community dances, but even these may really be primitive courtship rites with no particular religious context. Their apparent lack of religion means that Tsolyáni law treats them as animals for most purposes, preventing them from gaining citizenship (but meaning they only need pay half as much tax as supposed sentient creatures).

[H3] Effective Character Level

Based on the Ahoggyá’s Racial Traits, an Ahoggyá has an Effective Character Level of +1. In terms of game balance, a 1st level Ahoggyá is equivalent to a 2nd level human. This means that the GM should only allow a 1st level Ahoggyá to play in a campaign if he or she would allow a human character to start out at 2nd level in the same campaign. 

[Ability Scores +0 CP, Armour +4 CP (5, -1 for Partial), Extra Arms +2 CP, Extra Attacks +11 CP (16, -3 due to the associated attack penalty, -2 due to restriction on attacking same person), Extra Defence +3 CP, Heightened Senses +1 CP = 2 + 5 + 2 + 11 + 3 +1 = 21 CP, Low Pedhétl 2 BP, Clanless 2 BP, Social Disadvantage 4 BP, Poor Verbal Skills 1 BP, Total 21 - 9 = 12 CP, ECL 1)

[H3] Racial Traits

Ahoggyá characters have the following racial traits.

Strength: Ahoggyá are very strong, gaining a +2 racial bonus to Strength.

Dexterity: Ahoggyá are clumsy, with a -2 racial penalty to Dexterity.

Constitution: Ahoggyá are extremely tough physically, and gain a +4 racial bonus to Constitution.

Intelligence: Ahoggyá are not very smart, and have a -2 racial penalty to Intelligence.

Wisdom: Ahoggyá are extremely strong-willed, and seem to feel no fear. Their eight eyes ensure they are also more perceptive and generally aware of their surroundings than the average human. All Ahoggyá have a +2 racial bonus to Wisdom.

Charisma: Although Ahoggyá must find one another attractive and worthy of respect in some way, other races perceive them as ugly, boorish, and lacking in social skills. They have a -4 racial penalty to Charisma.

Natural Armour: The Ahoggyá’s central barrel is naturally armoured, granting it Armour 5. This counts as partial armour, as the Ahoggyá’s arms are unarmoured. Thus the armour may be bypassed by making a Called Shot as though targeting Medium Armour, and so at a -6 penalty (see page XX).

Extra Limbs: Ahoggyá have four arms. This allows them to wield two two-handed weapons, four one-handed weapons, two one-handed weapons and two shields, or a similar combination. An Ahoggyá wielding several weapons at once may make additional attacks, one for each weapon beyond the first, at a -6 penalty on the attack with its primary hand and a -10 penalty on the attack with its secondary hands (with all the penalties reduced by 2 if the secondary weapons are Light). 

For example, an Ahoggyá who usually has an attack bonus of +6 when wielding a sword may wield four swords, making one attack at +0 and the other three attacks at -4. Alternatively it may wield a sword and three daggers, making one attack at +2 and the other three attacks at -2.

The Multiweapon Fighting feat (see page XX) reduces the base penalty for making multiple attacks to -4 with all the attacks. If the four-sword Ahoggya in the above example had the Multiweapon Fighting feat, it would make its four attacks at +2 each. Using a sword and three daggers, it would make its four attacks at +4 each.

No more than two of an Ahoggyá’s arms may attack any one opponent at a time, since its limbs are spaced evenly around its body. In addition to their extra attacks, Ahoggyá may make a second Defence check without any penalty.

Expanded Field of Vision: Ahoggyá have a 360-degree field of vision, making it impossible to sneak up on one while it is awake unless one is concealing oneself or using magic. The Ahoggyá gains a +4 bonus to all Spot checks as a result.

Low Pedhétl: An Ahoggyá has a base Pedhétl of 2, though this can be increased by the Increased Pedhétl feat as usual.

Clanless: An Ahoggyá can never be accepted into a human clan, for any reason. They may not select the Clan Membership feat.

Second-Class Citizen (Non-Human): Ahoggyá, as non-humans, can never be full participants in Tsolyáni life. An Ahoggyá’s relative status, reflected by the Lineage and Wealth Attributes, does not go far in human society.

Poor Enunciation: All Ahoggyá suffer a -2 penalty on Charisma-based skill checks that involve speech, for example the use of Bluff to convince a guard to let the party through a gate. Nonverbal Charisma-based skill checks, such as the use of Bluff to feint in combat, are unaffected.

[H3] Character Classes

Most Ahoggyá who work in Tsolyánu join legions made up solely of Ahoggyá, or work in other combat-  and muscle-oriented professions, with their most common character classes being Guard and Legionary. A small number become Administrative Priests (Experts) or Ritual Priests (Entertainers) as part of human priesthoods. An even smaller number become Sorcerers, though not usually very good ones. The temples of Sárku and Durritlámish will not allow them to join as Priests due to the Ahoggyá taste for human flesh, though may worship those gods.

[H3] Languages

Ahoggyá know their own language and one human language, usually Tsolyáni.

[H3] Naming

Ahoggyá do have their own names, but humans can neither understand nor pronounce them, so tend to give them nicknames. Ahoggyá do not seem to resent this. A list of typical Ahoggyá nicknames is given below.

[H2] Hláka

[GRAPHIC: HLAKA]

The Hláka are slimmer and a little shorter than humans, but their two leathery wings have a span of around 10 meters when unfolded. Other than the wings and their blade-tipped prehensile tails, they are humanoid in form, with two legs and two arms as well as their wings. Their bodies and limbs are furred in gray or brown, with the fur extending over the sides and back of their flat-topped round heads too. They have three eyes, usually blue, close-set under thickly ridged brows. Their mouths are muzzled and sharp-toothed. 

Hláka prefer to fly rather than walk, finding walking very tiring. They need an enormous amount of food for their slight frames, each eating as much as a large and greedy human. Ideally they prefer to eat throughout the day.

Hláka are strictly monogamous, and once they have mated tend to concentrate on child-rearing. Many who come to Tsolyánu do so only to raise funds, returning home to raise child families once they have earned enough. 

[H3] Stereotypes

Hláka are often seen as less intelligent than humans, or even as barely more smart than a clever animal. They make good scouts, given their ability to move fast and see great distances on the wing, but are too cowardly to be truly steady in that role. They can be easily distracted, but seem friendly enough. Their amiable nature means they will not long survive enslavement, soon pining away if kept in chains.

[H3] The Reality

Hláka are just as intelligent as humans, though the "wild" Hláka tend to have poor knowledge of human language and customs, sometimes giving ignorant humans the wrong impression. Most Hláka, wild or "civilized", are basically uninterested in human culture, wars, and concerns, but have their own concerns and interests. Seeing life from the air gives different perspectives, literally and metaphorically. Hláka who serve in  Tsolyáni armies are more likely to acquire strong human language skills, as well as beginning to understand the human perspective on life.

Hláka are physically quite fragile, with a flier's typical hollow bones. This is why they prefer not to get into close combat or risk return fire, though they are quite willing to hurl or drop missiles of all kinds from above.

[H3] Clan and Lineage

Most Hláka never get accepted into human clans, since they are largely uninterested in such things and rarely stay in human society long enough. There are no particular barriers to their entry, though, other than the same social barriers that make it tough for most non-humans to become clan members. Several Hláka have joined clans, in the past.

[H3] Religion

Hláka religion seems very primitive to most humans, apparently consisting of carrying rocks up mountains. In fact, this is done according to a complex astronomical calendar, with different colors of rock having different significance. A few Hláka join human religions, but rarely take such things seriously enough for the liking of most priests.

[H3] Effective Character Level

Based on the Hláka’s Racial Traits, a Hláka has an Effective Character Level of +0. In terms of game balance, a 1st level Hláka is equivalent to a 1st level human.

[Ability Scores -3 CP, Heightened Senses +1 CP, Flight Rank 2 +4 CP (6 CP, Restriction: Only fly at 50 kph 2 BP), Extra Attacks +5 CP (8, -3 due to the associated attack penalty), Natural Weapon +1 CP = -3 + 1 + 4 + 5 + 1 = 8 CP, Social Disadvantages 4 BP, Distractible 1 BP, Awkward Size 1 BP, Restricted Ground Movement 1 BP, Total 8 - 7 = 1 CP, ECL 0)

 [H3] Racial Traits

All Hláka have the following racial traits.

Strength: Hláka are not very strong, and have a -2 racial penalty to Strength

Constitution: Hláka are somewhat spindly and fragile, with weak, hollow bones. They have a -2 racial penalty to Constitution.

Dexterity: Hláka are dextrous and agile, with a +2 racial bonus to Dexterity.

Willpower: Hláka are not strong-willed, taking a -2 racial penalty to Wisdom.

Charisma: Hláka are overly chatty and easily distracted, two factors which reinforce most humans’ automatic prejudice against nonhumans. They have a -2 penalty to Charisma.

Excellent eyesight: Hláka have excellent vision, particularly distance vision. Their wide-set eyes give them a wider field of vision than humans too. They gain a +4 racial bonus to Spot checks.

Flight: Hláka fly extremely well, with a cruising speed of about 20 kph. Flying 100 km a day is no great problem for them, and they could push it to 200 km a day, though would find this very fatiguing. With a strong tailwind, a Hláka could reach a maximum speed of 50 kph, for perhaps 30 seconds at a time. They are very quiet when flying (+2 on Stealth rolls).

Bladed Tail: Hláka have a powerful prehensile tail, terminating in a bony, rapier-like blade. A Hláka can make an additional attack each round with its tail, at a -5 penalty (this penalty is reduced to -2 if the Hláka has the Multiattack feat). The tail deals 1d8 damage, with the Hláka’s Strength bonus applying as usual. Hláka often apply poison to their tails. A Hláka’s Unarmed Attack skill will add to tail attacks as usual.

Distractible: Hláka rarely focus as much on tasks as humans would like. They have a -4 racial penalty on all Concentration and Research checks.

Second-Class Citizen (Non-Human): Hláka, like other non-humans, will never be treated as full citizens in Tsolyáni society. Even one who joined a clan would not be treated so well as human clan members.

Awkward Size: Hláka wings are large, even when folded. This must be taken into account if they ever attempt to fit through narrow spaces.

Restricted Ground Movement: A Hláka can walk for at most 2 hours at a time, due to weak, easily tired leg muscles.

[H3] Character Classes

Most Hláka are Scouts, serving in either Hláka-only legions or with a small number of other Hláka as part of a normal legion. A few are Sorcerers, and career legionaries may be Soldiers, though other Hláka careers are rare.in Tsolyánu.

[H3] Languages

Hláka speak Hláka and one human language, usually Tsolyáni. Their own language seems to humans to consist of nothing more than squeaks, hoots, and whistles.

[ BOXED TEXT ]

[H3] Ground Attacks

Hláka are rarely brave when it comes to physical combat, being well aware of their own fragility. Even primitive Hláka will fight from the air, though, bombarding their foes with pebbles to harass them into leaving, or dropping larger rocks if the warning is ignored. Hláka serving in legions often refine these tactics, and add new ones of their own.

[H4] Stand-Off Attack

This attack is based on old Hláka hunting and defense techniques. They swoop in at an altitude of almost 200m, so as to minimize the risk of return and ensure their own missiles are moving at terminal velocity on impact, fast enough to break skulls or smash through armor. They release the missiles 40m to 50m from their targets, then bank off to the side, never overflying their victims directly. The attack is inaccurate (-4 penalty on the attack roll), making it more useful to attack armies groups than individuals. A dropped rock deals 2d10 damage. If it misses, but strikes a hard surface, anyone within 5' will be dealt 1d6 damage from flying fragments.

[H4] Low-Level Attack

When attacking smaller groups or individuals, Hláka attempt to attack from behind, diving close and low then hurling javelins from around 10m altitude. During such an attack run, the Hláka could potentially throw more than one javelin, continuing the pass for up to 3 rounds, so long as each javelin has a different target. After each pass, it takes them d6+4 rounds to regain enough height to make another pass.

[END CHART]

[H2] Páchi Léi

[GRAPHIC: PACHI LEI]

Páchi Léi are about as tall as humans, but with pear-shaped, soft greenish-gray bodies, four arms, and four legs. Their bodies are coated with buds, and their pointy heads with spikes. They have eight limbs: four arms and four legs. Their muzzles are filled with teeth, and their large, round eyes have excellent night-vision. They have a limited precognitive psychic power, allowing them a chance of sensing danger within around 3m.

Each of the buds on a Páchi Léi contains an egg, which can be fertilized by spore-like spermatozoa from other Páchi Léi, when the latter are in the fertile phases of their four-year mating cycle. A fertilised egg-bud grows into a larger pod. Eventually (after a 250-day incubation) an infant bursts out of the pod. Páchi Léi do not truly have families, but tend to live in small social groups of around two to eight.

Unlike most of the other non-human races, Páchi Léi frequently settle in Tsolyánu indefinitely, and can even progress to high rank. They are currently being invaded by the Mu’ugalavyáni, which may motivate many Páchi Léi  to emigrate to Tsolyánu in the first place.

[H3] Stereotypes

Páchi Léi are often seen as cowards, because the prefer to negotiate – or, failing that, to run or hide – rather than harm others. They are socialized and civilized, and fit in well with Tsolyáni society.

[H3] The Reality

Páchi Léi are not truly cowardly. Most would rather find non-violent solutions, and regard violence as essentially uncivilized and anti-social. There are fewer dedicated warriors among the Páchi Léi than among most races, but they certainly do exist, serving as soldiers and even officers in the legions. Even the most mild-mannered Páchi Léi, with enough provocation, can enter a "biyúrh" berserk state.

Their motivations remain mysterious, given their lack of a sex drive or sexual desire, and their lack of a family. 

[H3] Clan and Lineage

Páchi Léi are sometimes allowed into human clans, though not usually high-ranking clans. The descendants of a  Páchi Léi accepted into a clan are considered to be full clan members too.

[H3] Religion

Páchi Léi have their own dualistic religion, revering N’rg, god of wisdom and stability, and  Á’lsh, god of change and sorcery. Páchi Léi who settle in Tsolyánu tend to go native, choosing a human god to worship instead.

[H3] Effective Character Level

Based on the Páchi Léi’s Racial Traits, a Páchi Léi has an Effective Character Level of +2. In terms of game balance, a 1st level Páchi Léi is equivalent to a 3rd level human. This means that the GM should only allow a 1st level Páchi Léi to play in a campaign if he or she would allow a human character to start out at 3rd level in the same campaign. 

[Ability Scores +0 CP, High Pedhétl +1 CP, Extra Arms +2 CP, Extra Attacks +13 CP (16, -3 due to the associated attack penalty), Extra Defence +3 CP, Heightened Senses +2 CP, Sixth Sense +1 CP = 1 + 2 + 13 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 22 CP, Social Disadvantage 2 BP, Total 22 - 2 = 20 CP, ECL 2)

[H3] Racial Traits

Páchi Léi characters have the following racial traits.

High Pedhétl: Páchi Léi start a base Pedhétl of 5. 

Extra Limbs: Páchi Léi have four arms. This allows them to wield two two-handed weapons, four one-handed weapons, two one-handed weapons and two shields, or a similar combination. They frequently fight with a combination of weapons and shields in their four hands. A Páchi Léi wielding several weapons at once may make additional attacks, one for each weapon beyond the first, at a -6 penalty on the attack with its primary hand and a -10 penalty on the attack with its secondary hands (with all the penalties reduced by 2 if the secondary weapons are Light). 

For example, a Páchi Léi who usually has an attack bonus of +6 when wielding a sword may wield four swords, making one attack at +0 and the other three attacks at -4. Alternatively it may wield a sword and three daggers, making one attack at +2 and the other three attacks at -2.

The Multiweapon Fighting feat (see page XX) reduces the base penalty for making multiple attacks to -4 with all the attacks. If the four-sword Páchi Léi in the above example had the Multiweapon Fighting feat, it would make its four attacks at +2 each. Using a sword and three daggers, it would make its four attacks at +4 each.

In addition to their extra attacks, Páchi Léi may make a second Defence check without any penalty.  

Expanded Field of Vision: Relative to humans, Páchi Léi have a far wider field of vision, and gain a +4 racial bonus to Spot checks.

Darkvision: Páchi Léi can see in the dark. Darkvision works exactly like normal sight, and Páchi Léi can function just fine with no light at all.

Sixth Sense: Páchi Léi can perceive ambushes, secret doors, and physical dangers within a three-metre range about half the time. The GM makes a Wisdom check for the Pachi Lei in secret, with a DC of 10. If the check succeeds, the GM will inform the Páchi Léi that it perceives “something” with its Sixth Sense, but not what or which direction. A Páchi Léi who has perceived a potential attack this way cannot be surprised by the attackers.

Second-Class Citizen: Though Páchi Léi are generally tolerated better than most non-humans, they can still never progress far in human society, unless they join a clan. Any Páchi Léi who is a full member of a human clan ignores this penalty.

[H3] Character Classes

Páchi Léi may participate in any Character Classes in Tsolyánu without restriction, though they will generally not rise to the highest levels outside the military (where they are mostly segregated into Páchi Léi legions).

[H2] Pé Chói

[ILLUSTRATION PÉ CHÓI]

Pé Chói are tall, thin, insect-like creatures, with a full height of 1.65 to 2.2 meters for an adult male. They have chitinous exoskeletons, jet-black in males and chalk-white in females, with gray areas around the eyes and ears. Pé Chói of both sexes sometimes change to a neuter stage; when males do this, they shrink a little, and become paler in color, though formerly female neuters remain superficially identical. Pé Chói are six-limbed, with a pair of powerful rear legs and two pairs of more hand-like forelimbs. They also have prehensile tails. Their heads are elongated, like their bodies, with big green eyes and fan-like ears. 

Pé Chói have very sharp senses, including a psychic sense with which they tell if another Pé Chói has been killed recently (in the past 24 hours) in the immediate area (5 kilometers), as well as sensing the presence of other creatures within a few meters. They dislike being immersed in water, as they breath through abdominal spiracles and so can easily drown. 

Pé Chói have been living among humans for many thousands of years, and many are fully integrated into human society.

[H3] Stereotypes

Pé Chói are well-liked by humans, who think of them as clever, subtle, and controlled. Their sophisticated attitude can come across as cold and over-intellectual, though, and some humans who prefer direct action get annoyed with the Pé Chói tendency to avoid physical pursuits. They are not considered to be ambitious politically, though they can make good negotiators, thanks to strong social skills. Pé Chói who have joined human society are seen as very human-like.

[H3] The Reality

Since Pé Chói are so well-known to humans, the above stereotypes are reasonably accurate. However, some Pé Chói are certainly physically active, and even coldly violent if serving in a legion. Likewise, a rare few are politically ambitious, with some rising to very high levels in human society, occasionally even befriending the highest nobles of the land.

Though Pé Chói do fit in to human society well, there are still truly alien aspects to their psychology, such as their concept of "Ntk-dqékt." This incorporates aspects of paradoxical detachment-and-union, existential nausea, stoicism, bereavement, pain, and other far less comprehensible concepts, and is believed to be a major part of every Pé Chói's life. Some scholars believe the Pé Chói psychic sense is partly to blame, allowing members of this race to sense each other yet only faintly. If it is the last vestige of something that was once a far more powerful interconnectivity, this could account for their sense of loss.

[H3] Clan and Lineage

Pé Chói can be, and often are, fully accepted into clans, even very high-ranking ones.

[H3] Religion

Originally the Pé Chói worshipped only the Father of Nests, who is closely related to the Gods of Stability. In the last 1300 years, encouraged by a human Tsolyáni Emperor, another god has been worshiped too, the Black Old One, encompassing the Gods of Change. In human society, many Pé Chói adopt human gods, usually Hnálla or Hrü’ü, occasionally Thúmis or Ksárul, or perhaps Karakán and Vimúhla for Pé Chói in the legions. 

[H3] Effective Character Level

Based on the Pé Chói’s Racial Traits, a Pé Chói has an Effective Character Level of +2. In terms of game balance, a 1st level Pé Chói is equivalent to a 3rd level human. This means that the GM should only allow a 1st level Pé Chói to play in a campaign if he or she would allow a human character to start out at 3rd level in the same campaign. 

[Ability Scores +1 CP, High Pedhétl +2 CP, Armour +2 CP, Extra Arms +2 CP, Extra Attacks +13 CP (16, -3 due to the associated attack penalty), Extra Defence +3 CP, Heightened Senses +2 CP, Telepathy +1 CP = 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 13 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 26 CP, Social Disadvantage 2 BP, Environmental 1 BP, Slow Healing 2 BP, Water Phobia 1 BP, Total 26 - 6 = 20 CP, ECL 2)

[H3] Racial Traits

Pé Chói characters have the following racial traits.

Dexterity: Pé Chói are more dextrous than humans. All Pé Chói have a +2 racial bonus to Dexterity.

High Pedhétl: Pé Chói start with a base Pedhétl of 6. 

Natural Armour: A Pé Chói’s chitinous exoskeleton is equivalent to Armour 2.

Extra Limbs: Pé Chói have four arms. This allows them to wield two two-handed weapons, four one-handed weapons, two one-handed weapons and two shields, or a similar combination. A Pé Chói wielding several weapons at once may make additional attacks, one for each weapon beyond the first, at a -6 penalty on the attack with its primary hand and a -10 penalty on the attack with its secondary hands (with all the penalties reduced by 2 if the secondary weapons are Light). 

For example, a Pé Chói who usually has an attack bonus of +6 when wielding a sword may wield four swords, making one attack at +0 and the other three attacks at -4. Alternatively it may wield a sword and three daggers, making one attack at +2 and the other three attacks at -2.

The Multiweapon Fighting feat (see page XX) reduces the base penalty for making multiple attacks to -4 with all the attacks. If the four-sword Pé Chói in the above example had the Multiweapon Fighting feat, it would make its four attacks at +2 each. Using a sword and three daggers, it would make its four attacks at +4 each.

In addition to their extra attacks, Pé Chói may make a second Defence check without any penalty.

Good Eyesight: Pé Chói receive a +4 bonus to Stat all Spot checks.

Good Hearing: Pé Chói receive a +4 bonus to all Listen checks.

Telepathy: Pé Chói can psychically sense the presence (but not thoughts) of  creatures within a 2-meter radius. It also allows them to sense when another Pé Chói (only) is killed within a five-kilometer radius, or if one has been killed within the past 24 hours.

Second-Class Citizen: Pé Chói are nonhumans and so can never fully participate in Tsolyáni life. A Pé Chói’s relative status (Lineage and Wealth, in game terms) does not go far in human society. They are far more tolerated than are most nonhumans, nevertheless.

Environmental Limitation: Pé Chói breathe both their mouths and through spiracles on their abdomen and tail. They can consciously control the spiracles, closing them temporarily, but it is hard to maintain this (requiring Concentration checks, DC 10, with a cumulative penalty of -2 per round), as they have an instinctive response to stress that involves opening the spiracles as wide as possible for maximum oxygen. They are unable to learn to swim (though a Pé Chói could potentially float for as long as it could hold its breath), and even shallow water can drown them.

Slow Healing: Pé Chói heal at half the normal rate (rounded down), as it takes longer for their exoskeleton to heal than flesh. 

If a  Pé Chói  is reduced to less than 50% of its starting hit points, it will not heal naturally. Only magic, or a character with the Heal skill and the special materials required to clean and patch the exoskeleton (only found in a Pé Chói healing kit), can repair such an injury.

Water Phobia: As a result of the Environmental Limitation mentioned earlier, Pé Chói tend to be phobic of water. Inevitably this phobia further enhances the panic that causes the spiracles to open. A Pé Chói in water must make a Will saving throw (DC 15) on the first round, or immediately open its spiracles as panic sets in. Furthermore, the character will be extremely reluctant to enter water (Will saving throw, DC 15, to even enter water voluntarily in the first place). Note that this phobia can be overcome by the Water Tolerance feat (see p. XX).

[H3] Character Classes

Pé Chói have no Character Class restrictions, and are welcome (at least, as welcome as non-humans ever are) in all aspects of human society. Pé Chói Legionaries and Scouts rarely join legions, though, except for specific Pé Chói Auxiliary legions.

[H3] Languages

There are several variant Pé Chói languages, or at least dialects. A Pé Chói will know one of these, and  Tsolyáni (or, if preferred, a different human language). Humans often think that Pé Chói have odd accents – either flat and emotionless, or sinister and hissing – but Pé Chói have no difficulty communicating in Tsolyáni.

[H3] Naming

The following are examples of Pé Chói names.

[BEGIN CHART]

[Insert names here]

[END CHART]

[H2] Shén

[GRAPHIC: SHEN]

The Shén originally hail from the Antares system, and are scaly, black, and reptile-like. An adult Shén is the height of a tall human (2 meters), and has large, strong legs, clawed hands, and a club-tipped tail. They have long, pointed snouts, and many sharp teeth. A ridge-like crest of shiny spines tops their heads, standing upright at moments of heightened emotion. 

There are three distinct Shén sexes: egg-creators, egg-layers, and egg-fertilizers. The first two are the closest analogues to males and females in humans. Egg-layers and egg-fertilisers are slightly less black than egg-creators, with dark gray scales particularly on their abdomens and upper faces. Shén of all sexes tend to become paler and grayer with age. Some Shén, perhaps inspired by human fashions, paint their scales.

Shén do not like to stay in Tsolyánu for too many years, not getting on well with the northern climate, particularly during its cold winters (cold compared to their equatorial regions, which humans would find dangerously hot). Most thus do not integrate fully into human society, only rarely joining clans. Thanks to their strength and claws, they usually find it easy to get work in legions or as guards, though their large and rather clumsy hands mean they need to use specially made weapons.

[H3] Stereotypes

Shén are seen as strong, stupid goons, barely able to speak intelligibly, and fit for thuggery but not much else. They are believed to consume human flesh without compunction, and frequently fight amongst themselves. They have also been seen attacking Ahoggyá on sight and without provocation.

[H3] The Reality

Shén are far from stupid, being very close to human intelligence. Indeed, they are former starfarers, with an old, complex, and baroque culture (though it must be borne in mind that Shén in Tsolyánu have left that culture, at least temporarily). They have no particular taboo about cannibalism, and have always eaten their own children, strengthening the genetic pool by preying on the weak. 

**It is true that Shén tend to be quite aggressive, by human standards. This stereotype is exaggerated because most  Shén seen in Tsolyánu are professional mercenaries or gladiators, and thus are aggressive even by Shén standards. When they attack each other, seemingly without reason, it is actually because Shén become instinctively angered in the presence of other Shén from rival "egg-groups". This is a pheromonal effect which it is hard for Shén to overcome. Their long-standing dislike of Ahoggyá can also lead to conflic.**

[H3] Clan and Lineage

It is extremely rare for Shén to want to join, or indeed to be invited to join, a human clan.

[H3] Religion

The native Shén religion has two main gods,  The One Of Eggs and The One Who Rends, roughly analogous to Stability and Change. Shén living in Tsolyánu often select a local deity that corresponds reasonably well with their general affiliation, and with their character class.

[H3] Effective Character Level

Based on the Shén Racial Traits, a Shén has an Effective Character Level of +1. In terms of game balance, a 1st level Shén is equivalent to a 2nd level human. This means that the GM should only allow a 1st level Shén to play in a campaign if he or she would allow a human character to start out at 2nd level in the same campaign. 

[Ability Scores +1 CP, Armour +2 CP, Natural Weapons +4 CP, Extra Attacks +13 CP (16, -3 due to the associated attack penalty), Heat Tolerance +1 CP = 1 + 2 + 4 + 13 + 1 = 22 CP, Low Pedhétl 2 BP, Social Disadvantage 4 BP, Huge Hands 1 BP, Pheromones 2 BP, Impaired Charisma 1 BP, Total 21 - 10 = 11 CP, ECL 1)

 [H3] Racial Traits

Strength: Shén are very strong, with a +4 racial bonus to Strength.

Constitution: Shén are extremely tough, and gain a +4 bonus to Constitution.

Dexterity: Shén are clumsy, and have a -4 racial penalty to Dexterity.

Intelligence: Shén are not quite as smart as humans, with a -2 racial penalty to Intelligence.

Willpower: Shén are strong-willed, and have a +2 racial bonus to Wisdom

Charisma: Shén are seen as thuggish, stupid cannibals with few positive qualities. They have a -2 racial penalty to Charisma.

Low Pedhétl: Shén have a base Pedhétl of 2.

Natural Armour: Shén have natural armor, from their tough hide and scales. This is counted as Armour 2.

Natural Weapons: Shén have claws (1d8 damage), a hard beak (1d6 damage), and a powerful tail, with a bony club on the end that may be used in combat (1d6 damage). A Shén may attack with all four weapons in a round, with no penalty for the claw attacks and a -5 penalty for the beak and tail attacks. The Multiattack feat reduces this penalty to -2.

A Shén which wields a manufactured weapon in one of its claws may attack with the weapon, as well as making attacks with its natural weapons as normal (no penalty for the second claw attack; -5 for the beak and tail attacks, or -2 with Multiattack). It may wield a weapon in one claw and a shield in the other, as well as using its beak and tail attacks at the usual penalties. A Shén wielding a two-handed weapon with both claws may also make beak and tail attacks at the usual penalties.

A Shén wielding two manufactured weapons, one in each hand, applies the usual penalties for two-weapon combat, as well as the usual reductions to those penalties for one or both weapons being light or for the Two-Weapon Fighting feat.

Heat Tolerant: Shén are resistant to heat, suffering no ill effects from it until it gets well beyond the temperatures in the human-occupied areas of Tékumel.

Second-Class Citizen (Nonhuman): Shén, as non-humans, can never be full participants in Tsolyáni life. A Shén’s relative status, reflected by its Lineage and Wealth, does not go far in human society.

Huge Hands: Shén hands are so large and clumsy that they cannot use most human weapons competently. They receive a -2 penalty to attack rolls when using weapons not manufactured to Shén scale.

Pheromones: Shén are segregated by “egg-group.” To any one Shén, some egg-groups are friendly to his or her own, most are neutral, and some are enemies to be attacked on sight. The Shén can scent others' egg-groups by the pheromones they give off, and will tend to attack those from enemy egg-groups, acting on instinct. He or she must make a successful Will save at DC 10 after five minutes spent in the enemy Shén’s presence. If the Shén succeeds at the Will save, it must make a further Will save for each additional five minutes spent near the enemy Shén, but with a cumulative -2 penalty to the save for every five minutes beyond the first. They react the same way to Ahoggyá as they do to Shén of an opposing egg-group, but the Will save DC is 15.

Impaired Charisma: Shén take a -2 penalty to all Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks when dealing with Ahoggyá or with Shén from rival egg groups.

[H3] Character Classes

Shén can become Imperial citizens, but they are unwelcome in both the Priesthood or the Government (the only exceptions being Shén who have the Clan Membership feat; see page XX). They are welcome in Legions or similarly military roles. Almost Legionary Shén are in Shén-specific Legions, though a few work in low-status irregular Legions. No Shén may ever attain a higher rank than Tirrikámu in a non-Shén Legion. So far, not even the most heroic Shén have ever been accepted into a Heavy Infantry or Elite Legion. The most common Shén Character Classes are Laborer, Legionary, and Guard.

[H3] Languages

All Shén know one of the Shén languages — there are several closely-related languages, used by different egg-groups — and one human language (usually Tsolyáni). Shén can never sound like human language native speakers because their vocal apparatus is shaped wrongly. 

[H3] Resources

Shén may spend Resource Points on anything a human can, except to use them to bypass the glass ceilings in their chosen professions.

[H3] Naming

The following are examples of Shén names. They may reflect different dialects and naming conventions of different egg-groups.

[H2] Tinalíya

[GRAPHIC: TINALIYA]

The Tinalíya are just 55cm to 75cm tall. A Tinalíya has four short, outwardly bowed legs, a round abdomen, and a pair of long, claw-fingered arms. Their bodies have several small round segments, and are covered with a thick layer of horn in a dark brown, red-brown or tan shade. The have large eyes set into sloping, somewhat humanoid heads. Most  Tinalíya are neuter, with only a small number of males and females. The males, in particular, are almost never found in the human world, and even the neuters and females rarely stay for more than a few years. Most prefer the intricate culture of their own underground cities. 

[H3] Stereotypes

Tinalíya are seen as humorless, and lacking in imagination, particularly when it comes to comprehending metaphor and idiom. Conversely, they are considered to be good at making and repairing machines.

[H3] The Reality

The stereotypes are quite accurate. Tinalíya take everything literally and at face value. Humor and poetry are quite alien to them. Tinalíya love to learn practical, sensible things, though, and are quick to grasp new concepts, so long as those concepts are logical and material. They can be courageous combatants, despite their size, preferring to outsmart opponents but willing to tough it out in a head-to-head brawl if necessary. There are several Tinalíya-only legions, used by the Livyáni to fight against the Mu’ugalavyáni. 

[H3] Clan and Lineage

Tinalíya never join human clans. They are already bound up in their own complex social structure.

[H3] Religion

The Tinalíya are as practical regarding religion as in any other matters. They might join human religions, so long as they have had the relevant god's power satisfactorily demonstrated to them. They do have their own religious beliefs, revolving around a disinterested creator-god.

[H3] Effective Character Level

Based on the Tinalíya Racial Traits, a Tinalíya has an Effective Character Level of +0. In terms of game balance, a 1st level Tinalíya is equivalent to a 1st level human. 

[Ability Scores -2 CP, High Pedhétl +2 CP, Small Size +5 CP, Hardy +1 CP = -2 + 2 + 5 +1 = 6 CP, Social Disadvantage 3 BP, Literal-Minded 1 BP, Total 6 - 4 = 2 CP, ECL 0)

[H3] Racial Traits

Tinalíya characters have the following racial traits.

Strength: Tinalíya are weak, with a -4 racial penalty to Strength.

Constitution: Tinalíya are small and rather fragile, and have a -4 racial penalty to Constitution.

Dexterity: Tinalíya are quite dextrous, having a +2 racial bonus to Dexterity.

Intelligence: Tinalíya are a little smarter than humans, with a +2 racial bonus to Intelligence.

Willpower: Tinalíya are strong-willed, and have a +2 racial bonus to Wisdom.

Charisma: Tinalíya do not understand humor or fantasy, and so find it hard to understand or get on with other species. They have a -2 racial penalty to Charisma.

High Pedhétl: Tinalíya have a base Pedhétl of 6. 

Small Size: Tinalíya are Small in size. This grants them a +1 bonus to all attack rolls, a +4 bonus on Hide checks, and a +1 bonus to Defence Value.

Hardy: Despite their rather fragile appearance and susceptibility to injury, Tinalíya are more resistant to disease, poison and many other hazards than their small size might suggest. They have a +2 racial bonus to all Fortitude saving throws and Constitution checks.

Second-Class Citizen (Nonhuman): Tinalíya are nonhumans, so can never be full participants in Tsolyáni life. A Tinalíya’s relative status, reflected by its Lineage and Wealth, does not go far in human society.

Literal-Minded. íya have great difficulty understanding or communicating almost any non-literal concepts, however good they might otherwise be with language. A Tinalíya has a -4 penalty on all Sense Motive checks relating to humans or any other race that uses humor and non-literal speech.

**Chapter 4 Feats, Skills, Character Classes**

Tinalíya are usually best suited as Experts (usually scholars or bureaucrats) or Sorcerers, since their literal-mindedness can be something of a boon in those character classes. Despite their size, they do quite commonly become warriors, too (Legionaries or Scouts), and make a success of that work.

[H3] Languages

Tinalíya know the Tinalíya language and one human language (usually Tsolyáni). They have a strong accent, though this does not significantly interfere with communication.

[H3] Naming

The following are examples of Tinalíya names.

[END CHART]

H1] Chapter 4: Skills, Feats, and Flaws

Unless otherwise noted here, all the standard skills and feats from the _Player’s Handbook_ may be selected and used as normal.

[H2] Skills

Unless otherwise noted, all the usual skills can be learned, with the usual restrictions on cross-class skills. 

[H3] Unsuitable Skills

The following skills are unsuitable for _Tékumel d20_ games:

Ride, Spellcraft.

[H3] New Skills

The following new skills are introduced.

[H4] Bribe (Charisma)

You know who to bribe to get what you want, how much to offer, and most importantly how and when to offer it so it will not be taken as an insult or embarrassment to the character being bribed.

Check: A Bribe check can be used to get a result you want from a character who does not much care either way but would prefer to baulk you so as to follow procedure (DC 15). It is considerably more difficult to Bribe someone who actively desires not to assist you (DC 25+). The GM should determine the amount of bribe required asking you to roll. On a failed check, you must attempt a Diplomacy check (same DC as the original Bribe check) to avoid causing offence. On a successful check, you may bribe the character with an amount suggested by the GM, or you may choose not to do so without loss of face.

Synergy: If you have five or more ranks of Bureaucracy, you gain a +2 bonus on all Bribe checks. If you have five or more ranks of Sense Motive, you gain a +2 bonus on all Bribe checks.

[H4] Bureaucracy (Intelligence)

Description: Paperwork features heavily in administration work and there is a lot of “red tape.” Regulations must be followed, goods and resources accounted for, and appropriate respect shown to higher-up bureaucrats. A character with this skill knows how to work the system — filing paperwork, calling in favours, and sweet-talking his or her superiors. In the event of an emergency where a character has not followed policy and protocol, this also helps cover his or her tracks and avoid any possible disciplinary action or dishonour. 

Check: The DC is at the GM’s discretion, but the following guidelines apply:

|Situation|DC|
|---|---|
|Doing a perfectly legitimate action more quickly.|15|
|---|---|
|Making a close call look perfectly legitimate.|20|
|---|---|
|Obtaining a Favour from a superior for something that is otherwise unavailable (note that this count as a Minor Favour owed as normal).|25|
|---|---|
|Covering for a colleague who has flagrantly violated procedure and been caught.|30|
|---|---|

Synergy: If you have five or more ranks of Bribe, you gain a +2 bonus on all Bureaucracy checks.

[H4] High Cartography (Intelligence)

High Cartography is the skill of creating and interpreting the carved gemstones used as detailed and compact maps by the ancients.

Check: A High Cartography check can be used to make a new piece of High Cartography (typical DC 25+, with at least four weeks of work and highly expensive raw materials) or to “read” another High Cartographer’s creation, potentially revealing a vast quantity of information about the terrain depicted (typical DCs 15 to 30 depending on the subtlety of the information encoded).

Synergy: If you have five or more ranks of Knowledge: Geography, you gain a +2 bonus on all High Cartography attempts. If you have five or more ranks of Navigate, you gain a +2 bonus on all High Cartography attempts. If you have five or more ranks of Craft: Jeweller, you gain a +2 bonus on all High Cartography checks made specifically to create a High Cartography artefact.

[H4] Instruction (Wisdom)

Instruction is the skill of teaching others. This includes both passing on skills (including the Instruction skill) and more specific training such as Teamwork-oriented manoeuvres (see p. XX).

The character with Instruction may teach any skill he or she has, up to a maximum number of ranks equal to either his or her ranks in Instruction or the skill, whichever is higher. Instruction provides no especial benefit if the student has the taught skill available as a class skill. The benefit comes if the student does not have the skill available as a class skill, in which case the instruction enables him or her to buy the skill using only 1 Skill Point/Rank, rather than the usual 2 Skill Points/Rank for cross-class skills.

Instruction takes one full week of work (five days) for both the instructor and the student, for each +1 rank taught. No other work may be carried out during this time period, so income cannot usually be drawn during instruction (unless it is payment for tuition by the student, of course). The maximum class size is 10 - desired rank in skill (minimum one), so that as soon as a character has +9 or more in the skill to be taught, he or she will need to be trained one-on-one.

At the end of the week of instruction, the instructor makes an Instruction check (DC = 5 + student’s desired Ranks in the taught skill), and the student makes an Intelligence check (DC 10, but with a +2 bonus if the instructor has five or more ranks in Instruction). If both these checks are successful, the skill has been taught, and the student may spend 1 Skill Point to increase the skill by +1. It is not possible to Take 10 on Instruction checks.

Note that Skill Points must always be expended when learning a new skill. However good an Instructor you are, you cannot teach someone who is not ready to learn.

_Example:_ Isúra is teaching Sánjesh how to hunt (Survival skill). Isúra has Instruction +8 and Survival +6. Sánjesh, as a Legionary, does not have Survival available as a class skill, and has no ranks in it. His Intelligence is 13 (for a +1 Intelligence modifier). At the end of the first week of training, Isúra makes an Instruction check (DC 5 + 1 = 6), and automatically succeeds (since her Instruction of +8 is enough to do this even with a roll of 1). Sánjesh must make an Intelligence check, and rolls an 11 + 1 (Intelligence modifier) +2 (because Isúra has five or more ranks of Instruction) = 14, gaining Survival +1 for a cost of 1 Skill Point rather than the usual 2 Skill Points. In the second week, Isúra attempts to train her pupil up to Survival +2. This still does not require an Instruction check, because the DC is so low (5 + 2 = 7), but this time Sánjesh only rolls a 6 on his Int check, +3 = 9, not quite enough! The second week is wasted: Sánjesh simply cannot grasp the concepts behind the Survival +2 skill. He may continue training for further weeks in hope of succeeding at the Intelligence check next time, or he can abandon the attempt and stick with Survival +2, or he can bite the bullet and spend a further 2 Skill Points to raise Survival from +1 to +2. Isúra can potentially teach Sánjesh up to Survival +6, but this will require a minimum of five more weeks of training even assuming he keeps making his Intelligence checks and she keeps making her Instruction checks.

[H4] Magic (Wisdom or Intelligence)

The Magic skills may only be learned by a character who has the Magician feat (see p. XX). There are two distinct Magic skills: Magic: Psychic (Wisdom-based) and Magic: Ritual (Intelligence-based). Magic skills are used when casting spells of the appropriate sort. Casting a spell requires a Magic check, with the DC being equal to the Spell Cost (see p. XX). Magic skills are also used to resist hostile magic. More information about all aspects of these skills can be found in the Magic chapter.

[H4] Navigate

The ability to navigate by the stars and sun, recognise landmarks or animal routes, and read maps, including specialised symbolic maps such as tubeway markings but not including High Cartography (see p. XX). The Navigate Skill will help a character find the fastest and safest route to a destination.

Synergy: If you have five or more ranks of Wilderness Tracking, you gain a +2 bonus on all Navigate attempts. If you have five or more ranks of High Cartography, you gain a +2 bonus on all Navigate attempts. If you have five or more ranks of Decipher Script, you gain a +2 bonus on all Navigate attempts that involve tubeway cars.

[H4] Teamwork (Wisdom)

Teamwork is a skill, but is not usually used for making Skill Checks in the ordinary sense. Rather, it provides a pool of Team Points to a team that works together, allowing them to achieve extraordinary results when they act as a unit. For full information about Teamwork, see p. XX.

[H4] Wilderness Tracking

The ability to successfully trail or track someone or something while outdoors in a rural or wilderness setting. In Tékumel d20, unlike other d20 games, the Wilderness Survival skill is split into two skills, Wilderness Tracking (for tracking, only) and Wilderness Survival (for everything else).

Synergy: If you have five or more ranks of Navigate, you gain a +2 bonus on all Wilderness Tracking attempts. If you have five or more ranks of Knowledge: Nature, you gain a +2 bonus on all Wilderness Tracking attempts specifically to track creatures of the animal or magical beast types. 

[H2] Feats Overview

**[H4] Whirlwind Attack**

**Prerequisites: Dex 13, Int 13, Combat Expertise, Dodge, base attack bonus +4.**

**Benefit: When you use the full attack action, you can give up your regular attacks and instead make one melee attack at your full base attack bonus against each nearby opponent (any opponent that the GM considers you to be capable of attacking without having to take a move action to get to them).**

**When you use the Whirlwind Attack feat, you also forfeit any bonus or extra attacks granted by other feats, spells, or abilities.**

[H3] New Feats

The following new feats may be selected by characters in _Tékumel d20_.

[H4] Accuracy

Your attacks are unusually accurate.

Prerequisites: Base Attack Bonus +2

Benefit: You suffer reduced dice penalties when attempting an accurate attack, such as striking at partial Armour, weak points, or vital spots, shooting at longer-than-usual ranges. Accuracy is also used when attempting a special trick shot, such as carving an initial on someone’s body or ricocheting an arrow off a wall to shoot a target around a corner. Each difficulty penalty is reduced by 2 (to a minimum of 0). For example, attacking a vital spot (-8 penalty) would become a -6 penalty, while firing at double range (-4 penalty) would receive -2 penalty. 

Special: This feat is best suited to Heroic Fantasy campaigns. The GM may wish to restrict its use in less high-powered games.

**[H4] Administrator**

**You are a born civil servant.**

**Benefit: You get a +2 bonus on all Bureaucracy and Bribery checks.**

 [H4] Attractive

In Tsolyánu, having an appropriate appearance can be at least as vital as beauty. That is, a character who looks right for their social status and societal niche can sometimes get further than one who is merely physically attractive. Your looks achieve both, a combination you have turned to your advantage on many occasions.

Prerequisite: Charisma 13, Human

Benefits: Select a feature that is particularly attractive. For example: soulful eyes, lustrous hair, a resonant voice, good taste in art, etc. This grants you a +2 bonus to Seduce checks, and lets you attract a number of admirers equal to 5 + your Charisma bonus, as long as you can explain to the GM how you are using your attractive trait (for example, your lustrous hair would need to be artfully arrayed, or if you had a resonant voice, you would need to speak or sing, etc.). These admirers will generally stay around for as long as you pay them attention, though this is not a magical effect, so urgent business elsewhere will usually end the effect.

In addition, you resemble an archetype that is easily recognised in Tsolyái society, such as a "Soft-Spoken Clan Woman", a "Cultured Noble", a "Dour Legionary", a "Religious Zealot" etc. You gain a +4 bonus to Charisma checks and Charisma-related skill checks, so long as you are very deliberately and powerfully acting according to your archetype. Note that having such a strong and well-known persona does mean that you must maintain consistency to it at all costs. You could lose a great deal of face if as Cultured Noble you ever showed a lack of taste, or if as Religious Zealot you tolerated disrespectful behaviour towards your god.

[H4] Biyúrh

You are capable of entering into a berserk state when wounded or severely agitated.

Prerequisite: Páchi Léi race.

Benefit: Any time you are dealt hit point damage by a melee attack, or are personally, directly threatened by at least two armed opponents, you may make a Wisdom check to release your anger into a berserk rage. The base Wisdom check DC is 15, but you gain a bonus on the check equal to the damage you have been dealt so far. If your check succeeds, you may enter a state of biyúrh for a number of rounds equal to 10 + your Constitution modifier, or until you can no longer see any enemies, whichever is first. When in a state of biyúrh, you gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls, but suffer a -2 penalty to Defence Value. Furthermore, while in a biyúrh state, you may not use spells or missile weapons, but must attack the nearest enemy or else move at maximum speed towards any living enemies if none are within range of your melee attacks. You may enter a biyúrh state up to once per day.

[H4] Battle Cry

You are mentally tough, and can channel this into physical resilience by shouting your favorite battle cry or prayer, allowing you to fight on when others would fail. When severely wounded, you work yourself up into a berserk frenzy rather than collapsing and calling weakly for the nearest healer.

Prerequisite: Iron Will.

Benefit: When reduced to zero or negative hit points, you may choose to act as if you were still on positive hit points, rather than disabled or dying. You must make this decision as soon as you are reduced to negative hit points (even if it isn’t your turn). If you do not choose to act as if you were disabled, you immediately fall unconscious.

When using this feat, you must make a full melee attack each round if there is a foe within melee range; if no foe is within range, you must charge the nearest foe. Each round that you act in this way, you sustain 1 point of damage. If you are reduced to -10 hit points by any means, you will die at the beginning of the next round on which you cannot see any enemies, though you may continue to fight until that point.

Normal: A character without this feat who is reduced to between –1 and –9 hit points is unconscious and dying; a character without this feat who is reduced to zero hit points is disabled.

Special: The player should devise an appropriate battle cry or a few words of prayer for the character, and call it to indicate the use of this feat. This invocation should be appropriate to the character’s culture, religion, etc. 

[H4] Blessed

Your supernatural patron has especially blessed you. 

Prerequisite: Cha 15, Lucky.

Benefit: While in the immediate area of influence of the patron (as defined by the Lucky feat) you may add or subtract a +1 bonus or a -1 penalty to any and all die rolls you make. You are also generally lucky and gain a +2 bonus to all Bluff and Sense Motive checks that relate specifically to gambling games.

**[H4] Clan Membership**

You are such an honoured Tsolyáni citizen that you have been permitted to join a Clan, despite your nonhuman nature.

Prerequisite: Charisma 13, Nonhuman.

Benefit: You and the GM should consult together and determine a suitable Clan for your character, based on your race, class, and any other pertinent factors.

Normal: Nonhumans may not join Clans.

Special: Ahoggyá may not select this feat. In the unlikely event that an Ahoggyá expressed a desire to join a human Clan, the Clan would rapidly quash any such desire.

[H4] Close Combat Expert

You have perfected close-combat fighting and groundwork.

Prerequisite: Combat Expertise, Dodge, Int 15, Dex 15

Benefit: You gain a +4 bonus on all grapple attacks or trip attempts.

 [H4] Combat Flyer

You have practised flying in a military context, enabling you to make more effective aerial attacks and fly for longer during the course of the working day.

Prerequisite: Hláka race, Con 11, Dex 11

Benefit: You may fly 150 km per day comfortably, or 250 km per day if you really push yourself. Furthermore, you gain a +1 bonus on all ranged attacks made when you are flying.

Normal: Hláka can fly 100 km per day, or push themselves to fly 200 km per day.

[H4] Concealment

You have an unearthly ability to conceal weapons about your person.

Prerequisite: Sleight-of-hand 4 ranks.

Benefit: As long as you have something to hide the weapons (even if it only long hair or a light robe) your weapons will not be noticed by anything short of an actual physical search, and such a search is conducted at a -8 penalty to the Search check. 

[H4] Crafter

You are good with your hands, capable of creating all manner of practical and ornamental items from whatever materials are available.

Prerequisites:  Int 13. 

Benefit:  You gain a +3 bonus to all Craft checks.

[H4] Dedaratl

You have learned the basics of the unarmed martial arts secrets taught only to dedicated worshippers of Thúmis and Keténgku.

Prerequisite: Int 13, Unarmed Attack 1 rank, Unarmed Defence 1 rank, Priest, must be a worshipper of Thúmis or Keténgku.

Benefit: You may use your Intelligence modifier instead of your Strength modifier to determine damage when making an unarmed attack. This includes any grappling-related attacks, such as Locks and Throws. Likewise, you may make an Intelligence check (instead of a Strength or Dexterity check) if making an opposed Ability Score check when you or an opponent is attempting to Escape from a grapple; you may use your Intelligence instead of your Strength when determining whether one side or the other in a grapple is “much stronger” (see p. XX); and you may add your Intelligence modifier rather than your Strength modifier when Striking to Incapacitate with an unarmed attack (see p. XX). 

[H4] Flunkies

You are accompanied by two servants, toadies, or hangers-on.

Prerequisite: Great Clan _or_ character level 4.

Benefit: Your two flunkies are NPC 1st level characters from the Expert, Entertainer, Merchant, or Laborer classes. They will serve appropriately according to their abilities, but most will only fight in self-defense. Nobles often have this feat, representing the presence of attendants from less well-favored lineages within their clan and lower-ranking client clans. It is also suitable for anyone with an important position in society. Your two flunkies advance in character level so as to remain one-half your own level, rounded down (minimum 1st level).

Special: You may select this feat up to three times. On selecting it for the second time, you gain +4 additional flunkies. On selecting it for a third time, you gain a further +8 flunkies.

[H4] Flyby Attack

Prerequisite: Fly speed.

Benefit: When flying, the creature can take a move action (including a dive) and another standard action at any point during the move. The creature cannot take a second move action during a round when it makes a flyby attack.

Normal: Without this feat, the creature takes a standard action either before or after its move.

[H4] Good Reputation

You have a good reputation.

Prerequisite: Cha 11, Wis 11.

Benefit: Tsolyánu society is quite static, with a strong set of shared values, and so a good reputation can go a long way. The player should choose what kind of “good reputation” her character has, based on the style of the campaign. In some campaigns, a reputation as a “Fair and Just Negotiator” might be more useful than one as a “Fearless Killer”; in others, quite the reverse. A character with a reputation must be prepared to demonstrate it and/or defend it, at any time, particularly if the reputation is especially combative. Failure to do so could result in the loss of the reputation. You are well-known throughout an entire city or province, even by people you have never met. The reputation might be a simple description: “steady” or “expert archer.” Anyone aware of the reputation (which will be most people around you) will react accordingly. Increase your Respect by +10 Points.

[H4] Great Clan

You come from a clan with higher status than normal for the campaign. For Tsolyáni, there is nothing more important than clan, and so this feat can be highly beneficial. However, it can also prove divisive: other characters in the campaign will find it very difficult to associate with you socially.

Prerequisites: May only be selected at 1st level.

Benefit: Your clan is one clan Level higher than the norm for the campaign. For example, if other characters in the campaign are from High Clans, you are from a Very High Clan.

Special: This feat counts for all purposes as two feats — you may only select it instead of selecting two other feats. The GM may restrict this feat within the campaign — consult with him or her before selecting it.

[H4] Greatly Blessed

Your supernatural patron regards you as an especially favored associate.

Prerequisite: Cha 17, Lucky, Blessed.

Benefit: You are notably blessed. Once per game session, the player may suggest a specific event she would like to occur, that could conceivably happen by luck, and then make a Charisma check to see if it works. The DC is 10, 15, or 20, depending on how outrageous the luck is, as defined by the GM.

[H4] Harmony Amongst the Five Selves

You have integrated the five elements of your Self.

Prerequisites: Wis 13, must not have the Shadow Scars flaw.

Benefits: Your shadow-self is fully integrated with your personality. This means you can get good quality sleep even in poor conditions, as well as making effective use of cat-naps. When you waken from a sleep, even a short one, you are immediately alert and at least a little refreshed. If you are ever _fatigued_ for any reason, you may sleep for 15 minutes and make a Wisdom check (DC 10) to wake up fully refreshed. You also have good problem-solving capabilities based on a strong intuition (the GM may allow you to make a Wisdom or Intelligence check if you are confronting a problem, giving you a hint if you succeed). You gain a +1 bonus to Teamwork.

 [H4] Highly Skilled

You have learned a variety of skills.

Benefit: You gain +4 skill points. These are treated exactly like any other skill points.

Special: This feat may be selected more than once. You gain a further +4 skill points each time you select it.

[H4] Huge Build

You are enormous, a giant in Tsolyáni terms.

Prerequisite: Str 13, Con 13, Large Build, may only be taken at 1st level, may not also select the Attractive feat.

Benefit: You gain a further +1 bonus to Initiative checks and a further +2 meter increase in your Movement Speed. You deal +1 damage in melee attacks because of the weight you can put behind blows, and gain a +2 bonus to all Grapple checks because of your greater leverage. On the down side, you require a huge amount of food and water, are a relatively easy target for missiles (opponents gain a +1 bonus on their missile weapon attack rolls against you), and you have a -2 penalty to Fortitude saves to avoid heat exhaustion. Furthermore, any clothing or armor you buy costs +25% more than usual.

Special: The GM may insist that a Tsolyáni character with this feat also has the Ugly flaw, since people of this size are considered unattractive by most Tsolyáni. Alternatively, this is a suitable feat for a N’lüss barbarian character.

[H4] Hu'on

Your dedication to Ksárul or Grugánu, and your long months of hard training, have been rewarded with some of the secrets of those Temples’ ancient kickboxing martial art. 

Prerequisite: Wis 13, Unarmed Attack 2 ranks, Priest, must be a worshipper of Ksárul or Grugánu.

Benefit: You may add your Wisdom bonus to damage you deal when making an unarmed attack, in addition to adding your Strength modifier as usual. This does not apply to grappling attacks, since your training is in kickboxing rather than general martial arts. Furthermore, when you are attacked by any unarmed attack other than a grappling attack, you are considered to have 1 point of Armor.

 [H4] Hu'on Mastery

You have mastered the martial art of Hu'on, and attack in a lethal flurry of kicks.

Prerequisite: Wis 15, Unarmed Attack 4 ranks, Hu'on, Priest, must be a worshipper of Ksárul or Grugánu.

Benefit: If you make a full attack with unarmed strikes (not including grappling), you may choose to make one additional attack at your highest attack bonus. If you do so, you suffer a -2 penalty to all your attack rolls this round.

[H4] High Lineage

Your lineage within your clan is highly prestigious.

Prerequisite: May only be taken at 1st level.

Benefit: As compared to other members of your clan, your social rank and status are high. This will affect every interaction you have within your clan. Ordinary clan members will defer to you as a matter of course. When the clan has a new project or expedition in mind, it looks to you to lead its members. You are also both personally wealthier, and trusted with more clan resources, increasing your Resource Points by +50%. 

Special: This feat is most important in campaigns set predominantly within a given clan. The GM may wish to allow an additional, tangible benefit for a more general campaign, such as a +2 increase to all Intimidate checks, as well as the usual increase to Resource Points.

The GM may allow a character to ignore the prerequisite and select this feat at a higher level, if there are good in-game reasons for such a change of status. Usually this will only occur if the character’s actions have been so well-respected as to alter the status of his or her entire lineage.

[H4] Hlepurdal

You have been especially trained in the use of sword and dagger together.

Prerequisite: Two-Weapon Defense, Two-Weapon Fighting, Dex 15, Melee Attack 4 ranks, Melee Defense 4 ranks.

Benefit: When you are wielding a long sword or rapier in one hand, and a dagger in the other (this must be a standard dagger, not a punch dagger or stiletto), you gain a +1 enhancement bonus to your total Armor, and a +1 bonus to the damage you deal with the weapons.

[H4] Increased Pedhétl

Your Pedhétl, or magical potential, is higher than is the norm for your race.

Prerequisite: None.

Benefit: Your Pedhétl is increased by +2.

Normal: Most humans have a Pedhétl of 4.

Special: You may select this feat up to three times, increasing your Pedhétl accordingly each time you select the feat.

[H4] Large Build

You are considerably larger than most Tsolyáni of your sex.

Prerequisite: Str 11, Con 11, may only be taken at 1st level.

Benefit: You have a long stride and reach, granting you a +1 bonus to all Initiative checks and a +2 meter increase in your Movement Speed. You also gain a +1 bonus to Intimidate checks, and a +1 bonus to Fortitude saves made specifically to resist the effects of poison or drugs. You also require significantly more food and water than an average Tsolyáni, however.

[H4] Legion Training

You have spent some time in one of the Legions, and have learned some of the basic formations and combat techniques of that Legion. Determine the Legion you have joined in consultation with the GM, and also determine if you are still an active member.

Prerequisites: Base Attack Bonus +5, must have signed up as a member of a Legion.

Benefit: You gain Formation Drill and Formation Combat, two class features of the Legionary class (see p. XX). If you already have one or both of those class features, you will instead gain later Formation class features so long as your Base Attack Bonus is sufficiently high — see the descriptions under the Legionary class for more details.

Special: This feat is designed to be cumulative with the Formation class features from the Legionary class, so that multi-classed characters can gain this feat as well as gaining levels in Legionary so as to remain on a par with the other members of their Legion. 

[H4] Local Hero

You did something notably good at some point in the past, perhaps saving a small child from a burning barn or winning a medal in the war. You are something of a local hero, and a large number of ordinary people are well disposed you. 

Prerequisite: Good Reputation, Cha 13, Wis 13.

Benefit: Your reputation has spread to the province around your city, or to the nearest large city to your province. Increase your Respect by a further +10 Points.

[H4] Lucky

You have the attention of some supernatural patron. This may be a god, spirit, demon, etc.

Prerequisite: Cha 13

Benefit: Your patron tends to protect you and make you a little luckier, at least when it is paying attention. You benefit particularly in the immediate area (within 5 + Charisma bonus meters) of a suitably mystical place (a shrine to the relevant god, or a demonic altar, etc.), or just after (within 5 + Charisma bonus rounds) you make a ritual sacrifice to the entity. When you have its attention in this way, you may reroll any natural roll of 1 on any die roll, if you so choose (including skill checks, attack rolls, saving throws, defense rolls, damage dice, etc.). You may continue to reroll until you get a result that is not a 1.

Special: The player and GM should discuss the specific details of this feat. In some cases, the player may be happy to leave the details up to the GM, with the character not yet even suspecting that they have a non-human patron. At the other extreme, the player may want her character to have a demonic pact, and have strong ideas about the pitfalls and benefits of such a dread deal.

[H4] Magic Dampener

Something in your makeup interferes with the drawing of extra-planar energy. You act as a natural dampener to magic of all kinds.

Prerequisites: Iron Will, Wis 13, may only by selected at 1st level.

Benefit: Spells cannot be cast within one meter of the character (friendly or hostile). The character cannot be psychically read or detected, and cannot cast magical Spells of any kind. Magical items that draw upon the user’s energy cannot be used at all within the affected area (by the character or by others). Items that possess charges may be used once within the affected area but must be removed from the area around the Dampener before being able to activate another charge (the next charge will not “load” within the dampened area). The character cannot activate scrolls, books, inscriptions, or other "triggered" enchantments — those that require a psychic "spark" from the reader. Thus, a Dampener can read a scroll but it will not activate but he or she also cannot trigger a sorcerous trap that requires reading.

Special: Dampeners are rare, and the GM should consider whether such a character will be too disruptive to the campaign before approving this feat. Certainly it is reasonable to apply a restriction of one such character per campaign.

[H4] Magician

You have begun the difficult task of learning either Ritual Magic or Psychic Magic

Prerequisite: Pedhétl 6; either Cha 13 _or_ Int 13.

Benefit: Choose either Ritual Magic (so long as you have an Intelligence of 13 or higher) or Psychic Magic (so long as you have a Charisma of 13 or higher). If you chose Ritual Magic, you may now learn the Magic: Ritual skill. If you chose Psychic Magic, you may now learn the Magic: Psychic skill. Note that this feat does not make the Magic skill a class skill if it was not already, but merely enables you to gain the skill at all.

Normal: The Magic skill may not be learned by a character who does not possess this feat.

Special: You may select this feat a second time, so long as you meet the prerequisite for the type of magic you did not select the first time. You may now learn the other Magic skill.

[H4] Multiattack

Prerequisite: Three or more natural attacks.

Benefit: The creature’s secondary attacks with natural weapons take only a –2 penalty.

Normal: Without this feat, the creature’s secondary attacks with natural weapons take a –5 penalty.

[H4] Multiweapon Fighting

Prerequisites: Dex 13, three or more hands.

Benefit: Penalties for fighting with multiple weapons are reduced by 2 with the primary hand and reduced by 6 with off hands.

Normal: A creature without this feat takes a –6 penalty on attacks made with its primary hand and a –10 penalty on attacks made with its off hands. (It has one primary hand, and all the others are off hands.) See Two-Weapon Fighting_._

Special: This feat replaces the Two-Weapon Fighting feat for creatures with more than two arms.

[H4] Overbearing Attacker

Through a combination of strength and skill, you have developed a fighting style that revolves around using maximum force against your enemy, knocking their weapons flying or knocking them right out of your way as necessary.

Prerequisite: Combat Expertise, Power Attack, Int 15, Str 15

Benefit: You gain a +4 bonus on all attempts to disarm an opponent, and on all overrun attempts you make.

[H4] Performer

You are a virtuoso performer in a number of different performance styles, with that quality of excellence mingled with exhibitionism that can make a truly world-class performance artist.

Prerequisites:  Cha 13. 

Benefit:  You gain a +3 bonus to all Perform checks.

[H4] Priest

You have passed the examinations required to become a Priest or Priestess of the 1st Circle devoted to your chosen deity.

Prerequisites: Knowledge: Religion 4 ranks, plus either Wis 13 _or_ Int 13 _or_ Cha 13.

Benefit: You gain Ritual (chosen deity) (Int) as a class skill. This remains the case whatever your class may be or become. In most cases, you will also gain more respect from other worshippers of your chosen deity, as well as higher pay than a non-Priest, assuming that you work for your Temple in some capacity (typically as an administrative priest, scholar priest, ritual priest, or Temple guard). You may choose not to work directly for your Temple, but simply to be a lay priest, in which case you are free to roam and adventure as you will.

[H4] Promotion: Imperial

You have received a promotion to a rank two circles higher than you had before.

Prerequisites: Administrate 4 ranks, Int 13, must work for the Imperium in a civilian role (usually as an Expert: Bureaucrat).

Benefit: Increase your rank by +2 circles. Your income will usually increase too (see p. XX).

Normal: Most characters have to work to gain promotions, acquiring higher ranks through in-game achievement.

Special: This feat may be selected more than once. Each time it is selected, your rank increases by +2 circles. If your rank is already 10th Circle or higher, you may not select this feat.

[H4] Promotion: Military

You have received a promotion to the rank higher than the one you had before.

Prerequisites: Knowledge: Military 4 ranks, must work for the Imperium, a Clan, or a Temple in a military role (usually as a Guard, Legionary, or Scout, but sometimes as a Sorcerer, Expert, Noble, or other class).

Benefit: Increase your rank to the next highest rank. Your income will usually increase too (see p. XX).

Normal: Most characters have to work to gain promotions, acquiring higher ranks through in-game achievement.

Special: This feat may be selected more than once. Each time it is selected, your rank increases to the next highest rank. If your rank is already Kási or higher, you may not select this feat.

[H4] Promotion: Temple

You have received a promotion to a rank two circles higher than you had before.

Prerequisites: Priest, Cha 13.

Benefit: Increase your rank by +2 circles. Your income will usually increase too (see p. XX).

Normal: Most characters have to work to gain promotions, acquiring higher ranks through in-game achievement.

Special: This feat may be selected more than once. Each time it is selected, your rank increases by +2 circles. If your rank is already 10th Circle or higher, you may not select this feat.

[H4] Psychic Mesh

You have trained as a highly specialized telepathic communicator, able to send and receive psychic messages across continents.

Prerequisites: _Ascertainment_, Wis 15, Magic: Psychic 12 ranks, Teamwork 12 ranks.

Benefit: You may learn the _long range telepathy_ Spell Specialization of the _ascertainment_ spell, paying the usual cost in Spell Points to do so. See the spell description for more details (p. XX). This capability is so scarce and highly valued that you will also almost certainly receive some kind of promotion, assuming that you work for a Temple or for the Imperium (typically +1 Circle, though this is entirely at the GM’s discretion).

Normal: Characters without this feat can never learn the _long range telepathy_ Spell Specialization of the _ascertainment_ spell.

[H4] Renowned Hero.

You are spoken of throughout Tsolyánu as a true hero.

Prerequisite: Good Reputation, Local Hero, Cha 15, Wis 15.

Benefit: Your reputation has spread throughout the Empire. This is appropriate for a war hero or a member of the local community so upstanding as to be spoken of even beyond his or her home. If your character has not yet done remarkable deeds within the context of the game, you must develop a reasonable back story in consultation with the GM to justify this. Increase your Respect by a further +10 Points.

[H4] Retainer

You have a retainer or bodyguard — an almost constant companion who is extremely loyal and protective.

Prerequisite: Great Clan _or_ character level 4.

Benefit: Create a character to be your retainer. The retainer may be of any character class and is created according to whichever rules are in play for creating player characters. The retainer will be two levels lower than your level (minimum 1st level). A retainer will never be of higher social standing than you, but could be of equal clan status.

[H4] Scholar

Book-learning comes easily to you, and you remember almost everything you have read.

Prerequisites:  Int 13. 

Benefit:  You gain a +3 bonus to all Knowledge checks.

[H4] Skein of Destiny

The Tsolyáni believe that everyone has a destiny, and some features of it may be divined (by astrology, for example). Any major Temple can have a divination performed, but it is easy for your character to be unaware that he or she has this feat.

Prerequisite: At least one Ability Score 15

Benefit: You are destined to die violently. This may not seem like much of an advantage, but it does mean that you cannot be killed by non-violent means. You may be injured, crippled, scarred, hideously maimed, or put in a coma, but you cannot be killed except by violence.

[H4] Small Build

You are quite small and slim.

Prerequisite: Dex 13, _maximum_ of Str 16 (or 2 points below usual racial maximum, if nonhuman), must not also have the Large Build feat, may only be selected at 1st level.

Benefit: You have the small, slim build commonly associated with dancers and acrobats. You are a harder target for missile attacks (-1 penalty to all ranged attack rolls against you). You also have an excellent power to weight ratio and so are able to use either your Strength modifier or Dexterity modifier for Climb and Jump checks, whichever is higher. Finally, you require slightly less food and water than an average Tsolyáni. 

[H4] Special Item

You own an extraordinary, and perhaps even magical, object. You might have inherited it as a family heirloom, found it in an ancient tomb, looted it from an enemy, or even stolen it.

Prerequisites: May only be taken at 1st level.

Benefit: The special item you own is considerably more powerful or unusual than would be expected for someone of your background. This feat is best suited to a Heroic Fantasy campaign (see p. XX); the GM may wish to restrict or even ban it in other campaigns. You gain 75 Resource Points to spend on the item; these points cannot be spent on anything else. Resource Points gained from this feat cannot be increased by the Wealth or High Lineage feats or reduced by the Low Lineage or Poor flaws. See Designing Special Items, page xxx, for info on the resource costs of creating a special item. You and the GM should discuss and agree on the manner in which the item came into your possession.

Special: This feat may be selected more than once. You gain +75 Resource Points to spend on the item each time, allowing you to acquire an even more valuable item.

[H4] Spells

You have had a chance to learn some additional spells, and perhaps some new Specializations within those spells.

Prerequisites: Pedhétl 4, Magician.

Benefit: You gain +20 Spell Points (see p. XX). You may spend these on new spells as usual.

Special: You may select this feat more than once, gaining +20 Spell Points each time.

[H4] Tiny Build

You are very small and slim.

Prerequisite: Dex 15, Small Build, _maximum_ of Str 12 (or 6 points below usual racial maximum, if nonhuman), must not also have the Large Build feat, may only be selected at 1st level.

Benefit: You have the perfect build for an acrobat (+1 bonus to Tumble and Hide checks). You are small enough to be a harder target (in addition to the -1 penalty on any ranged attacks against you, as gained from Small Build, attackers also have a -1 penalty on melee attacks against you). You require only half the food and water of an average Tsolyáni.

 [H4] Water Tolerance

For some reason, you do not have the (eminently sensible) fear of water exhibited by most Pé Chói. Perhaps you have deliberately trained yourself to tolerate short exposures to water, or else you are naturally fearless with regard to immersion.

Prerequisites: Race: Pé Chói, Wis 13.

Benefit: You do not have the Water Phobia racial trait. Furthermore, you gain a +4 bonus on Concentration checks to keep your spiracles closed.

Normal: Most Pé Chói have a phobia of water, and this causes them to panic — and usually to drown_._

[H4] Wealth

Your family is considerably wealthier than is typical for its status. Often a relatively low-status clan can be quite wealthy, due to good luck, careful management, or simply its presence in one of the largest, richest cities, such as Béy Sü, Jakálla, or Avanthár. This will not help with your reputation or social status, but money can buy most other things.

Prerequisites: None.

Benefit: Multiply your Resource Points by 2.

Special: May usually only be selected at 1st level; may be selected at a later date only with the GM’s special permission. This feat may be selected a second time; multiply your Resource Points by 2 again, for a total multiplication of x4.

[H4] Wild Empathy

You have a particular way, or knack, with animals.

Prerequisite: Cha 13, Animal Affinity

Benefit: You may improve the attitude of any animal or magical beast. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person. You rolls 1d20 and adds your character level and your Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals and magical beasts are usually unfriendly. To use wild empathy, the you and the creature must be able to study each other, which means that you must be within 10 metres of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing a creature in this way takes 1 minute, but as with influencing people, it might take more or less time. Any attempt to use this feat to influence a magical beast is done at a -4 penalty.

[H3] Flaws

**The following flaws may be selected by characters in _Tékumel d20_. A character may select up to two flaws. Each flaw selected allows the character to select an additional feat. Flaws may only be selected at 1st level.**

[H4] Addicted

Addiction on Tékumel is not inherently stigmatized, but it can lead to ignoble action, if not kept under some kind of control. You might be addicted to drugs, alcohol, risk, gambling, sex, violence, or just about any activity possible. You have a constant need to partake in this activity, irrespective of your conscious desires.

Penalties: The character is severely addicted. He or she must make a Will save to resist temptation every five minutes of exposure, beginning at DC 15 but with the DC increasing by 5 for each five minutes. A DC 15 Will save is also required if the character wishes to stop indulging in the drug, unless something extreme (being attacked, lack of ready funds, unconsciousness) stops him or her first. Additionally, the character must spend 25% of all skill points on skills related to directly or indirectly to the addiction (GM's discretion). A character with this flaw may not select the Iron Will feat.

[H4] Arrogant

You are arrogant far beyond your actual status and capabilities.

Penalties: You are arrogant and over-confident, feeling that you are considerably more capable and impressive than you really are. Pick an Ability Score or Skill that you believe is +4 higher than it actually is. Furthermore, any loss of Respect doubled, since you are so sensitive to your actual inferiority. You are frequently boastful, which may lead to all kinds of problems, including unwanted arena challenges if you boast of martial prowess. A Will save (DC 15) is required to avoid some idiotic confrontation each week; for a less combative character, this could be an intellectual falling-out with another scholar or priest, or an argument over trade. A character with this flaw may not select the Iron Will feat.

[H4] Bad Reputation

At some point in the past, you acted ignobly or dishonorably. Even now, people remember your shame, which is a constant burden. Any time you must prove your worth, doing so will be considerably more difficult than it would be for most.

Penalties: Your disgrace is well-known, and it would take repeated demonstrations of heroism and indisputable honor before you might start to be forgiven. You begin play with one full negative Level of Reputation.

[H4] Clumsy

You are often distracted when performing minor physical tasks, and so become clumsy. Fortunately you are able to remain focused when in combat.

 Penalties: You have a -2 penalty on Dexterity-based skill checks and Reflex saves when not in combat. You regularly embarrass yourself with minor but very noticeable acts of clumsiness. Your friends watch you warily whenever you pick up a sword, knowing you are liable to trip over it, accidentally stab yourself, or drop it on their toes at any moment. You may not select the Lightning Reflexes feat.

[H4] Debts of Honor

You owe large Favors to one or more major NPCs, far beyond the typical Favors owed by someone of your social class. Perhaps you owe them your life, or they saved you from total social disgrace at significant cost to their own reputation. They may call on you to repay these Favors at any time. Once the Favors are repaid, the GM may assign you a different Flaw to replace this one.

Penalties: You owe eight Medium Favors, four Big Favors, and one Huge Favor (see p. XX).

[H4] Fragile

You may be sickly, or simply psychologically unsuited to the pains and rigors of everyday life, but either way you are significantly less tough than most.

Penalties: -1 penalty to starting Hit Points, and a -2 penalty to all Fortitude saves. A character with this flaw may not select the Great Fortitude or Toughness feats.

[H4] Greedy

You desperately covet wealth and possessions of all kinds, even to the point of committing crimes to get your hands on them.

Penalties: You must succeed at a Will check (DC 20) to resist any such opportunities to acquire wealth or valuable objects, whether to do so would be dishonorable or not. You are particularly willing to be bribed (DC 25 Will check).

[H4] Impulsive

You have very little control of your emotions.

Penalties: You are flight and emotional, and must make a Will save to resist provocation of any kind. You are not really interested in others’ emotions, taking a -2 penalty on all Sense Motive and Gather Information checks. If you are under great stress, the GM may specify which emotions your character is feeling, and you must roleplay accordingly. You must make a Will save (DC 15) to resist openly displaying whatever emotion you feel at the time. A character with this flaw may not select the Iron Will feat.

[H4] Indecisive

You often find yourself near-paralyzed by indecision.

Penalties: You find it hard to make your mind up, frequently freezing up during combat or other stressful situations. You have a -2 penalty on Initiative rolls, and a -1 penalty on Defense rolls. A character with this flaw may not select the Improved Initiative feat.

[H4] Low Lineage

You are from a low-status lineage within your clan, with less access to clan wealth and other privileges. You are rarely given positions of power or command.

Penalties: Your Resource Points are multiplied by 0.5.

[H4] Low Pedhétl

The character has a lower than average ability to store magical energy. The main effects on a non-spellcaster are to reduce the character’s ability to resist spells, and reduce the effectiveness of benevolent magic.

Penalties: The character’s Pedhétl value is 1. He or she has a -1 penalty on all Will saving throws against spells. Any benevolent spell cast on him or her is cast with a -4 penalty on the Magic check. A character with this flaw may not select the Magic or Increased Pedhétl feats.

[H4] Minor Clan

Your clan is of a lower status than those of your comrades.

Penalties: Your clan is one clan Level lower than typical clans in the campaign. For example, if everyone else belongs to Medium clans, you are a member of a Low clan. You may not select the Great Clan feat, and may never gain levels in the Noble class.

Note: This flaw counts as two flaws in all respects, that is, it is the only flaw the character may take, but taking it grants two feats rather than just one.

[H4] Nemesis

The character has a personal enemy, rival, or other entanglement who regularly causes difficulty. The Nemesis may be an enemy trying to harm the character, a rival in love, a business competitor, etc.

Penalties: The nemesis is an enemy who causes significant problems on a regular basis. This person is not necessarily hostile, but his or her goals conflict with those of the character. The nemesis will have higher status than the character, and will be one character level higher than the character at all times.

[H4] Physical Impairment

For most Tsolyáni, medicine is a primitive affair; physical impairment is not uncommon among the lower clans. Higher-clan people are more likely to have access to magical healing, and are thus less likely to have this flaw. A veteran of the legions, however, may have an amputated limb after infection, while occupational accidents for farmers, sailors, and artisans are common. The Game Master should consider the availability of healing magic in his or her campaign before allowing a player to assign this flaw, ruling that the injury is incurable by magic. The examples listed below are not exhaustive; others are possible.

Penalties: The character is seriously disabled. This effectively precludes a large range of actions and makes others extremely difficult (-4 penalty). For example:

[BEGIN BULLET LIST]

Blind: This prevents normal reading, makes traversing unfamiliar territory difficult, and makes combat next to impossible. The character automatically fails Spot checks, and has a -4 penalty to all Search checks or other checks for which vision would be an advantage.

No legs: The character can, with difficulty, use arms to pull him or herself along. His or her Movement Speed is reduced to 25% of normal.

Paraplegic: The character is paralysed from the waist down.

[END BULLET LIST]

[H4] Poor

Characters with this Defect come from a family, or clanhouse, that is poorer than average for its status. This usually means the character is from a rural area or small town, where everyone is poor by city standards (for campaigns set in a remote rural area, the GM may wish to assign this flaw to all characters). This does not affect the character’s social standing.

Penalties: Multiply Resource Points by 0.25.

[H4] Responsibilities

The character has important responsibilities that affect his or her life, resources, and free time.

Penalties: The character must be on call regularly and cannot travel freely. For example, a soldier on active service must travel with his or her unit, take turns at sentry duty, and may have to fight. This leaves little room for independent action. Cross-class skills may not be learnt. This flaw is not usually permitted in campaigns in which all characters have similar commitments by virtue of the campaign set-up, such as a military campaign in which all characters are members of the same Legion.

[H4] Clanless

The character is Nakomé (clanless).

Penalties: The character is regarded as scum by “decent” Tsolyáni standards. He or she may be a foreigner, or simply an outcast. He or she has a -4 penalty to all Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks relating to anyone who does have a clan and who knows him or her to be Nakomé. For humans only (most nonhumans have a similar disadvantage already).

[H4] Shadow Scars

The character has some form of injury to his or her incorporeal shadow-self. A common source of this is intense trauma, like the shock of battle wounds. To the Tsolyáni, this is as real as physical damage. Recognition and treatment are available for it within medical and magical systems. For characters with this flaw, however, these scars will never heal.

Penalties: Choose either Amputated Dreamlife or Waking Echo. A character with this flaw may not select the Iron Will or Harmony Amongst the Five Selves feats.

Amputated Dreamlife. The character has lost his or her capacity to dream, finds it difficult to stay asleep, is easily disturbed (which is occasionally beneficial), and wakes up too early in the morning. Unless the character sleeps in near-perfect conditions, he or she suffers the effects of sleeplessness, imposing a -2 penalty to the following skill checks: Concentration, Craft, Disable Device, Knowledge, Listen, Magic, Move Silently, Perform, Pick Lock, Profession, Research, Spot, Wilderness Tracking. This penalty increases by -2 per day until he or she receives a decent night’s sleep.

Waking Echo. A specific common experience (such as the sight of weapons, or the smell of damp grass), if combined with any stressful conditions (imminent combat, anxiety, or pain) triggers a Shadowscape even if the character is awake, unless he or she succeeds at a Will save (DC 20). This usually paralyses the character for several minutes while he or she runs through the harrowing Shadowscape. The character feels exhausted after awakening.

[H4] Ugly

This Defect describes a character who does not fit the Tsolyáni ideal of beauty. 

Penalties: The character is either outright ugly or has a physical trait that is disturbing to the Tsolyáni (such as blue eyes, thought to indicate a curse by the Goddess Avánthe). The character suffers significant prejudice if the flaw is visible, involving at least a -4 penalty to Charisma-based skill checks and Charisma checks relating to other Tsolyáni. While blue eyes are easier to conceal than simple ugliness, they also provoke far worse reactions (children with them are often killed at birth).

[H4] Child

Characters generally begin the campaign at age 20 or so, and their starting capabilities reflect that. Characters with this flaw begin the campaign as children.

Penalties: The character is approximately 12 years old — a child by Tsolyáni law and custom. He or she has a -4 penalty to Strength, though his or her Strength will increase by +1 per year for the next four years as full adult potential is achieved. Furthermore, adults will not take the character seriously, and he or she has a -2 penalty to all Charisma-based skills until achieving the age of majority (15). A character with this flaw may not also select the Toughness or Highly Skilled feats

Abilities, Skills, & Renown 5e

# Additional Feats

## Feat: Formation Fighting

This represents 2 or more people attacking in a formation from fighting shoulder to shoulder, back to back, or to sophisticated military tactics (shield wall, a square, etc.).

When a character with this skill goes in formation with another person with or without this skill, it allows the character to go on the initiative of the character with the lowest initiative order. Also, the character can do one of the following as a bonus action:

- Distract: giving the other person advantage on their next attack roll.
- Defend: give +2 to AC and Dexterity saving throws until the start of the characters next round.

## Feat: Out-Maneuver

In combat warriors are taught to find tactical advantage as they may. When a character hits with an attack, they can use a bonus action to do one of the following:

- Reduce an opponent’s initiative by 4. The opponent’s initiative cannot be reduced below 1.
- Disengage from combat.
- Dash as a bonus action.

## Feat: Teamwork

The ability to work together with others as a team. This allows for both military and social event coverage and allows the following:

- You can use the Help action as a bonus action. The ally must be within 5 feet of you.
- You gain 3 Teamwork d10 dice. As a reaction, you can use a Teamwork dice to assist someone within 30 feet of you. On that turn, the dice can be added to a Ability, Skill, Initiative, Attack roll, or Saving throw. The dice must be used by the end of your next turn. You gain all your dice back after a long rest.

## Feat: Dedaratl

You have learned the basics of the unarmed martial arts secrets taught only to dedicated worshippers of Thúmis and Keténgku.

You may use your Intelligence modifier instead of your Strength modifier when making unarmed attacks. This includes any grappling-related attacks, and checks. Likewise, you may make an Intelligence check (instead of a Strength or Dexterity check) if making an opposed Ability Score check when you or an opponent is attempting to Escape from a grapple; you may use your Intelligence instead of your Strength when determining whether one side or the other in a grapple is “much stronger”.

## Feat: Hu'on

Your dedication to Ksárul or Grugánu, and your long months of hard training, have been rewarded with some of the secrets of those Temples’ ancient kickboxing martial art.

You may add your Wisdom bonus to damage you deal when making an unarmed attack, in addition to adding your Strength modifier as usual. This does not apply to grappling attacks, since your training is in kickboxing rather than general martial arts.

Flurry of Kicks: : If you make a full attack with unarmed strikes (not including grappling), you may choose to make one additional attack, but you cannot move this round.

## Feat: Knowledge of the Ancients

You have learned how to read bits and pieces of the Ancient language and can use the computers and systems of the Ancients. You gain the following skills: **_Computer Use; Vehicles: Aircar; Repair._**

**_Computer Use (Intelligence)_**

_This skill cannot be used untrained_

By the time of the Ancient’s star empire, computers have reached sentience (the Ru’un is an example). Of course, after the cataclysm when survival was paramount, computer literacy dropped dramatically. Probably by the time of the Empire of Llyán, computer use was an guarded secret of the few. Computers may be found in ancient ruins and in a few temples (as a closely guarded secret) and probably as well guarded state secrets. This will also allow the character to reprogram ancient robots such as the Ru’un. More than likely only priests of Thúmis and Ksárul will even know of the existence of computers, but training is possible as the character rises in circle.

DC Task

20 Modify existing programs

25 to 35 Create New programs

30 Break Into Secure Systems

+5 Complex Systems

**_Vehicles: Aircar_**

_This skill cannot be used untrained_

The most common (though still exceedingly rare) ancient vehicles left are the aircars. As a rule of thumb DCs for piloting are 10 for low-speed turns and rolls, 15 for half-loops or long rolls, 20 for tight turns or loop and turn, 25 for bootlegger turns or hand banks, and 30 or more for high speed jumps or slides past an obstacle.

**_Repair (Intelligence)_**

_This skill cannot be used untrained_

The most likely object that needs to repaired are the eyes. Simple repairs have a base DC 15 to 20 and complex repairs of DC 25 or more. The character needs the proper tools or the DC is increased by +5. Tools are themselves rare and would probably be found in the possession of a priesthood or the Tinalíya.

# Skill Descriptions

## Etiquette

**(Intelligence) (Alternatively, corresponds with your highest Renown score)**

Courtly etiquette is crucial for a Tsolyáni aristocrat; people are quick to take offence, and there is little of the rough-and-ready sense of humour that characterises European and American societies.

Etiquette in the five empires is perhaps the most important skill, it covers the proper form of dress for an occasion, the right way to say 'you' to a person, recognizing clan, religion, and legion signs, etc.

Your Etiquette always corresponds with your Social Status, as one cannot rise in Social Status unless they know the proper Etiquette for their station.

To recognize proper situations, use the appropriate Int check (arcana, history, nature, or religion)

To address others using the appropriate etiquette, make a relevant Cha check (deception, performance, or persuasion).

**Méshqu**

These are patterned plaques which a Tsolyáni will hang outside his door to indicate his mood or state of health to callers. A dozen different Méshqu are used by the middle classes. Nobles display their greater refinement by using almost two hundred different Méshqu!

A failure in Etiquette by the caller means he has misinterpreted the Méshqu, with potentially amusing or mortifying results.

# Skills by Ability

Just use the appropriate Ability check or Skill check, do not actually ad these skills to a character. Anyone born within one of the five empires will have Etiquette as a skill so characters can add their proficiency bonus to any checks.

Skills that are **emboldened** are common skills mentioned in other EPT resources.

# Factions and Renown

The Empires are a mass of factions, each requiring loyalty and service. Characters must learn to manipulate and work within the confines of these factions, and when a job needs to be done that’s in odds of for some of their factions, the person must figure out how their loyalties tie together. The most common factions each character is apart of are:

- The Empire to Tsolyani
- Their Clan
- Their Temple
- National, State, and City renown and other bureaucratic institutions
- Military legion
- Political organization
- Secret society

Characters gain Renown within each faction, depending upon deeds performed for the benefit of each. In many instances, the character's faction rank allows for advancement in their Circle and\or Title\Rank for determining political and economic position(s).

Characters can also lose renown through serious offences. More about gaining, losing and the effects of renown are in the Dungeon Master's Guide (DMG p.22).

**Military Rank**

Gaining ranks within the Military can be slow in combat roles (except during times of war) compared to the Priestly and Governmental Circles. However, people working in support roles such as administration, intelligence, logistics, supply, etc. can move up the ranks faster but the work is far less glorious.

**Priestly Circle**

People within temples can generally expect to gain a Circle around every two years, depending on one's level of work and success. Circle’s in the temples do not always come with a title, authority or responsibility, as positions are fairly scarce and any move or change in position comes with contention and political manoeuvring. Priests can not only gain in circles but also in title and offices, which can be both a reward, and curse depending on the situation.

In most cases, anyone from Low or Very Low clan cannot advance beyond Priest, regardless of age or service to the temple.

Scholar-Priests must also complete a “Work”; a dissertation or other formal academic proposition that is reviewed by a committee of senior scholars, for each Circle the Scholar-Priest wishes to attain.

**Government Circle**

Circle advancement within the government follows along much like within temples, but each circle comes with additional responsibility and authority. Positions with actual authority are harder to attain, and positioning within the government is highly political and at times, dangerous. It would be extremely difficult for anyone higher than the eighth circle to adventure because of the constant daily responsibilities.

**Clan Rank**

Clans have few ranks, so advancement is slow.

People who add to a clans Respect, Resources, or money (including business ventures), will gain more clan renown and with that, better access to clan resources in the future.

**Circle**: Circles are Ranks within Priestly and Government orders. Commonly someone must be a certain circle to attain a title. Circle can also correspond with character level (or NPC level).

**Renown**: This can be used in different ways. 1) the character must gain and maintain this amount of renown to attain a Circle rank; 2) this is the amount of renown a character has from their Title and Circle (if Circle is used to corresponds with level).

**Titles**: Titles come with circles and positions within the Empires. And with changes in position and titles comes a change in pay and privilege. As a general rule, lower circle/title positions must follow the direction of their superiors within their organization.

There are many other titles and positions than what is listed here. Some of which are secret.

**Military**: Military rank is used for legions, police, crypt & temple guards, and any military organization.

**Temple Priests**: Temple priests, Administration, Ritual, Scholar, and even Lay-Priests use these titles.

**Magic Users**: Any magic-user, even temple priests who use magic, can use these titles

**Government Offices**: There are a large number of government positions and offices. The ones listed are more of an example.

**Skilled Professionals**: There are three types of profession:

**Plebeian**: skills of ordinary craftsmen and artisans.

**Skilled**: skills crafts requiring greater study and experience. When determining Social Status add +10 renown for being in a Skilled Profession.

**Noble**: skills requiring considerable study and work. The acquisition of these skills is usually restricted to children of nobility, and the priest-schools. When determining Social Status, add your Clan status a second time.

**Salary** (Kitars per month): the amount of your wages could be in a large city based on your Title and Circle.

## Social Status

Status is a complex issue whose nuances cannot be quantified by rules. However, the most visible manifestations of status (what dais you sit on, etc) can indeed be quantified. Social Status gives a way of measuring this, and it derives from three basic factors:

1. Clan and lineage, and seniority within the clan [Your renown within your clan].
2. Renown in one professional circle (in a profession, temple, legion, or the bureaucracy).
3. Public honour and local renown (or infamy).

**Combine all relevant Renown earned to determine a number for one's social status**.

This gives an accurate indication of where he would be seated at a grand banquet, how she would be addressed by someone acquainted with her provenance, etc. It does not provide any definite guide to his influence in society, which will be crucially affected by others factors including inducements, public honours, contacts and patrons.

In circumstances where a person’s exact lineage and provenance are not known, he is treated solely on the basis of clan — or office, if he is clearly of high rank in temple, legion or bureaucracy. The same applies in irregular social interactions. (This means that it is appropriate for someone of low lineage within a noble clan, say, to refuse a challenge from another of high lineage in a medium clan, even though the latter may technically have higher Social Status. Shámtla payments are awarded entirely on the basis of Social Status, however, and so the young noble in this example may find that his clan-elders would prefer him to take the duel!)

A group of people with the same status need not have arrived at it in the same way. One of them might belong to a prosperous lineage in a medium clan, another to a less important lineage in a noble clan, while a third might be of peasant stock and owe his status to a brilliant career in the Civil Service.

Just because two characters have the same Social Status, it does not mean they are equal. Class in Tsolyánu is far too complex to be accurately expressed with just a single number. Jorúne hiMektésh, an elder of the Black Stone Clan, will still indicate a certain deference in speech and manner towards a scion of the noble Clan of Sea Blue, though their nominal status might be equivalent.

### Social Ranks

The nation of Livyanu to the southwest uses tattoos called aomuz to specify caste and rank and religion and shoe size and wine preference, in a pattern and code which has never been interpreted by any other nation except that the more one has the more important one seems to be. This is due in large part to the fact that the nation is very secretive -- you cannot travel in Livyanu outside the Foreigner's Quarters (more like a Foreigner's Compound) without an encyclopedic collection of authorization papers. If you try, the all-encompassing Vru'uneb (secret police) will definitely catch you and kill you.

Tsolyánu has no such coding for social ranks. The only distinctions are subcultural: the Vriddi are proud and arrogant with a distinctive beak-like nose (what would be called a "Roman nose"). They are Vimúhla worshippers and delight in tracing their lineage back 20,000 years to the Empire of Engsvan la Gánga, which gets boring after a while but is their basis to claim that THEY ought to be running the Empire. (Do NOT point out to them that if they were so clever then why'd half of it get sunk in the ocean. They HATE that.) Other such cultural hallmarks exist, but are not of major import.

**[H1] Chapter 5: Equipment and Economics**

[H2] Handling Money

The GM should determine the best way to handle finances in your _Tékumel d20_ campaign, probably in consultation with players. Many groups prefer not to have to keep track of every last hlásh that every character acquires or spends, though that approach can certainly work. For example in a low-status campaign that revolves around an economic and literal fight for survival,  every hlásh really does count – so it makes sense to even count every qirgál, because it could make the difference as to whether or not the character eat that night. Likewise, in a campaign that revolves around a merchant clan's trading trips, it makes sense to keep close track of finances.

For a campaign that is more about high-status characters (who regard money and bills as somewhat beneath them, anyway), it may be best for the GM to simply allow each player to have access to whatever resources seem reasonable, based on their status and wealth (taking account of their Clan, and if they have it, the Wealthy feat). If they want access to especially high-cost items, those might need to be purchased through their clans, with the clan retaining ownership of it.

The Access to Clan Resources rules (p. XX) can be used as a middle ground, allowing the GM to assume that characters will have status-based expenses and status-based income that more-or-less balance out, at least while at home, but perhaps requiring the players to keep more careful track of coinage while on adventures.

[H2] Tsolyáni Currency

Though iron is rare, and thus, staggeringly valuable, on Tékumel, more terrestrially valuable metals are not quite so scarce. Thus, the currency is based around small coins of gold, silver, and copper. The gold coin is the 3-gram káitar. A káitar is worth 20 silver hlásh, with each hlásh worth 20 copper qirgál

[BEGIN CHART]

Coin Material Quantity per káitar

káitar gold 1

hlásh silver 20

qirgál copper 400

[END CHART]

Low Clan Tsolyáni may never even see a  káitar up close, and rarely or never handle a single hlásh. On the other hand, High or Very High clanmembers actively prefer not to know about money, or precisely how wealthy they are, thinking that such concerns are beneath them. Thus, they may never see anything smaller than a  káitar, and even regard such gold coins as rather vulgar. Such nobles expect their servants to deal with all financial matters.

Clanhouses offer banking facilities, and most  Tsolyáni make use of them, rather than carrying a great deal of cash with them. For transporting large sums from one place to another, the practical solution is to either carry a draft from one's clanhouse treasury, or simply convert the cash to high-value, low-bulk gems, which can be resold on arrival.

[H2] Access to Clan Resources

All clanmembers, of however lowly a status in however lowly a clan, have access to equipment and other resources from their clan storehouses. A Tsolyáni's first thought, on realizing the need for a particular item, would not be "where can I buy it?" but "does my clan already own one that I could borrow?" Table X-X: Access to Purchases (page xxx) gives a good indication of what kind of things a character could get access to, depending on their starting Resource Points. A Wealthy character (see p. XX) comes from a richer clanhouse, and thus has access to more or better resources. Note that however wealthy or high-status one is, generally, a small, poor, rural clanhouse may simply not own the same resources as one's usual home clanhouse (though in most cases, the rural clanhouse administrators will try their hardest to fulfill any requests from such visiting nobles, for the sake of honor). Likewise, even a poor clanmember may be able to gain access to more resources than usual when visiting an especially rich clanhouse, even allowing for a certain amount of suspicion of the "poverty-stricken yokels" on the clanhouse administrators' part.

Access Value

If a character wishes to use clan resources, follow this procedure:

Take the item's worth in káitars

Divide this worth by the character's Resource Points. This determines the Access Value of the item. 

If a character has a negative Reputation, an item's Access Value increases by one category for each level of negative Reputation. Conversely, a positive Reputation decreases the item's Access Value by one category per two levels. The GM can increase the category if a character has irregular finances, particularly if the clan quartermaster suspects them of keeping money back from the coffers. Likewise, if the character is in the clan elders' bad books for whatever reason, the Access Value category may increase.

[[ITALIC]]Example: 

Elechu has 50 Resource Points. He needs a physician's bag (80 káitars). For Elechu, the physician's bag has an Access Value of 1.6 (80 ÷ 50 = 1.6). As this is between 1 and 2, he can have the bag, so long as he explains exactly what it is for, and agrees to return it after use. If he had one level of negative Reputation, he would effectively have an Access Value of 2 to 5, and thus would probably only get the physician's bag if on clan business (and would need to account for every bandage and ointment he used in the process).[[ITALIC]]

[BEGIN CHART]

Table X-X: Access to Purchases

Access Value Description of Access

up to 0.25 Unlimited personal use. You do not need permission for this item, and the quartermaster probably doesn't even make a note that you have taken one.

0.25 to 0.5 Near-unlimited personal use. Again, the quartermaster doesn't question you over your need for it, but might start to notice if you regularly started taking several of them.

0.5 to 1 Limited personal use. You would need to demonstrate a specific need for the item. The quartermaster probably wouldn't try too hard to verify the facts of your need, but would certainly take a note of your loan of the item, and would expect to see it back eventually, in good condition. 

1 to 2 Very limited personal use. Again, you would need to prove a need for the item. The quartermaster will pay attention to your request, considering it carefully and possibly making specific investigations as to the veracity of your supposed need. You would be expected to return it as soon as your need was over, and might be given a specific time limit for its use. It would need to be returned promptly and in good condition.

2 to 5 Limited clan use. You would need to prove that not only did you need the item, but that your having it would provide a specific benefit to the clan. It must be returned intact as soon as your task is over, or as soon your task stops benefiting the clan.

5 to 10 Very limited clan use. This item will only be issued as part of a clan project, rather than a personal one. The clanmaster and clan elders must be aware of, and approve of, the project. It will be made clear to you that the clan retains full possession and ownership of the item at all times; you are not so much being loaned it, as being made temporary custodian of it for the good of the clan.

10+ GM's discretion only. Again, this would only be issued as part of a clan project, and the clan elders would want to ensure the PC was closely supervised throughout. If it is issued at all, it is unlikely to be issued to a single clan member; rather, an entire group must take responsibility for its safe and prompt return.

[END CHART]

Clans do vary in the equipment they have available, and will not, of course, be able to loan out anything they do not possess! Unusual or rare items, particularly magical or steel items, may be totally unavailable, unless the clan specializes in dealing with such things. 

[H2] Income and Expenses

Most characters will have some kind of monthly income, and all will have regular monthly expenses, even if living in clan accommodation.

[H3] Income

Income varies according to character rank, skills, social status, and location.

Income and expense figures are listed in káitars, unless otherwise specified.

[H4] The Professions

Anyone with an official position, such as a government official or priest, will receive pay based on Circle Rank (or military rank, for those who are members of a Legion in any capacity). At lower ranks, these salaries are quite poor, but clans are often willing to assist characters in such positions, in the hope of later repayment in influence once the characters are of higher rank.

[H5] The Government

Government salaries are given in Table X-X, but can be considered a starting point, only. The figures given assume a large city; reduce by 10% for a smaller city or large town, or 25% for small-town or rural areas. A character who is willing to accept bribes may earn considerably more, depending on the precise nature of his or her work.

[H5] The Priesthood

Priest salaries are the same as those of government officials (again, refer to Table X-X), at least for Ritual Priests. Administrative Priests are paid a little more (+5%). Priests in Cohorts are paid less (-10%), and any other priests not listed above are also paid less (-5%). The priest salary scale does not apply to temple guards, who are paid according to their military rank (see Table X-X).

[END TABLE]

The salaries in Table X-X apply to members of Legions. Temple Guards are regarded as more prestigious, and so are paid more (+10%). Other guards and police are generally seen as less prestigious, being paid considerably less (10% less for Sákbe Road Guards, 15% less for Militia and Tomb Police, and 50% to 70% less for town or village constables, depending on the size and wealth of the settlement).

[H4] Clan Employment

Those who work for their clan are generally paid according to how skilled they are (measured in Skill Ranks), the status and perceived value of their profession (usually dependent on clan level), and the location he or she is working in.  

Table X-X: Profession Salaries

Monthly Income by Skill Ranks (káitars)

High elite professional (Sorcerer's Bodyguard, Clanmaster) 7.5 15 25 50 100 200 400

The GM should feel free to adjust theses figures to between 50% and 200% of the values given in Table X-X, depending on the wealth and size of the clanhouse in question.

For Legionaries, use whichever is highest from the following: Attack Bonus (including Base Attack Bonus, plus the highest of Str and Dex bonus), Teamwork ranks, Knowledge: Military ranks.

For Guards, use whichever is highest from the following: Attack Bonus (including Base Attack Bonus, the highest of Str and Dex bonus), Knowledge: Religion ranks, Spot ranks.

[H5] Self-Employment

Those who are self-employed will find their income varying randomly each month, depending on the relative success or failure of their business at that point. Their base income is the same as that found in Table X-X: Profession Salaries. This is then modified based on a skill check (roll on Knowledge: Business, Knowledge: Nobility, or Appraise, whichever is highest). Refer the result of the skill check to Table X-X: Modified Income.

Check Result Modified Income

4 or less No income (-100%)

5 to 9 -70%

10 to 14 -30%

15 to 19 No modifier

20 to 24 +20%

25 to 29 +40%

30 to 35 +60%

Etc. Etc.

Merchants take even larger risks; do the same thing, but modify the result as follows:

Check Result Modified Income

4 or less No income; instead, you make a loss equivalent to 1d6 x 100% of your income. If you cannot pay, and your clan will not bail you out, you will be sold into slavery.

5 to 9 No income (-100%)

10 to 14 -50%

15 to 19 No modifier

20 to 24 +40%

25 to 29 +80%

30 to 35 +120%

Etc. Etc.

[H4] Investment

It is always possible for a character with surplus money to invest in business ventures, property, caravans, etc. Usually it is expected that they will invest this money in their clan's various enterprises, though this is certainly not a strict requirement. 

Broadly, each investment opportunity can be divided into Low Risk, Medium Risk, and High Risk categories, whatever the nature of the business. Prior to investing, a character may make an Appraise check (DC 15) to determine how risky the venture is.

Each month, whichever character is managing the investment makes a Knowledge: Business skill check, then cross-checks the result with the riskiness of the business on Table X-X to determine how much is gained or lost that month.

Table X-X: Investment Results

Check Result Gain or Loss

Low Risk Medium Risk High Risk

4 or less No gain; you lose your initial stake, too, as a merchant venture goes bust or your clan makes a very poor business decision.

5 to 9 Loss of 10% Loss of 20% Loss of 30%

10 to 14 Loss of 5% Loss of 10% Loss of 15%

15 to 19 No gains or losses

20 to 24 Gain of 5% Gain of 10% Gain of 15%

25 to 29 Gain of 10% Gain of 20% Gain of 30%

30 to 35 Gain of 15% Gain of 30% Gain of 45%

Etc. Etc. Etc. Etc.

Of course, the GM may modify the check as appropriate. For example, characters who become directly or indirectly involved in a particular business venture (perhaps dealing with the bandits who have plagued the clan's caravan route for many months), the GM may give a significant bonus or penalty to the skill check.

[H3] Expenses

Every character will have a monthly expenses tally, based on food, dependents, staff, taxes, etc.

[H4] Basic Expenditures

Basic monthly expenses are worked out according to the character's income. Status is so vital in Tsolyánu society that characters will find their expenses increasing as their income does, just so that they can maintain the lifestyle expected of their status.

Most characters will live in clanhouses. Doing so costs 50% of income, to cover food, lodging, and other monthly expenses. It costs 45% if living in a barracks or temple situation, but 60% if living in private accommodation. 

Merchants may subtract half their Haggle percentage (if any) from their living costs. A high-income character spends proportionately less on expenses (5% less for a monthly income over 100 káitars; 10% less if over 500 káitars).

Dependents increase expenses by 5% per spouse (assuming they are not working), or 1% per child under 12.

[H4] Income Tax

Assess a further 1% off all characters' incomes to account for income tax. Cheats are likely to be punished severely.

[H4] Servants and Slaves

Any character who has servants or slaves must pay further costs for them: wages for servants, or upkeep costs for slaves. Paid members of staff expect wages according to their skills and social class, as found on Table X-X: Clan Employment (see p. XX). 

Slaves cost around 3% of their purchase price, every month, to keep them clothed, fed, and generally happy. 

A servant or slave being underpaid will tend to perform poorly and grudgingly, or even leave (attempt escape, in the case of a slave), in extreme circumstances. Of course, a character wishing to reward or encourage exceptional service can always pay more.

[H2] Weights and Measures

_Tékumel d20_ uses the metric system. Tsolyánu weights and measures are a little different, and are provided here for additional flavor.

[END CHART]

[H2] Items and Prices

Prices here are in káitars, unless noted to the contrary. They are a guideline, based on average prices for average quality goods in typical marketplaces; the GM may alter them according to any unusual factors that may apply, such as the quality of an item (well-made or antique items costing 200% or more of the list price; badly made or second-hand items, as little as 50% less), local variations (for example, chlén-hide items may be cheaper in an area that has a great many chlén), etc. 

As ever, Merchants may subtract their Haggle percentage, if any. A character wishing to spend a little time (10 minutes minimum) turning on the charm in the hope of a slight discount may make a Diplomacy check to get a discount (DC 20 for a 5% discount; DC 25 for 10%; a failure to meet at least DC 15 may mean the stallholder takes an active dislike to the character).

[H3] Weapons and Armour

Tékumel has very little iron. The need for something hard and durable to make into armor and weapons has led to the development of chlén-hide, from the chlén-beast. Thick layers of this hide can be harvested twice a year without injury to the chlén, then softened, carved, molded, and hardened. All the processes in turning  chlén-hide into its hard, metal-like final form are secrets, guarded carefully by the tanner clans. Chlén-hide weapons and armor do not last so long as steel would, nor hold such a sharp edge, but they are significantly lighter (around 1/3 of the weight of an equivalent steel item). Chlén-hide may shatter in use, and are not repairable, so it is important to carry several spares even on a short campaign. 

The Tsolyáni love of decoration means that chlén-hide is rarely seen in its dull greyish state, but is lacquered or painted in a variety of bright colors according to the owner's clan, religion, and personal style.

Steel weapons and armor are very scarce. The small quantities of iron found are soon bought up by rich, high-status temples or legions to turn into steel arms and armor for their own use, and are rarely available for purchase by private individuals. 

All prices given in Table X-X assume chlén-hide (or, occasionally, bronze, which is in every way equivalent to chlén-hide in game terms). On rare occasions when steel items become available on the open market, they sell for at least 100 times as much as the equivalents in chlén-hide or bronze, even for the most corroded, rusted old iron sword. A well-made item, with a known history and a reputable manufacturer, could sell for up to 5,000 times as much as the chlén-hide or bronze equivalent.

Asterisked items are not usually made from steel, since non-metal equivalents are easily available and equally good. For example, bows, crossbows, and weapon shafts are generally better when made from wood.

[H4] Custom Weapons

Chlén-hide is easy to carve and mold prior to the hardening process, allowing Tsolyáni chlén-hide crafters to create quite unusual and exotic weaponry. See the Designing Special Items rules (p. XX) for more info.

[H4] Weapons and Armour for Non-humans

Non-human characters will need specially made weapons and armor, since human-made items will not fit or suit them (at least a -4 penalty on relevant rolls or checks, at the GM's discretion; some items may be simply unusable by some species). Specially made weapons are available at the listed price, so long as the non-human character goes to a crafter of his or her own species. Otherwise they will cost double.

NB: An incendiary fire-pot is essentially a primitive incendiary grenade. A thin-walled clay pot is filled with flammable materials, then lit before being thrown (or hurled in a staff-sling). Each pot weighs 2 kg.

[H4] Armour

Ordinary soldiers are usually issued with chlén-hide armor (typically low to middling quality, depending on the legion or temple), but may purchase better quality armor if desired. Even units that possess steel armor do not issue it to soldiers except when immediate battlefield use is anticipated, since it is so scarce and valuable. An officer of  Heréksa rank or higher is expected to buy his or her own suit of armor.

The hot climate makes long-term armor use uncomfortable and potentially even dangerous (heat exhaustion is a real risk, particularly for characters in heavy steel armor, so characters not expecting imminent danger tend not to wear it. Dress uniforms are typically made to resemble armor, but offer little or no actual protection (see Clothing, p. XX, for prices for this ceremonial "armor"). Civilians do not tend to wear armor unless their profession is violent or dangerous.

1 Flask of oil (for lantern). The flask is made of glass or clay, and thus is quite fragile. The oils or fats used for light burn slowly and not very fiercely, making them almost worthless for war or incendiary purposes. Weight: 750g (including 500g oil).

0.9 Spike,  chlén-hide or bronze, 30-40cm long, suitable for climbing.

5 Tinderbox. This contains flint and steel, and has room for dry tinder. Even the tiny steel rod included in this kit makes it something of a luxury item.

55 Backpack, leather, large (holds around 30 liters).

5 Belt pouch, leather, small (holds around 0.25 liters).

2 Waterskin, leather, 2-litre. This is enough for one person's daily needs, assuming non-extreme conditions. Weighs 2.5kg full.

80 Physician's bag, leather. This has a variety of bandages and other dressings, curative herbal preparations potions, salves, and drugs. It can be used to treat a variety of injuries and diseases, as well as a few well-known poisons. Weighs 8kg

6 Cookpots. This includes a medium-sized pot and a skillet, both intended to be hung from a traveler's pack. Weighs 2kg. 

2 Traveling rations, 1 week. This is a mix of hard cheese, dried fruit, nuts, and seeds, capable of feeding one person for one week. Weighs 4kg.

[H3] Clothing

[ITALICS ON]One cannot look at the throng in a crowded street without automatically identifying most of its members: the demon mask and rich purple robes of a Priest of Hrü’ü; the red and black chequered kilt and short vest of the merchant from Katalál; the naked slave, bronze collar glinting at his throat; the clan-girl from the western provinces, her poncho-like tunic of fine fírya-cloth open at the sides from shoulder to calf and belted in at the waist with a cord woven in her clan colours; the high noble in his complicated pleated kilt, bejewelled vest, and transparent over-tunic of thésun-gauze; the peasant from the centre of the Empire, attired in a rough homespun kilt and leather buskins; the lady of fashion, dazzlingly white skirts almost touching the ground, her breasts rouged and tantalisingly concealed beneath a collar of starched and lacquered chlén-hide, golden chains and pins artfully arranged in her long hair; the gilt and scarlet armour of a soldier from one of the legions devoted to mighty Karakán; the hurrying scribe, nude to the waist, knee-length kilt stained with hnéqu juice, and painted wooden penbox clacking at his side … the world-wise city merchant learns to recognise them all…”

Off-duty priests wear civilian outfits appropriate to their class and status. Lay priests can borrow such outfits from the temple as necessary.

5,000 Priest of Circles 11-up: More fancy ritual robes incorporating braiding, complex patterns, lush fabrics, precious metal, etc. Again, priests will need suitable civilian clothing too. In the unlikely event that a lay priest would need such garb, she could borrow it from the temple.

250 Soldier, Tirrikámu to Kási: Ceremonial uniform and armor. Soldiers will also need civilian wear appropriate to their class. Characters who are only loosely attached to legions, or who are in legions that rarely need ceremonial armor, may simply be able to borrow a suit from the legion as necessary.

5,000 Soldier, Dritlán or above: Ceremonial uniform and armor. These will be made from precious metals, or at least shiny and fancy materials.

[END CHART]

[H4] Individual Garments

Those non-humans who do not wear clothing, but use straps, baldrics, webbing, harnesses etc. to carry equipment, can buy such items for around 1-10 káitars in most big cities.

[BEGIN CHART]

[H4] Ceremonial Forms of Dress

Ceremonial dress comes in a variety of ever-more-elaborate versions depending on the status and position of the character. Each Form has a very specific style of ceremonial dress, which can be purchased at a cost of 1000 káitars per rank or character level. 

 **[H3] Precious Metals, Gems, and Jewellery**

Jewelry on Tékumel has similar uses to elsewhere, in that it can be a display of personal status and social class, or a useful, portable form of wealth. It is also favored for giving gifts and bribes of all kinds, being seen as far more appropriate than hard currency. 

To determine the value of an item of jewelry, take the basic cost of the metals and gems involved, then add the labor costs of having goldsmiths and gemcutters work on the piece (typically adding 20% to 200% of the original cost, again, depending on the complexity and skill involved). If it is to be bought retail, the merchant may add another fee on top (anything from 20% to 50% or even more). An antique piece may be slightly or considerably more valuable (another +10% to +1,000% added to the cost, depending on provenance, fame of jeweler, quality, and era). 

[H4] Metal Ingots

Metal ingots may also be used as currency.

[H4] Gems

A beautiful array of gemstones can be found on Tékumel. Table X-X: Gem Costs lists types of gem with typical prices for 1-carat stones. A flawed or discolored stone may be worth only 70% to 90% of the value given, while a perfect gem might be worth twice as much.

Note that for stones categorized as "precious" or above, significantly larger gems cost significantly more, due to their rarity. As a guideline, multiply the base price by the square of the number of carats; for example, a 7-carat black pearl (usual cost for 1 carat = 60 káitars) will cost 60 x 7 x 7 = 2,940 káitars. This does not apply to the cheaper stones, which can generally be found in larger pieces.

The prices given are for uncut gems. A cut stone will be worth at least twice as much, depending on the quality of the workmanship.

[H4] Beverages

Non-alcoholic drinks are usually sold by the mug (around 0.6 liters), whereas alcoholic drinks are sold by the bottle (2.7 liters).

[BEGIN CHART]

Table X-X: Beverage Costs

Article Price Particulars

A'ásh 3 káitars This is a rough, grain-based alcohol, popular among the lower classes. It is commonly found in Úrmish and Katalál. The most powerful blend is known as  Jékw, and is produced in Yán Koryáni.

Chumétl 16 qirgáls This is non-alcoholic beverage of savory Hmélu buttermilk is drunk by every social class throughout Tsolyánu, Yán Kór, Salarvyá, and Mu’ugalavyá. It is salted and heavily spiced, with the precise recipe varying enormously depending on region and social class. Ahoggyá hate it.

Dátsu 6 káitars This robust dlél-fruit brandy is purple-red in color. The Kráa Hills varieties are particularly prized, as are vintages from northeast of Khéiris in Mu’ugalavyá, or the Nuférsh and Kakársh regions in Livyánu. A high-quality bottle might cost 50-100 káitars.

Drónu 12 káitar Drónu is a dark-colored dessert wine made from urtsé berries. A top-quality bottle from Koylúga or Jaekánta could cost up to 100 káitars.

Faóz 6 hlásh This simple rice beer is common in Livyáni, particularly among the working class, but rarely found elsewhere.

Héngka  5 hlásh This wheat or dná beer is found everywhere, but usually regarded as suitable only for commoners. Héngka can be used as a generic term to refer to other relatively weak alcoholic drinks.

Lás 2 qirgáls Lás is an infusion of tíu tree leaves, favored in the north and northeast, and drunk hot. Some add milk, sugar, or salt, depending on region and personal taste.

Másh 10 káitars This is another brandy, though generally better-regarded than dátsu. It is sweet and gold-colored, with a delicate yet exotic flavor. A bottle of the best could cost 100-500 káitars.

Ngálu 5 káitars Ngálu is a common wine, found in all the Five Empires and the surrounding area. A top-quality bottle from a particularly favored vintage could cost 50 káitars or more.

Tsuhóridu 90 káitars This is any one of a variety of swamp liqueurs, made from the crushed seeds of ferns. As well as the usual alcoholic effects, many varieties of tsuhóridu can have other properties, thanks to strange compounds in the seeds, including addiction, hallucination, partial paralysis, paranoia, heightened sexual urges, etc. A particularly fine quality tsuhóridu could cost as much as 1,000 káitars per bottle, but would more usually be sold in tiny cups. 

Tuór 24 qirgáls This is a sweet, sherbet-like drink beloved in Livyánu and some regions of Mu’ugalavyá, where it is drunk by all classes of society, with the most expensive varieties (up to 50 káitars for a small cup) being flavored with exotic herbs and spices.

[END CHART]

[H4] Drugs

The common social drugs of  Tsolyánu and nearby are typically consumed in clanhouses, or occasionally in public premises hosted by clans specializing in preparing drugs and herbs. Typical prices per kilogram are given on Table X-X: Drug Costs, though these prices may vary: a person buying only a few grams for personal use will of course pay proportionately more, and costs per kilogram can be considerably lower if drugs are bought in the regions they are produced.

Pygmy Folk and Hláka are affected by the listed drugs in the same manner as humans. For most other non-humans, these drugs have no particular effects, though Shén are badly affected by Chümaz (which is a dangerous poison for them) and Ntó (which turns them psychotically angry).

Inevitably, some of the non-human species have their own drugs, such as  Fssá roots for Shén and mmuókh bark for Páchi Léi.

[H3] Buildings and Land

It is normal in the Five Empires to live in one's clanhouse, or perhaps in one's quarters at a temple or barracks if a priest or soldier, though occasionally individuals will wish to buy or rent more private accommodation.

[INSERT EXAMPLES OF TSOLYANI BUILDING LAYOUTS]

[H4] Buildings (Rental)

It can be difficult to find suitable buildings for rental, since the practice is relatively unusual. Assume a 25% chance per week of finding an appropriate dwelling for rent. This can be increased to 30% by hiring a  merátokoi agent (fee = 50% of the monthly rental, once found).

Table X-X gives monthly rents for various dwellings, assuming a location within the walls of a large city. Reduce the figures by 25% for a small city or town, and by 40% for a village or rural area.

[BEGIN CHART]

Monthly Rent (káitars) Notes

9 hlásh One-room hovel; no sanitation or cooking facilities.

6 Small house/shop: around three rooms plus a stone courtyard, bathroom, and kitchen; simple dirt or tiled floors.

19 Medium-sized house or shop: four or so rooms, plus a stone courtyard, bathroom, and kitchen; possibly a small garden; stone or tiled floors.

125 Large house or shop: as above, but with around a dozen rooms. Some rooms may be rented out to subtenants, who cannot usually be evicted due to the vagaries of Tsolyáni law.

500 Minor mansion or small clanhouse: a fancier version of the above, with perhaps two dozen main rooms plus servants' quarters. It may have either an attached garden, orchard, summerhouse, and/or roof garden, depending on the availability of land in the area. 

1500 Major mansion, minor palace, or large clanhouse: a still more complex and elaborate version of the above, with around 80 rooms plus servants' quarters, various gardens and minor outbuildings, workshops, storehouses, etc.

12,000 Major palace, or extremely large clanhouse: as above but comprising several main buildings containing hundreds of rooms, house temple, impressive gardens, several outbuildings, etc.

 [END CHART]

[H4] Buildings: Construction and Purchase

Costs and time needed to erect an edifice of one's own are adjudged by the GM. The availability of

workers and materials, the location (city, suburban, rural, or wilderness), the willingness of the Imperium to

have such a building at that location, etc. must all be taken into consideration; it is unusual for the Imperium or clans to sell land to private individuals, too. An engineer-architect is required for any building project, and permission to build must be obtained at the Palace of the Realm nearest the site at a cost of 2d6 x 1000 áitars. If older buildings are to be torn down to make way for the new construction, the permission of the Imperium is mandatory: the usual cost of 2d6 x 1000 áitars, plus 2d6 x 1000 áitars in bribes. As an example, a smallish palace could be constructed in a vacant urban area of Jakalla for about 100,000 áitars (plus the costs mentioned above). A fortified mansion would cost 150,000-200,000 in the same place, though it is illegal to fortify private dwellings without Imperial permission (at least 4d6 x 1000 áitars in bribes, unless there is a genuine need). These buildings would cost about 75,000 and 125,000 áitars respectively if built in the suburban areas outside Jakalla's walls, and they would be still cheaper in a rural area, if stone quarries were nearby, and if there were a sufficient labor force in the neighborhood. A small stone castle might be built in the mountains north of Boy Sy for about 250,000 áitars, while the same fortress in the jungles of Cháka would cost double this sum, due to the lack of stone nearby and the paucity of laborers. Buying an existing mansion, palace, or fortress is somewhat cheaper and easier to do. There is around a 30% chance per month of a suitable building becoming available, at a purchase price anywhere from 50,000 to 600,000 áitars, depending upon the building's size, richness of design and furnishings, proximity to the mansions of important personages, etc. A building outside Jakalla would cost less, and one in a rural area still less, and purchase prices will go down similarly. Ruined buildings can also be restored, once the land is purchased or rented from its present owners, or obtained in fief from the Imperium . In certain areas where the central government is weak, occasional ruined fortresses and other buildings may be found which can simply be taken by "squatter's rights" and rebuilt. Costs, rentals, etc . must be judged by the GM, since it is impossible to give a hard and fast rule. Money can be borrowed from the moneylenders to be found at the Palace of the Realm in any large city. A Diplomacy check (base DC 15) will govern the lender's willingness to loan the money, at a monthly interest rate of 2d6%. Such loans must be paid back within three months (the usual time, under ánlaw); otherwise the debtor will be seized and sold as a slave.

Once acquired as slaves or employees by a player, the statistics and operation of the nonplayer character are turned over to his control, and he or she is expected to maintain the nonplayer character, pay for his or her

needs, and keep his or her record sheet. The Imperial slave markets contain those miserable persons who have lost face with their clans, debtors and indigents, minor criminals (spared by some whimsically lenient judge), miscellaneous foreigners, and a few nonhumans .

Assassination gear cannot readily be purchased on the open market, so prices are not listed. These items can generally only be acquired through Assassin Clans or specialist Imperial units.

[H4] Collar of Forever

A garrotte, made from copper wire (or less often from plant fibers), for stealthy sentry elimination. Requires Exotic Weapon Proficiency: Garrotte.

[H4] Deliverer from Existence

 This is a flat throwing knife, often carried in sets. The name can be given to any throwing knife, though the assassin's version is typically designed to be disguised and concealed inside another object, such as a scroll case or part of a suit of ceremonial armor. Requires Martial Weapon Proficiency.

[H4] Pa’iya’s Kiss

A Pa’iya’s Kiss is a glass bottle with a handle, designed to be thrown and thus deliver a poison, corrosive fluid, incendiary powders, etc. It can be thrown (Martial Weapon Proficiency) or hurled in a sling (Simple Weapon Proficiency). 

[H4] Summoner upon the Way

This is a small pistol-grip crossbow, usually used to shoot poison darts. Requires Exotic Weapon Proficiency: Summoner upon the Way.

[H3] Poisons, Acids, and Antidotes

Most poisons found on Tékumel need to be ingested to be effective. Only a small number (the venoms) can be used on weapons, and only one (Sagún spores) is effective when breathed in. Note that the inorganic and vegetable poisons can be bought from apothecaries and alchemists in major cities, though the various animal venoms are generally only available from assassin clans or official sources (such as the Azure Legion).

When a character takes damage from an attack with a poisoned weapon, touches an item smeared with contact poison, consumes poisoned food or drink, or is otherwise poisoned, he must make a Fortitude saving throw. If he fails, he takes the poison’s initial damage (usually ability damage). Even if he succeeds, he typically faces more damage 1 minute later, which he can also avoid with a successful Fortitude saving throw.

One dose of poison smeared on a weapon or some other object affects just a single target. A poisoned weapon or object retains its venom until the weapon scores a hit or the object is touched (unless the poison is wiped off before a target comes in contact with it). 

Any poison smeared on an object or exposed to the elements in any way remains potent until it is touched or used.

Poisons can be divided into three basic types according to the method by which their effect is delivered, as follows.

**Ingested:** Ingested poisons are virtually impossible to utilize in a combat situation. A poisoner could administer a potion to an unconscious creature or attempt to dupe someone into drinking or eating something poisoned. Assassins and other characters tend to use ingested poisons outside of combat.

**Inhaled:** Inhaled poisons are usually contained in fragile vials or eggshells. They can be thrown as a ranged attack with a range increment of 3m. When it strikes a hard surface (or is struck hard), the container releases its poison. One dose spreads to fill the volume of a 3m cube. Each creature within the area must make a saving throw. (Holding one’s breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons; they affect the nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.)

**Injury:** This poison must be delivered through a wound. If a creature has sufficient damage reduction to avoid taking any damage from the attack, the poison does not affect it. Traps that cause damage from weapons, needles, and the like sometimes contain injury poisons.

The characteristics of poisons are summarized on X-X: Poison Costs and Effects. Terms on the table are defined below.

_Type:_ The poison’s method of delivery (contact, ingested, inhaled, or via an injury) and the Fortitude save DC to avoid the poison’s damage.

_Initial Damage:_ The damage the character takes immediately upon failing his saving throw against this poison. Ability damage is temporary.

_Secondary Damage:_ The amount of damage the character takes 1 minute after exposure as a result of the poisoning, if he fails a second saving throw. Unconsciousness lasts for 1d3 hours. Ability damage is temporary.

_Price:_ The cost of one dose (one vial) of the poison. It is not possible to use or apply poison in any quantity smaller than one dose. 

**Perils of Using Poison**

A character has a 5% chance of exposing himself to a poison whenever he applies it to a weapon or otherwise readies it for use. Additionally, a character who rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll with a poisoned weapon must make a DC 15 Reflex save or accidentally poison himself with the weapon.

Every creature within 1.5m of the point where the acid hits takes 1 point of acid damage from the splash.

[H3] Intermediate Technology

Items of Intermediate Technology are scarce, but have been created by unusually skilled, genius-level Tsolyáni crafters, rather than being examples of ancient technology or of magic. They are often assumed to be sorcerous, though.

The Games Master may permit a character (or group of characters) to start out with one of these items, if they have an appropriate background, but it should be costly.

[H4] Examples

[H5] The Far-Seer

The Far Seer was a squarish tube of black Tíu wood, its ends closed with glittering lenses of polished glass, glued into place with ochre Si’u gum … Zaren hi Murudu had developed the prototype at the Monastery of the Sapient Eye in the Chákan forests … Zaren was a rarity: a mechanical genius …Very few Tsolyáni — or any of the people of the Five Empires for that matter — were handy with machines. Sorcery was easier and more reliable!

— M.A.R. Barker, [ITALICS] Lords of Tsámra [/ITALICS]

This 8x magnification telescope is the only known example of its kind; presumably did not have a chance to build any more after making the prototype. 

Game Mechanics: Magnifies distant objects or landscapes by eight times, providing a bonus to Spot checks (as determined by the GM). Easy to operate.

Resource Point Cost: 100

[H5] Fake Eyes

Eyes (see p. XX) are well known, and much feared, so there is some demand for high-quality fakes. These are available in most large cities, though those who make them do not advertise their services. A Fake Eye is visually indistinguishable from the real thing, at least without careful examination at touch range. Of course, it has no effect if the button is pushed. 

Game Mechanics: A Fake Eye provides a +4 bonus to Intimidation checks.

Cost: 30 Resource Points

[H3] Magical Items

Sample magical items are included in the following section, with some background info, so that Games Masters can insert the items carefully into their campaigns.

[H4] Examples

[H5] Emerald of Hagárr of Paránta

Hagárr of Paránta was a notorious pirate and sorcerer, many thousand years ago. He created, or caused to be created, a small number of magical emeralds, which grant the holder the power to control sea creatures. Each emerald holds 100 charges, recharging one charge per day in sunlight. One charge allows the bearer one minute of total control of all non-sentient sea creatures within 20m.

Cost 300 Resource Points

[H5] Ladder of Mríddu the Magician

These magical ladders are famed in legends and tales, featuring in many daring escapades of yore. At least three are known of, though there may be more. Each Ladder of Mríddu is 17m long when fully extended, but is capable of being rapidly folded to a supernaturally small size and weight (a little less than the size of a human fist, with a weight of under 100g). It is, in effect, a sorcerous doorway to a pocket universe, in which most of the ladder is stored when folded.

Ladders of Mríddu are highly coveted, partly for their legendary associations and partly for their practical value to tomb robbers, assassins, spies, etc. Anyone seeing one in action is likely to remember it from the old tales (Knowledge: History check, DC 10).

Anyone frequently seen wielding a Ladder of Mríddu may begin to acquire a disreputable Reputation, at the GM's discretion.

If a sorcerer passes within 10m of a Ladder, the GM should make a Magic: Psychic check on the player's behalf (DC 15) to determine if the character detects the item.

Cost 150 Resource Points

[H3] High Technology: The Eyes

The best-known examples of ancient, high technology on Tékumel are the Eyes. These devices are small spheres of opaque, unknown material, around the size of a human eye and with an iris-like opening. The various types of Eye look more-or-less identical, until activated. 

Some 50 percent of all Eyes have a tiny inscription on the back, written in one of the ancient languages. Eyes with no inscription must be tested - sometimes with unlooked-for results . Once the function of the device has been determined, the GM rolls percentile dice, and the score is the number of charges remaining in the Eye, i.e. the number of times it can be used before it becomes exhausted. Again, some 50 percent of all Eyes have a tiny dial just below their operating stud which indicates charges remaining; the figure shown changes each time the Eye is used . Other Eyes lack this convenience, and the referee must keep track both of his original secret roll and also the number of times the Eye is used.

There is a 5 percent chance that a given Eye will be defective, deteriorated over the long centuries of disuse .

If this is indicated, the GM rolls percentile dice again as follows: 1-50 = the Eye is now completely inactive,-

51-80 = the Eye has only half its indicated charges ; 81-90 = the device has an effect opposite to its normal purpose, or its effect is distorted in some way (referee's option); 91-100 = the Eye explodes, doing 4d6 damage to the user and 2d6 to any character within 3m!

If there is a way to recharge Eyes after use, this is certainly not widely known; most scholars would find it difficult to even open one up to examine it, without catastrophic consequences (successful DC 20 Knowledge: History _and_ successful DC 20 Craft: Jewelry checks to avoid  the destruction of the eye in an explosion as per the previous paragraph).

Eyes were originally designed as tools, not weapons, so can be rather unwieldy. A character will have a -4 non-proficiency penalty when using an Eye, unless he or she has the Exotic Weapon Proficiency: Eye feat. The GM may wish to restrict acquisition of this feat to those who are willing to expend a large number of charges (4d6) with one or more Eyes in their possession.

Eyes often affect an area rather than an individual — targets may attempt a Reflex saving throw to dive out of the way. Eyes that affect individual victims usually require a Will or Fortitude save on the part of the target.

[H4] Examples

The following list is not exhaustive, and the GM may insert other types into the game as he or she sees fit. Also, the saving throws listed are typical ones – a particularly ancient or poorly made Eye may have a lower save, whereas an especially well-preserved or expertly fashioned Eye may have a higher one.

1 . The Abominable Eye of Detestation : This causes 1-12 beings to flee from the user in utter horror and revulsion. It is especially efficacious against undead (-2 penalty on the Will save). It has a range of 12m and a duration of 10 combat rounds. The victim is _frightened_ for the duration, unless she make a Will save (DC 20).

2. The Excellent Ruby Eye : This fairly common device gives the user the power to "freeze" 1d6 beings (Fortitude save negates) . The victim is frozen at the exact moment of time (for him) when he was struck, and no act, thought, etc. can be undertaken while under the influence of this Eye. Another charge of this device is needed to release a victim; no spell, etc. will succeed . This Eye has a range of 15m.

.3 . The Eye of Advancing Through Portals : This Eye projects a force which opens any door, blasts down a wall of rock up to 3m thick, and can create a tunnel 3m long and 1.5m wide through solid rock. It has a range of just 3m, and thus, though it may appear an ideal antipersonnel weapon (a person blasted with it is splashed all over the nearest wall; DC15 Reflex save negates), but the short range renders it a dangerous weapon at best .

4 . The Eye of Aerial Excellence : This permits the user and 1d12 companions or equivalent weight to fly up

to 9m per round for a maximum of 50 rounds per charge . Any comrades or objects picked up must be within a 1.5m radius of the user of this Eye. Any unwilling creature can avoid being picked up with a saving throw (DC 15 Will save negates).

5. The Eye of Allseeing Wonder : This Eye projects a 30cm diameter beam which reveals all invisible objects or

beings, dimensional doors, etc. in its path up to 50m away. It also serves as illumination in the dark. Each charge lasts 10 rounds.

6 . The Eye of Being an Unimpeachable Shield Against Foes : This Eye provides immunity from all bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing weapons (magical or not). Its effects last two turns (20 combat rounds), and up to 1d4 beings can be protected. It has no power against spells, Eyes, or other magical devices .

7. The Eye of Bestowing Life: This Eye immediately revivifies any being slain within the last three weeks. Any small fragment is enough for the Eye to act upon. No rest is necessary before returning to normal activity. There is a 10% chance for the resurrected character to permanently lose 1 point of Constitution. This Eye is rare.

8 . The Eye of Calling Forth an Unconquerable Army: This device contains a force of fighting automata, who can be called forth by expending a charge. These beings are retained by the Eye upon another dimensional plane. Treat them as 3rd level human Legionaries wearing the equivalent of heavy armor and carrying swords and shields (treat as chlén-hide). They remain on this plane for 2d10 combat rounds and then must return to the Eye. The number of automatons called forth on a given charge is determined by rolling percentile dice; there is always a maximum of 1-100 such beings, even if some have been slain previously . These automatons are fighters only and cannot obey other orders (e.g. open doors, search chests, stand guard).

9. The Eye of the Creeping Fog of Doom : This Eye produces a cloud of any gaseous element the user requires. Its settings were known only to the ancients, however, and most of these devices now produce poisonous gases (50 percent chance of inhaled poison gas, with a save of a random DC (2d6+6), initial damage 1 Con, secondary damage 1d8 Con; 40 percent chance of contact poison gas, save of 2d4+6, initial damage 1 Con, secondary damage 1d6 Con; 10 percent chance of some non-poisonous gas, such as oxygen). The cloud is blown out at a speed of 3m per round, and it covers an area 30m square. It lasts 6d10 rounds before dissipating . Beware of wind direction, since the gas can blow back and slay its sender . This Eye must not be used in a confined space either, since the gas requires room to roll out and spread.

10. The Eye of Departing in Safety: This device instantly transports 1d12 beings or equivalent weight to a

predetermined place . It is necessary to focus the Eye first upon the place to which one wishes to return; after this, it automatically carries its load back to that place. It has a maximum range of 100m, and if this Eye is used

without first determining the destination, it transports the user into illimitable darkness from whence there is no returning. Note that this Eye may also be"unset" by simply twisting the stud, if the user changes his or her mind and no longer wishes to be focused upon a previously selected location; this costs no charges.

[H5] Other items

These may be technology of another form or perhaps ‘magic’ instruments, though it should be remembered that any technology may be seen as magic. Power levels as follow- moderate[m], artifact[a] and eldritch [e]in increasing order. Eldritch should always be in cooperation with gm and player storytelling. [note that ‘lead feet’ or opportunities for bad things to happen while used have been applied]

1. 1. the smooth stone. resembling a ‘worry stone’ these small disklike items fit in the hand and are rubbed smooth in the center. if a person with even a modicum of psychic ability rubs the stone while experiencing enough emotion, they will be transported to another place. some of the stones will even return you to your origin point. good luck. [m]
2. 2. the book. these books are filled with glyphs that when used correctly will transport a person to another place and/or time. companions may come if they are touching it. the glyphs themselves possess the power, all one has to do is to follow the patterns correctly. unfortunately the ink and patterns do fade with use. good luck. [m]
3. 3. the ring of the first founder. this item is a left over from the scouts who first landed on tekumel. they possess a limited ‘other dimensional space’ and some have a ‘demon’ within them that allows limited use as a weapon or secure storage facility. typically the person who wears one is healthier, and more alert with aging slowed or stopped.  it is unknown if the demon is a computer [nanites in your body!] or not, whether or not the rings have been tampered with by those of the latter times, or even if the items are indeed from the first founder’s time. they just work. [a]

eg: roll a d6

- 1. by using micro bots inserted into the wearers pores the item reads the mind of and learns the wearers enemies, then provides warning of such enemies within 100 feet.
    2. Opens a small nexus to a Bethorm of Fire, allowing 1 fire spell per charge. Begin with 100 charges, restored @ 1 per day. Wearer must know spell.
    3. Allows storage of items in a Bethorm similar to box of topaz God.
    4. Hauls a dying wearer into the Bethorm, may be back in 1-1000 days fully healed.
    5. Allows many to enter the Bethorm, atmosphere is friendly. May conduct meetings.
    6. Confers invisibility.

1. 4. the sword of Janule. rediscovered well before the death of the last emperor, this sword is purported to be the weapon of the entity that guarded lady avanthe at dormoron plain (as she would not usually fight physically herself). the sword served the empress janule in her rise to power and most recently was quietly readied should the civil war have unfortunate consequences. its powers are simple and brutal. activated only by a prayer to the goddess by a servant of avanthe or dlamelish, the sword takes over its bearer (using nanotech or some other means) and an aspect of the goddess moves forward to battle. a blue glow surrounds the wielder such that they cannot be harmed. things that may activate the sword include technology, fire, ksarul things, undead things, etc. if used on a servant of avanthe or dlamelish the sword becomes like unto swiss cheese and does not harm them. natural beings may be treated in this manner or the sword may be like chlen hide. the sword itself does not do significant damage past the ‘magical steel’ range, so things that are really powerful (I’ve seen it fight a 40’ long serpentine ru’un) are not necessarily harmed by it. good luck thinking a way out while the sword holds the enemy off. [gm may add other appropriate powers and miracles may happen – this item should be managed by close gm-player consultation][e ([[#^[2]]]|Comment #[ 2]])]

|**Eg:  <br>  <br>Centuries ago, the Tlakotani lady Janule wielded a mighty sword in her quest for the Petal Throne. She succeeded in the quest. Later it was made known that the sword was the 'Sword of Avanthe', a blade that had been crafted for the defense of the Goddess herself at the battle of Dormoron Plain. As Avanthe would not normally wield a weapon, the blade required a wielder and bearer. Janule was the first to bear it in millenia.   <br>  <br>The blade disappeared then, for such a sword would be sought by many of the dark gods in order to corrupt it to their own uses. It resurfaces in the later years of the Reign of Emperor HIrkane and is wielded by a powerful lady of the Tlakotani Clan in defense of the Empire against foul machinations by the worm Prince Dhich'une.   <br>  <br>During the Civil War the blade again surfaces, as a champion appears with it, offering to help the scions of the Emperor in their quest for the Petal Throne. Eventually the throne is won by Miruseya, and the champion of the blade is sent to the Western Frontier to oppose the Mu'ugalavyani. General of the 41 ([[#^comment-0\|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) Imperial Archers, the champion is based at R’y.   <br>  <br>This is where the players come in. They are on the retinue of the champion. Although the Sword of Janule (aka Sword of Avanthe) is a powerful item, giving invulnerability for a short time against those things that Avanthe opposes, it is limited in its uses. The sword may have other powers, but the imperfections of any human disallow the ability to use them at will. Even the champion, a fanatic Aridani, needs help. Thus enemies can overcome the champion by using traitors and beasts that the sword cannot affect.   <br>This is the setting of the campaign as the players strive against Pe Choi ambushes, Mu'ugalavyani war parties, Ito Clan evil and many dangers in the Jungles of the Chakas (as well as traitors among their own people).   <br>More as the situation develops...   <br>-your scribe,   <br>Hlucha**|

**Secrets of Tekumel**

**Tlakotani.**

Spell of Opening...Tlakotani only

_This spell exists from pre-Tekumel Tlakotani. It was used to open the "life" of a city or legion so that the powers that be blessed the spirit so engendered. As the thickness of reality was incredibly thick in pre-Tekumel times, the effect was muted unless huge sacrifices of valuables or souls were made. (Valuables create longing in living sentients, so various were used to substitute for souls). By this method auras of "luck" or holiness were created. In the present world-Bethorm the spell is indeed powerful, and creates (random) holy objects. If one adds other spells/items for guidance the creation can be modified_

Professor Barker and I talked about the Tlakotani shortly before he died. We should have known from the books, game and hints, but he confirmed that the Tlakotani who "have existed since the dawn of time" are more than a clan. 

In short the Tlakotani are the descendants of people directly related to the gods. Their true lineage allows some of them to enact rituals that bring legions and cities to life, gain the support of powers beyond mortal Ken and keep the flame of existence burning. The God-Emperor of Tsolyanu is made of no empty promise and is not merely a title! At points in history the Tlakotani appear, set the world to rights, and again fade into the background to await the gods' call. 

Thus when the God-Emperor enters the Golden Tower he takes on an God-aspect fully. Witness the consternation of Harsan in Man of Gold when he sees Prince Dhich'une do this as part of a ritual. The seclusion is for the emperor and the people alike, as seeing this happen would lead to distrust, fear and other repercussions! 

In my introduction to the world of Tekumel d20 I would like to confine the description and reveals to tech/magic views. Only the highest of the Tlakotani will know this of course, because it's a secret that protects Tsolyani life! 

-------------Clan Elder to new Elder--------------

I begin for you dear clan cousin, with our heritage. Not all of our clan are or should be aware of the full particulars, and thus your secrecy is sworn. 

Thought you that the armies alone protect our Empire? Nay, or else Engsvan would yet endure. Our Emperor sits atop a petal throne, guarded by those who pass through the Jade Arch. The Seal itself is an essential item of our power. Yet without the lineage of the Tlakotani in his veins none of this would avail the Emperor. Only the true blood of the gods can enact the gods will. Against this and the other scions of our clan are arrayed inimical powers, demons and evil mortals. 

Yes my cousin the Tlakotani can easily arm you with weapons, create with marvellous items and face off the most monstrous hazards as though at a tea drinking ceremony. It is not weakness that allows us to affect our noble mien,  indifference to toil, careless seeming manners. Though the other high clans ape our indifference they cannot back up their power as can the Tlakotani. 

You enter our world now, where you can take part in endless entertainments afforded by techno -magic, the visitations of books, exotic foods and drinks. This world is meaningless and droll to us, though others crave it, for the true life is within you, a spark of the divine that makes all else but mud. Through a world of tests you have passed and been chosen. There is no returning to the old life, a fate that all chosen face, only forward or sacrifice. Witness the mischief that the false emperor created and know the wisdom of this, a servant of the gods gone wrong is disaster for all existence! 

You will learn the items, ways and preparations. Allies will be given you, then the expectation of the Throne. Yes, dear cousin your employment in the Clan's highest art form will be long and glorious!

➡️Items (from Tekumel.com and may require permissions):

The arena model. A small arena model, touch it and you appear in it. Don't touch the fighting area.

Books of history with moving pictures. Touch the picture to enter the reality of a pocket dimension wherein the history enacts for a few hours. Be polite or die in some extreme instances.

Subminiature interfogulators and pridulators for personal use and protection! Use against extreme threats only (see books above) 

Interesting gadgets like the one in the story of the old Dra priestess! (Mitlanyal)

➡️Other items and original ideas by the professor (some in text of chapter 5):

The services of Gij and sons (see Sarvodaya Di'ela and her things including servants in book 5 A Death of Kings)

The touch stones (Lords of Tsamra had a set to the spaceship) that connect to other places. 

The rings of the First Founder (I have a chart of their powers, they weren't all alike (communication between Phil and myself) are true relics of the Tlakotani, most powerful in the hands of that lineage as are actual weapons of the Gods themselves. (Example, the Sword of Janule in the hands of any Avanthe/Dlamelish worshipper allows an impenetrable shield once a week while praying. In the hands of a Tlakotani Avanthe/Dlamelish this is the minimum power, with added blue glow that may change reality as an aspect suffuses the wielder!)

See above examples for such charts.
