**Empire of the Petal Throne for 3 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) edition D&D** by Sammy Grimes ([Grimess@uark.edu](mailto:Grimess@mail.uark.edu))

**Conversion From:** Empire of the Petal Throne (based on the ‘White Box’ D&D game), 1976

**Works Converted:** Empire of the Petal Throne by M.A.R. Barker, Tirkélu by Dave Morris, various other

Tekumél conversions (for GURPS, The Fantasy Trip, Runequest, and AD&D 2 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) ed).

**Summary:** This updates EPT for use with the D&D 3.5 rules giving notes on races and classes.

**Updates:** September 25, 2000; created this file. October 10, 2000; was contacted by M.A.R. Barker and

he has asked me to modify the copyright notice (praise the Lord for Prof. Barker’s Mercy). And

found a way to avoid those damnable temple spell lists by using domains. June 11, 2001; totally

reworked the cleric, fleshed out some of the races, reworked the administrative priest, and some

other rule changes. June 26, 2001. Just some fine-tuning; October 12, 2001: Added temple lists

for psions. June 3, 2005 based the races on the Tri-stat version, reworked the class system.

**Note:** My primary source for this game is Empire of the Petal Throne, though I do use information from

Gardásiyal I don’t particularly care for realistic fantasy games. Though some have written that

D&D is inappropriate to the ‘feel’ of Tekumél, I believe they really mean it is inappropriate to the

feel of Swords & Glory or Gardásiyal not Tekumél. EPT had very heroic characters who could

take on small armies by themselves and separate spell casting classes, and that is why I wrote this

conversion.

**Copyright notice:** These materials utilise Professor M. A. R. Barker's creation of the World of Tekumel

but are not be considered 'authentic Tekumel' and are in no way 'approved' by Professor Barker.

This work is made using the d20 system.

For those of you who do not know Empire of the Petal Throne was created by M.A.R. Barker from a world he had created as a boy. It was the second roleplaying game ever and also was the second game published by TSR, Inc. The system used a variant of the original ‘White Box’ D&D game. If you think Dark Sun is exotic, then you will be surprised at the depth and breath of this world. M.A.R. Barker has created a world totally unlike our own. The races are unlike anything that has appeared anywhere else and there are several languages created for the game.

## Character Races

ALIENS IN TSOLYÁNU

Non-humans in Tsolyánu are generally second-class citizens, if they are citizens at all. Many can find employment, but will never be accepted into a Clan and thus will never be more than respected foreigners. Some few, especially the Pachi Lei and Pe Choi, can be fully accepted into Tsolyáni society if they adopt human language and customs—and they may even attain Clan membership for themselves and their descendants if they serve the Empire well.

All alien races (except the Pé Chói and Páchi Léi) have outsider status in Tsolyánu thus they have a –3 to NPC reactions.

Proper Names are given for races that have pronounceable names (except the Ahoggyá who are given distinctive nicknames).

**Note on racial modifiers:** despite a character's racial modifiers no ability score can go below "1" in value. A character whose intelligence is reduced below "3" will still get a minimum of 4 initial skill points and 1 skill point per level.

## Ahoggyá

Ahoggya are radially symmetric creatures around 1.5 meters tall, with four legs, four arms, and a barrel-shaped body about .8 m in diameter topped by a thick, domed carapace. They are brown, blue, green, grey, or dun in color (or a mixture of those). Their extremely strong arms extend out of their body at equidistant intervals, and have hands with three digits and a thumb. Between each pair of arms is a “face” protected by a horn-like ring. Each face includes two eyes; one face also has a fanged mouth, while the others have other sensory or reproductive organs. The Ahoggyá’s legs are bowed and very powerful. Their excretory organs are centered up beneath their body. Ahoggyá can use weapons made for humans, though somewhat awkwardly.

Some Ahoggyá emerge from their swampy homelands to serve as mercenaries in the Tsolyáni legions, fight in the arenas, or take other jobs, usually involving strength and violence. They generally stay in Tsolyánu for only a few years, though some stay longer, and have little interest in complying with human customs or values. Ahoggyá have eight sexes, so the difficulty of getting a suitable group of mates together may be part of the motivation to return to the Ahoggyá homeland as often as practical.

- Names: Ahoggyá names are incomprehensible and unspeakable to humans (the Tsolyanu say that their names sound like sewage going down a drain), so humans tag them with nicknames, and the Ahoggyá do not seem to care. Here are some examples of Ahoggyá nicknames: Barrel of Swords, Big Bag, Black-Spotted One, Dirty One, Gnarled One, Loudest Belly, Old Mud-Pie, Old White-Side, Red-Eye, Scar-Gut, Yellow Splotched One.
- +4 Strength, +4 Constitution, -4 Dexterity, -2 Intelligence, +4 Wisdom, -8 Charisma
- Low Pedhtel: Ahoggya have a -4 penalty to any spellcasting attribute to determine bonus spells, save DCs to spells, and maximum spell level castable and their wisdom bonus does not apply to spellcasting.
- Large-Sized. Ahoygga take a -1 size penalty to Armor Class, a -1 size penalty on attack rolls, and a -4 size penalty on Hide checks. They gain a +4 size bonus on grapple checks. Their lifting and carrying limits are twice those of a Medium-sized character. Ahoggya may use large-sized weapons one handed, huge-sized weapons two handed, and light weapons for them are medium-sized or smaller. An Ahoggya fills a 5' x 5' fighting space and has a natural reach of 10 feet.
- An Ahoygga's base speed is 30 feet.
- Natural Armor: The Ahoggya's central barrel is heavily armored, but their limbs are not, so they have a +4 natural armor bonus.
- Extra Arms: The Ahoggya has four arms, it may make +3 extra attack actions with normal off-hand penalties, but cannot attack an opponent with more than two of its limbs (since they are evenly spaced around its central barrel).
- Stability: An Ahoggya's four legs grant it a +4 stability bonus on checks made to resist bull bush and trip attempts.
- Expanded Field of Vision: Ahoggyá have a 360-degree sphere of sight, allowing them a perfect view of creatures that might otherwise flank them. Thus, flanking opponents gain no bonus on their attack rolls, and anyone is denied their sneak attack ability because they do not lose their Dexterity bonus (but they may still sneak attack them if they are caught flat-footed). Their Spot and Search checks gain a +4 enhancement bonus. Concurrently, they take a –4 penalty on saves against all gaze attacks.
- -2 to all Charisma-based checks when dealing with Shen.
- ECL: +2, Ahoggya are treated as being two levels higher than normal for determining experience needed to advance.

## Hláka

Hláka are slender and light-boned, with six limbs: two legs, two arms, and two leathery wings. Their head is humanoid but somewhat flattened, with three close-set eyes, often bright blue, protected by nictating membranes beneath a heavy brow ridge, set in a bony crest. A furred ruff conceals their hearing organs. They can fly quite well, but dislike walking any distance because their legs are relatively weak, as are their arms. They are covered in greyish or brownish short fur. They have a powerful prehensile tail, tipped with a rapier-like bony blade that they often poison before combat. Hláka are around 1.5 m tall, though they are quite light for their size.

- Names: The following are examples of Hláka names: Chráò Eyúo Máíi, Dzá, Ewò-i-iyá, Iwáu Aé'eyá, Méya-Aì, Míyo-éya Hiómai, Náàiya-éya, Nà-éya Tió, Ssaeó, Súa-eyá. To the Tsolyanu they sound as if they are all vowels.
- Strength -2, Constitution -2, Dexterity +4, Wisdom -4
- Base Speed (land) 20 feet per round
- Hlaka have a +4 racial bonus to all spot checks. Hlaka only suffer a -1 penalty to spot checks every 25 feet of distance instead of every 10 feet for other characters.
- Expanded Field of Vision: Hláka have a 270-degree sphere of sight, allowing them an almost perfect view of creatures that might otherwise flank them. Thus, flanking opponents gain only a +1 bonus on their attack rolls, and anyone is denied their sneak attack ability because they do not lose their Dexterity bonus (but they may still sneak attack them if they are caught flat-footed). Their Spot and Search checks gain a +2 enhancement bonus. Concurrently, they take a –2 penalty on saves against all gaze attacks.
- Flight. Hlaka have a flight speed of 40 ft (good). A Hlaka's fly speed is 40 ft (average) in light armor and drops to 30 ft (poor) in medium armor. A Hlaka cannot fly when wearing heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load. As long as a Hlaka is conscious and able to use its wings, it never takes damage from a fall. Instead, it simply takes flight or glides safely to the ground. If the Hlaka cannot use its wings, it takes falling damage as normal.
- Extra limb. The Hlaka have a prehensile tail which can handle a weapon at normal two-weapon penalties. It has a spike that can do 1d4 damage when not wielding a weapon.

# Human

Humans are the vast majority. The five great empires Livyánu, Mu’ugalavyá, Tsolyánu, Yán Kór, and Salarv’yá are ruled by humans and most of the smaller nations are formed and ruled by humans. Except for the N'lüss they conform to the standard rules for creating humans in the Player’s Handbook.

**Names:** All Tsolyánu have a personal name, a lineage name, and a clan name. The personal name comes first then the prefix hi- (vu- if the character is from Vra province, followed by the father’s lineage name or dhu- [followed by the mother’s lineage name] if the character is from north of Purdimál, and no prefix if the character is from the Chakas [with father’s lineage name], also middle names are common in Purdimál and the northwest) and lineage name and then Clan name. So a sample name is Lazháto hiSsánmiren of the Sea Blue Clan.

- Powerful Build: The physical stature of N’lüsss lets them function in many ways as if they were one size category larger. Whenever a N’lüss is subject to a size modifier or special size modifier for an opposed check (such as during grapple checks, bull rush attempts, and trip attempts), the N’lüss is treated as one size larger if doing so is advantageous to him. A N’lüss is also considered to be one size larger when determining whether a creature’s special attacks based on size (such as improved grab or swallow whole) can affect him. A N’lüss can use weapons designed for a creature one size larger without penalty. However, his space and reach remain those of a creature of his actual size. The benefits of this racial trait stack with the effects of powers, abilities, and spells that change the subject’s size category.

- N’lüss base land speed is 40 feet.

A Swamp Folk who merely passes within 5 feet of a secret or concealed door is entitled to a Search check to notice it as if it were actively looking for the door. Swamp Folk also have the ability to detect dimension nexus points

## Tinalíya

Tinalíya are small: adults usually stand about two feet in height. They follow the pattern of so many other interstellar species: four short, outward-bowed legs; a spherical abdomen, upon which the torso is centrally placed; two long arms ending in claw-like, three-fingered hands with an opposable thumb; and a back-sloping head with huge eyes; and vaguely humanoid features. The body is divided into small, bulbous segments and is covered all over with a brownish, russet, or tan horny integument. Their limbs thus resemble strings of brown beads. Tinalíya have three sexes: males (10%), females (5%), and neuters (85%).

- Names: The first name denotes the gender of the Tinalíya (Chí is female, Tí is neuter, and Tâ is male). The second a descriptor (Ákh, Ané, Chní, Ekká, Kát, K'kés, Mnéch, Né, Nmé, Pá', Pè'l, Sô, Sà), and the last a place name in Tinalíya (Ulé, Tûvé, Qó, Ün, Ésra iú, Hè, Ó, K'kåch, Lü, Táng, Qó).
- -4 Strength, +2 Dexterity, -2 Constitution, +2 Intelligence, +2 Wisdom
- Very High Pedhtel: +4 bonus to any spellcasting attribute to determine maximum spell level castable, bonus spells, and spell DCs.
- A Tinalíya's base speed is 30 feet.
- Small-sized: Tinalíya gain a +1 size bonus to Defense, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +4 size bonus on Hide checks. They take a -4 penalty on grapple checks. Their lifiting and carrying capacity limits are three-quarters those of a Medium-sized character. Tinalíya must use two hands to wield a Medium-sized weapon, and light weapons for them are Tiny or smaller.
- Literal-Minded: Tinalíya cannot have ranks in Bluff or Sense Motive and take a -4 penalty to untrained use of those checks because they cannot comprehend humor, metaphors, or figurative speech.
- Stability: A Tinalíya's four legs grant it a +4 stability bonus on checks made to resist bull bush and trip attempts.

## Urunén

The Urunén have only recently been contacted via the underground tubeway car system. They have had no other contact with humankind since the Latter Times, although they knew of humankind through artifacts and inscriptions. Urunén are a little taller than the human norm (five and half to just over six feet); they are humanoid, bipedal, erect, and have two man-like arms ending in four-digited hands with an opposable thumb. There the resemblance ends. This species is covered with short, brownish fur, almost like a nap of velvet. They have a long tail, which is not prehensile, and their heads are long-snouted, triangular in shape (somewhat resembling a moose), with the brain-case at the back, two big eyes set wide apart on each side of the head, and a moist, mobile nose.

- Names: Aiché, Arévi, Hú
- Intelligence +2, Constitution -2
- High Pedhtel: Urunen gain a +2 bonus to all spellcasting attributes for determining bonus spells, spell DC modifiers, and maximum spell level castable.
- Expanded Field of Vision: Urunén have a 270-degree sphere of sight, allowing them an almost perfect view of creatures that might otherwise flank them. Thus, flanking opponents gain only a +1 bonus on their attack rolls, and anyone is denied their sneak attack ability because they do not lose their Dexterity bonus (but they may still sneak attack them if they are caught flat-footed). Their Spot and Search checks gain a +2 enhancement bonus. Concurrently, they take a –2 penalty on saves against all gaze attacks.Medium-sized
- +2 racial bonus to diplomacy and bluff checks
- Have Endure Elements (Cold only) constantly as an exceptional ability. This means they can survive temperatures down to -50 degrees F without ill effects.

## Character Classes

The standard character classes do not exist on Tekumel, instead the Generic Class system from Unearthed Arcana (pg 76-78) exist along with the Psion from from the Expanded Psionics Handbook (pg 19-21) with some modifications.

The following character classes exist: Expert, Psion, Sorceror, and Warrior.

# Class Features

All the following are class features of the psion.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency:** Psions are proficient with the club, dagger, heavy crossbow, light crossbow, quarterstaff, and shortspear. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield.

**Power Points/Day:** A psion’s ability to manifest powers is limited by the power points he has available. His base daily allotment of power points is given on Table: The Psion. In addition, he receives bonus power points per day if he has a high Intelligence score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Power Points). His race may also provide bonus power points per day, as may certain feats and items.

**Temple:** Every psion must decide at 1st level which god he will serve which will restrict his power list to the general power list and the spells of his temple. Choosing a god provides a psion with access to the powers restricted to the temple of that god. However, choosing a temple also means that the psion cannot learn powers that are restricted to other temples. He can’t even use such powers by employing psionic items.

**Powers Known:** A psion begins play knowing three psion powers of your choice. Each time he achieves a new level, he unlocks the knowledge of new powers.

Choose the powers known from the psion power list, or from the list of powers of your chosen temple. You cannot choose powers from temples other than your chosen temple. A psion can manifest any power that has a power point cost equal to or lower than his manifester level.

The number of times a psion can manifest powers in a day is limited only by his daily power points.

A psion simply knows his powers; they are ingrained in his mind. He does not need to prepare them (in the way that some spellcasters prepare their spells), though he must get a good night’s sleep each day to regain all his spent power points.

The Difficulty Class for saving throws against psion powers is 10 + the power’s level + the psion’s Intelligence modifier.

**Maximum Power Level Known:** A psion begins play with the ability to learn 1st-level powers. As he attains higher levels, a psion may gain the ability to master more complex powers.

To learn or manifest a power, a psion must have an Intelligence score of at least 10 + the power’s level.

**Bonus Feats:** A psion gains a bonus feat at 1st level, 5th level, 10th level, 15th level, and 20th level. This feat must be a psionic feat, a metapsionic feat, or a psionic item creation feat.

These bonus feats are in addition to the feats that a character of any class gains every three levels. A psion is not limited to psionic feats, metapsionic feats, and psionic item creation feats when choosing these other feats.

SORCERER

The sorceror covers all those who use otherworldly powers through ritual and formulae rather than merely by exercise of will. The lose the casting flexibility of the psion for a greater variety of effects.

**Hit Die:** d4.

### Class Skills

The spellcaster may choose any eight skills as class skills.

**Skill Points at 1st Level:** (2 + Int modifier) x 4.

**Skill Points at Each Additional Level:** 2 + Int modifier.

### Class Features

All of the following are class features of the sorcerer.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency:** Sorcerers are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor of any type interferes with a sorcerer’s gestures, which can cause his spells with somatic components to fail.

**Spells:** At 1st level the sorceror must choose whether he is a arcane or divine spellcaster and to which temple he belongs (a divine sorceror does not have to pick a temple, instead he is a shaman and casts spells from the shaman list instead). A sorceror who casts divine spells draws primarily from the cleric spell list and his temple list. A sorcerer who casts arcane spells draws primarily from the sorcerer/wizard spell list and his temple list. He cannot choose both.

To learn or cast a divine spell, a sorcerer must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a sorcerer’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the sorcerer’s Wisdom modifier.

To learn or cast an arcane spell, a sorcerer must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a sorcerer’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the sorcerer’s Intelligence modifier.

Like other spellcasters, a sorcerer can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Sorcerer. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom (if a divine caster) or Intelligence (if an arcane caster) score.

A sorcerer begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of your choice plus _read magic_ at one time. At each new sorcerer level, he gains the ability to know one or more new spells, as indicated on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a sorcerer knows is not affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known are fixed.)

A sorcerer can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the sorcerer “loses” the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell’s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. Divine sorcerors do so by meditating and praying for 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation or supplication.

An arcane sorceror must study her spellbook for 1 hour each day to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. She cannot learn any spell not recorded in her spellbook, except for _read magic_, which all arcane sorcerors can prepare from memory.

An arcane sorceror begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard spells (except those from other temples) plus three 1st-level spells of your choice. For each point of Intelligence bonus the arcane sorceror has, the spellbook holds one additional 1st-level spell of your choice. At each new arcane sorceror level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new arcane sorceror's level) for her spellbook. At any time, an arcane sorceror can also add spells found in other arcane sorcerors’ spellbooks to her own.

He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his spells per day for that spell level. He does not have to decide ahead of time which spells he’ll cast.

**Bonus Feats:** At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level, a sorceror gains a bonus feat. At each such opportunity, she can choose a metamagic feat or an item creation feat. The sorceror must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including caster level minimums.

These bonus feats are in addition to the feat that a character of any class gets from advancing levels. The sorceror is not limited to the categories of item creation feats or metamagic feats when choosing these feats.

**Note on material components:** The standard material component rules should be replaced. Every Sorceror has a “Sorcerer’s chest” which costs 10 káitars per level. This will contain all the character’s needed material components for a casters who cast spells on a regular basis for a month, unless the components are very expensive (more than a siginficant fraction of the costs above).

WARRIOR

The warrior covers all the members of the Everglorious legions of the Petal Throne (and the lesser legions of the other empires) to the lesser professional gladiators of the Hiriklate Arenas to simple legbreakers and thugs.

**Hit Die:** d10.

### Class Skills

The warrior may choose any six skills as class skills.

**Skill Points at 1st Level:** (2 + Int modifier) x4.

**Skill Points at Each Additional Level:** 2 + Int modifier.

### Class Features

All of the following are class features of the warrior.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency:** A warrior is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, medium, and light) and shields (including tower shields).

**Saves:** The character chooses one of his three saves to be a good save and the other two are poor saves. Once the decision is made it cannot be changed later.

**Bonus Feats:** At 1st level, a warrior gets a bonus combat-oriented feat in addition to the feat that any 1st-level character gets and the bonus feat granted to a human character. The warrior gains an additional bonus feat at 2nd level and every two warrior levels thereafter (4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, and 20th). These bonus feats must be drawn from the feats noted as warrior bonus feats (fighter feats in the Player's Handbook). A warrior must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including ability score and base attack bonus minimums.

These bonus feats are in addition to the feat that a character of any class gets from advancing levels. A warrior is not limited to the list of warrior bonus feats when choosing these feats.

# Skills

The Ride skill does not exist. There are no suitable riding creatures to be found on the known continent.

**Note:** though not common, the technical skills of computer use, pilot, and repair do exist. Nobody will have them as class skills because of their rarity (unless it is among certain nonhuman races). Read/Write Language is a separate skill from Speak Language. All high clan or lower Tsolyanu have illiteracy as a barbarian (see PH pg. 25) except for arcane sorcerors. Everyone must buy Read/Write and Speak separately. Most languages may be bought as class skills except Ái Ché, Duruób, Llyáni, Mihálli, Thu'úsa, the Tongue of the Lord of Worms, and the written form of Ghatóni, which must be bought as cross-class skills (or with 2 initial languages) and the Tongue of the Priests of Ksárul and Súnuz, which are also bought as cross-class languages (or with 2 initial languages), but require the Unusual Language feat.

All characters will speak their native language with a rating of 3 + level (plus intelligence bonus) with a +3 skill focus bonus and a +2 expert bonus (any accent will be the accent of their region). Their skill total is treated as total ranks. Bonus languages from intelligence are initially treated as having 0 ranks, but the character's skill bonus rather than his skill ranks determines proficiency much like a native language (however, its rank does not automatically go up in level like the native language). These represent languages in which he had schooling in at a young age.

Modern languages: Aomórh, Ghatóni, Hijajái, Jannuyáni, Livyáni, Lo'orúnankh, Milumanayáni, Mu'ugalavyáni, N'lüssa, Pe'é, Pecháni, Sa'á Allaqiyáni, Salarvyáni, Tká Mihálli, Tsoléi'i, Tsolyáni, Yán Koryáni.

Ancient languages: Ái Ché, Ancient Mihálli, Bednálljan Salarvyáni, Classic Mu'ugalavyáni, Classic Tsolyáni, Duruób, Engsvanyáli, Llyani, Súnuz, Thu'úsa, The Tongue of the Lord of Worms, The Tongue of the Priests of Ksárul, Tsáqw (Classical Yán Koryáni), Zna'yé.

**Language Levels** (Optional Rule): In Tekumél is not as important which languages you know as it is how well you speak that language. The cost for each level is shown below. The character cannot spend more points on a language than he can on any other type of skill.

**Skill Level Notes**

**Ranks**

1-4 Pidgin Can speak haltingly, can barely understand or be understood.

5-8 Normal Can speak with an thick accent.

9-12 Proficient Can speak with slight (but noticeable) accent.

13-16 Flawless Can speak with no accent. A character with outsider status suffers only

a –2 on all reaction penalties.

20+ Scholar Can adopt any accent or specialized jargon easily. The character gets a

+2 synergy bonus to disguise checks in a culture that speaks this

language.

The character can buy Read/Write Language with levels, being better at speaking a language than writing it (or vice-versa), and levels are equivalent. Ahoygga may learn to speak human Languages up to normal proficiency (with their usual ghastly accent), but no higher. Hlaka have parrot-like vocal apparati and can learn to speak any language as easily as a human can. Other races may buy speak human languages as cross-class skills (or +1 per rank of harder languages, so Sunuz would cost 4 points per rank for a Pe Choi), their alien vocal cords cannot make all the same sounds as a human. Humans may learn any Shén language, Páchi Léi, one of the three Pé Chói languages, Swamp Folk, one of the three Tinalíya languages, or Urunén as a cross-class skill.

**Computer Use** (Int)

##### This skill cannot be used untrained

When Empire of the Petal Throne came out the computer wasn’t as widespread as it is today. When the future comes it is likely that they will become more and more widespread, to the point where we won’t recognize computers. By the time of the Ancient’s star empire, computers have reached sentience (the Ru’un is an example). Of course, after the cataclysm when survival was paramount, computer literacy dropped dramatically. Probably by the time of the Empire of Llyán, computer use was an guarded secret of the few. Computers may be

found in ancient ruins and in a few temples (as a closely guarded secret) and probably as well guarded state secrets. This will also allow the character to reprogram ancient robots such as the Ru’un. More than likely only priests of Thúmis and Ksárul will even know of the existence of

computers, but training is possible as the character rises in circle.

**DC Task**

20 Modify existing programs

25 to 35 Create New programs

30 Break Into Secure Systems

+5 Complex Systems

**Demolitions** (Int)

##### This skill cannot be used untrained

It is unlikely the character will find ancient explosives, let alone know how to use them, but this skill is included for completeness.

**Knowledge** (etiquette) (Int)

Etiquette in the five empires is perhaps the most important skill, it covers the proper form of dress for an occasion, the right way to say “you” to a person, recognizing clan, religion, and legion signs, etc.

**Perform** (Cha)

Every ritual spell caster has this skill as a class skill. Song, dance, chants, etc. are vital components in spell casting on this world.

**Pilot** (Int)

##### This skill cannot be used untrained

The most common (though still exceedingly rare) ancient vehicles left are the aircars. As a rule of thumb DCs for piloting are 10 for low-speed turns and rolls, 15 for half-loops or long rolls, 20 for tight turns or loop and turn, 25 for bootlegger turns or hand banks, and 30 or more for high speed jumps or slides past an obstacle.

**Repair** (Int)

##### This skill cannot be used untrained

The most likely object that needs to repaired are the eyes. Simple repairs have a base DC 15 to 20 and complex repairs of DC 25 or more. The character needs the proper tools or the DC is increased by +5. Tools are themselves rare and would probably be found in the possession of a priesthood or the Tinalíya.

**Treat Injury** (Wis)

_This skill cannot be used untrained_

This skill indicates the character’s knowledge of the medical techniques of the ancients. The character can never have a skill higher in this skill than his heal skill. It enables the character to use ancient artifacts to speed healing. The character will get more use out of healing devices (such as the Ineluctable Eye of Healing)

than an untrained character.

# Money and Equipment

Money: Money in Tsolyánu is based on the Káitar, a gold coin weighing approximately 3 grams and roughly equal in value to the standard D&D gold piece. The coin system is base 20 (instead of base 10) so there are 20 silver Hlásh and

400 copper Qirgál in a Káitar (there are no platinum coins). Just substitute Hlásh for silver pieces and Qirgál for copper pieces. Items made of Iron cost more (see below)

**Káitar Hlásh Qirgál**

**Káitar** 1 20 400

**Hlásh** 1/20 1 20

**Qirgál** 1/400 1/20 1

**Chlén-hide**: Weapons and armor made of Chlén-hide are specially treated to make them almost as hard as bronze and can be a substitute for metal. Chlén-hide weapons are –1 to hit and –1 to damage and if the character makes a maximum damage roll has a 1 in 20 chance of breaking his weapon. Chlén-hide armor has –2 armor protection, but has –5% spell failure, maximum Dexterity bonus is increased by 1, +5 foot to movement, and armor check penalties are increased by +2. Chlén-hide cannot be enchanted and cannot be made masterwork. Cost is normal and weight is one-third normal.

**Bronze:** Weapons made of bronze (or copper) cost x10 more than normal, armor costs x15 as much. Masterwork components for these items remain the same cost. Bronze weapons are –1 to hit (only) and bronze armor is –1 AC (only).

**Steel:** Weapons made of steel cost x500 more than normal cost, armor costs x300 as much. If the item is to be made masterwork then to complete the masterwork component x350 times the base cost of the item if it is a weapon and x100 base cost if it is armor (this replaces the flat costs for masterwork components on page 66 of the Player's Handbook). So a steel chainmail suit costs 45,000 káitars, and a masterwork suit of chainmail costs an additional 45,000 káitars (triple the cost of the masterwork component) for a total of 90,000 káitars. A steel longsword costs 7,500 káitars, and if it is made masterwork it will cost an additional 15,750 káitars for a total for 23,250 káitars. Multiply the cost of all steel magic items by x10 from base price in the DMG. Flint, Steel, and Tinder costs 20 káitars.

**Slaves:** These are the costs for slaves.

# Slave Type Cost

Servant boy or girl 150

Untrained Labor 200

Semiskilled Labor 2,000

Skilled Labor 5,000

Academically trained 10,000

Overseer 8,000

Man-at-arms (1 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) level) 5,000

Spellcaster (1-2 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) level) 10,000

Dancing Girl, Courtesan 20,000

Nonhuman (PC races only) +15,000

**Magic and Metal**

Contact with metal grounds the use of both psychic and ritual magic (though this has no effect once the spell is cast). If the caster carries one psé (750 grams, a pound is 454 grams) of metal there is a base 1% chance of failure (in addition to normal Arcane Failure checks), doubled each time for each additional psé (2% for 2 Psé, 4% for 3, 8% for 4, 16% for 5, 32% for 6, 64% for 7, and 99% for 8 Psé or more). Lesser amounts do not cause spell failure (so the character can safely carry a steel dagger). However, copper and bronze have a reduced effect of 1% per 3 Psé, doubled for each additional 3 Psé (up to 99% for 24 Psé of bronze or copper). If the spell or power fails because of metal, roll on the table below for effects:

**Metal Spell Failure Table**

**Roll Effect**

1-5 The spell/power simply fails and the character retains his spell slot

or power points

6-10 The spell/power simply fails and the character loses his spell slot

or power points

11-15 The caster must make a will save as if he had cast the spell or take

1d6 damage per spell/power level (0-level spells do 1-3 point of

damage). A successful save means the character takes no damage,

but he has lost all his spell slots or power points for the day.

16-20 Everyone within 10 feet of the caster must make a will save or take

1d6 damage per spell/power level (0-level spells do 1-3 points of

damage). A successful save means that person avoided damage.

Because of this spellcasters avoid carrying metal arms and armor and tend to avoid even carrying

coins, making use of gems or letters of credit instead.

# Magic Levels

# The level of magic in Tekumél varies in some areas. Areas rich in magic will allow a spell

# caster to add half the spell level of the spell in metamagic feats chosen at the time of casting (with no increase in spell casting time, round up) to his spells. Psionic powers have reduced power costs:

# Power Level 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

Power point cost 0 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15

First-level powers may be manifested 3 + level times per day freely without spend Power Points. Second and higher level powers are manifested using the costs above. All feats that require psychic focus to be expended now only require that psychic focus be maintained, and those that require a psychic focus to be maintained do not require a psychic focus. These include the cities of Hmakuyál (Only affects the spells of the priests of Ksárul and Grugánu), Púrdimal, Avanthár, and Sárku (Only affects the spells of the priests of Sárku and Durritlamish) in Tsolyánu; Ch’óchi

in Mu’ugalavyá; Jgrésh in Salarvyá; and most of

the east coast of Livyánu.

Areas poor in magic will cause the caster to cast his spells with increased casting time (free action spells are cast as one full round, one action spells are cast with a time of 5 full rounds, spells with one round casting times take five minutes to cast, a spell with longer than one round casting time takes x 10 normal time), though Quicken spell will reduce the casting time (minimum of one round). Psionic powers takes the normal amount of time to manifest, but cost extra to manifest:

# Power Level 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

Power point cost 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 19 21

Feats that require a psychic focus to be maintained now require psychic focus to be expended and feats that require a psychic focus to be expended cannot be used. One such place is the long swathe of terrain from Chayákku to Nuru’ún.

And in areas with no magic, spells cannot be cast. Among these are the Plain of Towers, the Dry Bay of Ssu’úm, and the Tsoléi archipelago. A character may attempt to cast a spell or manifest a power, but must make a spellcraft or psicraft (vs. DC 15 + spell/power level) to cast/manifest. If the character fails he loses the power points or spell slot.

# Spell Alterations

# _Animate Dead_

Produces one Mrúr or Tsóggu (they are undead despite the description in the bestiary) per two caster levels. See Zombie under the spell heading for more details.

##### Create Undead

An 11 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) level or higher caster may create Shédra, and A 16 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) level or higher caster may create Hru'ú.

##### Create Greater Undead

A 15 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) level or higher caster may create Vorodlá, and a 18 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) level or higher caster may create Hrá.

# New and Modified Feats

**Defects:** Defects are a type of feat that gives the character back a normal feat. The character cannot have defects and feats that contradict each other.

# Addiction [Defect]

The character has an addiction.

**Hindrance:** The character must make a willpower check vs. DC 15 every five minutes in the presence of his addiction to avoid indulgence. Also the character must acquire an appropiate knowledge skill with maximum skill ranks at each level dealing with his addiction.

**Allure [General]**

The character is more attractive than normal

**Requirements:** CH 15+

**Benefit:** The character has a +3 to NPC reactions with interacting with members of the opposite sex who are at least young adult in age. The character may also have a cohort of the opposite sex and at least young adult in age who tags along out of romantic interest (cf. Leadership feat).

**Note:** The character may only buy this feat at 1st level

# Two-Weapon Fighting, Improved Two-weapon Fighting [All General]

These feats are rare in Tsolyánu (where it is known as Hlèpurdál), but is somewhat less rare in the Hirilákte arenas. These feats originate from Salarvyá and together the fighting style is known as Arruché. It is considered somewhat disreputable outside of Salarvyá due to its foreign origin (again except in the Hirilákte arenas, where a good Hlèpurdál duelist is much admired).

# Bad Reputation [Defect]

The character starts the game with –5 respect and can lose up to 15 points of respect due to the effects of time (going over the normal limit).

**Skill Points:** The character gains +6 skill points for taking this defect.

# Behavioral Characteristic [Defect]

The character has some obvious personality trait the others feel is odd, such as unswerving loyalty to one person, minor phobia, an oath of silence, etc.

# Clumsy [Defect]

The character must make reflex checks (vs. DC 15) in order to perform normal actions (outside combat) and is always involved in minor accidents.

# Combat Restriction [Defect]

The character has a –2 attack bonus penalty and a –2 AC penalty.

# Contact [General]

The character starts with a well-placed, useful contact, determined by the GM, who can offer occasional help or information.

# Distractable [Defect]

The character must make a willpower (DC 15) check to perform dull repetitive tasks or to remember small things (like making a pot of chutmél) and has a +5 DC penalty to any cooperative skill check. He cannot take 20 on any skill check, and taking 10 requires that he take the same amount of time a 20 normally takes.

# Emotion Control [General]

The character is in control of his own emotions and can manage those of others.

**Benefit:** The character gets +2 to his diplomacy and intimidation checks.

# Exotic Weapon [General]

The quarterstaff is considered an exotic weapon. In Saá Allaqí quaterstaff fighting is known as Kichána and is rarely practiced outside of that nation.

# Fragile [Defect]

The character does not start with maximum hit points, takes a -1 penalty per level to his hit die rolls, and has a –4 penalty to any endurance related rolls.

**Harmony Amongst the Five Selves [General]**

The character is assumed to be taking 0 when asleep and only needs 4 hours of sleep a night (he can still only regain spells or power points once per day), but must spend the other 4 hours in quiet contemplation or study.

**Normal:** Characters are assumed to be taking

-10 when asleep and need 8 hours of sleep a

night.

**Special:** This is incompatible with the Shadow Scars defect.

# Good with Animals [General]

The character gets a +2 to Animal Empathy and Handle Animal skills.

# Good Reputation [General]

The character gains an initial +5 to his initial respect score (see Social Status, Respect, and Favors), also the character will never lose more than five points of respect due to the effects of time.

# Greedy [General]

The character must make a will save vs. DC 15 to make a choice between wealth and honor.

# Hard Luck [Defect]

The character starts with a –3 penalty to his initial circle, only gains a circle once every two levels, and starts with half normal money.

# High Clan [General]

**Requirements:** Special

With this feat the character is of high or higher clan. Roll percentile dice: **01-03** Imperial Tlakótani, **04-30** Very High, **31-00** High.

**Note:** The GM can make this feat free if it is appropiate to the campaign, or even eliminate the random roll and make it 1 feat per level. After 1 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) level the character can not use this to rise above high clan without an imperial edict. The cost in kaitárs is equal to the character’s shamtlá plus the base shamtlá (for a medium lineage) of his new clan.

**Clan and Starting Money:** A character of high clan starts with x2 starting money, of very high clan x5, and of the imperial clan x8 starting money.

# High Lineage [General]

The character starts in either a **01-15** Very High Lineage or **16-00** a High Lineage. The character then gains x1.5 starting money for high or x2.5 for very high (this is cumulative with high clan, above). The character is also seated higher than other clan members at dinner and has more responsibility in the clan. The GM can eliminate the random roll and just make it one feat per lineage level.

# Highly Skilled [General]

The character gains 5 extra skill points. The character can only buy this once, plus an additional time per age category over adulthood. It can only be bought at 1 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) level.

# Improved Initiative [General]

This feat also applies in social situtations when the character must make a witty comeback or to extracate himself from a social faux pax.

# Impulsive [Defect]

The character must make a will check vs. DC 15 to avoid being provoked or to show strong emotions and cannot read people, suffering a –4 penalty to sense motive checks. He also suffers a –4 will save against fear effects.

# Indecisive [Defect]

The character has a –4 initiative penalty and the character cannot make up his mind easily.

# Low Clan [Defect]

The character is **01-30** Low Clan or **31-00** Very Low Clan.

**Note:** Characters with this defect should never be in the same party with characters with the High Clan feat.

# Low Lineage [Defect]

The character is **01-30** Low Lineage or **31-00** Very Low Lineage. The character’s starting money is multiplied by x0.75 (Low) or x0.5 (Very Low). The character is also seated lower than other clan members and is rarely placed in a position of power in the clan.

# Magic Damper [General]

This feat may be taken only by Humans, Ahoyggá, Shén, and Swamp Folk. No spell can be cast within 5 feet of the possessor of this feat (though magic will affect him normally if it originates outside this area, however a caster cannot cast a touch spell outside the area and then try to touch the target with this feat). The character cannot be scanned via magic or psionic detection.

**Note:** The character loses all spell casting ability if he gains this feat. The character cannot take the spell battery feat. A spellcaster may overcome this by making a level check vs. DC 25 per casting, thus a 1 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) to 4 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) level caster automatically fails to cast spells within range of the character.

# Nemesis [Defect]

The character starts with an enemy determined by the GM.

# Older [Defect]

Everytime the character buys this defect he is one age category older than normal and suffers the normal penalties and gains the normal bonuses in addition to gaining an extra feat.

# Permanent Disability [Defect]

The character permanently suffers a –2 penalty as per the Damage to specific areas variant in the DMG pg. 66. The character should pick one location on Table 3-9 (note: a disabled foot or leg also gives a –5’ penalty to movement rate). It should not be one curable by magic

# Poor [Defect]

The character has x0.25 starting wealth and is unable to accumlate wealth.

# Responsibilities [Defect]

The character has obligations to his family. Also the character must spend the maximum possible skill points on his clan’s profession and must buy skill focus for it also.

# Second Class Citizen [Defect]

The character is a foreigner, clan-woman, nakomé or manumitted slave. The character suffers a –3 penalty to reactions, and except for the clan woman, starts with a 0 social status (a clan woman starts with normal social status).

# Shadow Scars [Defect]

The character frequently wakes from nightmares (Will DC 15 or lose one nights sleep per week), cannot dream normally, and may have waking nightmares when under stress. The character will suffer fatigue if he loses a night’s sleep or when suffering from waking nightmares. The character cannot take this with Harmony of the Five Selves.

# Spell Battery [General]

**Requirement:** Spell casting attribute of 16+

If the character is a spell caster, this feat has no effect. If the character is not a spell caster then any ritual or psychic mage within 5 feet of the character can add the spell battery’s “bonus spells” (subtract four from ability as per spellcasters) to the spellcaster’s own when using magic. Characters who have to prepare spells must have the spell battery with them at all times until they discharge the bonus spells. A caster cannot benefit from more than one spell battery at a time.

**Note:** The character cannot have the Magic Dampner feat. If the character chooses later to become a spell caster, he gains nothing to replace this feat and ceases to be a spell battery (his own spell casting ability becomes tied up in spells). The character can only buy this at 1 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) level.

# Ugly [Defect]

The character is far from the norms of Tsolyanu society, either in general ugliness or if the character has blue eyes.

# Uneducated [Background]

The character gains half starting skill points (double starting points instead of x4) and must pay double cost for all knowledges. The character gains a +2 bonus to constitution.

**Unusual Languages [General]**

You may learn Sunúz or the Language of the priests of Ksarúl. You do not get both (only one per instance of buying the feat) nor do you gain any ranks in the language (skill points must be spent on it). You just gain the ability to buy the language.

# Wealth [General]

The character starts with twice starting money and has an income equal to his normal starting money. The wealth modifiers from High Clan and High Lineage only affect starting wealth.

# Younger [Background]

The character is 12 or younger. She starts with half starting skill points (double instead of x4, cumulative with uneducated, which will only give the character x1 base points), and is a minor by Tsolyanu law and custom. The character gains a +2 bonus to dexterity, which she will lose when she reaches adulthood.

# Alignment

The standard nine alignments exists in Tekumél, but the people of this world are not concerned with the struggle between good and evil. Law (Stability) and Chaos (Change) are of far greater importance in this world. Nobility of action determines how society looks at him. Integrity is far more important (if you say you’re evil, act it). The worst villians in this world are hypocrites. The various societies on this world are Lawful Neutral with strong Neutral tendencies. However, true Neutrals are rare except among nonhumans and a person that does not align himself with the various powers and changes temple alliegeance like the wind is a very dishonorable person (and will probably wind up poor paying all those temple donations).

# Spell Lists

The list will be expanded as time permits. Note: spells dealing with elementals or riding creatures absolutely do not exist.

**Note on spell names:** Names are different in EPT, magic missile is the missile of Mettaljá, the Globes of Invulnerability are the Muniments of Excellence, and the various Bigby Hand spells are renamed the Hand of Krá the Mighty among other examples.
