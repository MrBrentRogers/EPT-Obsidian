Tactical Magic of the Five Empires

Spell casters in the Tsolyanu army can have the opportunity to be part of a magical contingent. The basic of which is the spell caster being used as magical psychic energy resource that can be channeled to more powerful spell casters.

Tactical Magic uses the Spell Points Variant form the DMG5e (p.288) in addition to the sorcerer’s Metamagic ability to twist and expand spells (PHB 101).

All Tactical Magic requires spells to be Upcast as 10 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) level spells and cast as ritual spells (10 mins to cast). Tactical Magic also uses the mean average of spell damage, so a Tactical Magic Fireball is cast as a 10 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) level spell 15d6 Fire Damage for an average of 60 Fire damage, save for half (60/30).

Tactical Magic is also measured in meters, not feet.

When a main caster chooses what spell and effects he wants to happen, the spell point total of those powering the spell is figured out and cast, then calculations are made if there is enough spell points from the pool of resources to have the spell take effect.

# Deeds of Glory Spell Conversion

Generic and Temple spells can only be learned from appropriate temples. Temple spells are only taught to high level spell casters of that temple sect.

Spell Points & Sorcery Points are treated as the same.

# Spell DC

Spell DC: Use that of the Main Caster who casts the spell(s) when saving throws are required.

# Metamagic

All Metamagics can be stacked and used multiple times in Tactical Magic. These are variants to Metamagic found under The Sorcerer in the PHB p.101. These changes allow for the easier conversion of D&D5e spells to be converted into Tactical Magic.

## Careful Spell

1 sorcery point to allow someone to auto-save against the spell. 36 SP per 10m radius of area of effect.

## Distant Spell

1 sorcery point to double the starting range. 2SP = Range x 3. Etc. Touch spells gain a range of 10m (30’) for 1 Sorcery Point

## Empowered Spell

1 sorcery point per dice is spent to increase the damage by 1 point per dice. Cost is always the amount of dice of damage (cast as Spell-level 10).

## Enlarged Spell

1 sorcery point to increase the Area of effect 10 feet (3sp to increase AoE 10m).

## Extended Spell

1 sorcery point to double the duration of a spell. (example: 1min to 10 mins = 10sp)

## Heightened Spell

3 sorcery points to make targets have disadvantage vs saving throw. 100 SP per 10m radius of area of effect.

## Twinned Spell

Spend same amount of spell points again to target a second group at range. This can be used to stack the effects of a spell in the same area. See Exertions of the God-King as an example

# Tactical Spells

## Lens of Power

_2 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]])-level evocation (ritual)_

**Casting Time**: 10 minutes

**Range**: 15 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a magnifying glass)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 hour

This spell permits the caster to focus their psychic energy to enhance the strength on a high order spell by deliberately focusing of psychic energy by lesser mages to increase the strength of military spells cast by more powerful spell casters.

The caster deliberately allows another spell caster to use their spell slots. The receiving spell caster chooses what spell they want to cast at what level, and then splits the cost among everyone who has focused Lens of Power on them. If there is not enough spell points available, the spell fails and everyone losses the highest level spell slot that is currently available.

Only wizards who have cast The Summit of the Mountain of Power can utilize spell points focused upon them.

**Spell Power Surge**. If a spell caster receives more spell points than they can handle, they take 1d6 radiant damage per spell point received. They must then make a Concentration Check to see if their spell succeeded or failed. Example: A 5 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) level wizard casts an Upcast, Distant, & Empowered 5 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]])-lvl Fireball (9 spell points), and is the focus of 10x 3 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]])-lvl spell casters (30 spell points being sent). The 5 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) lvl wizard can handle a max of 27 Spell Points so they would take 3d6 radiant damage, followed by a concentration check, and then the spell effect could happen.

**At Higher Levels**. When this spell is cast at higher levels, the range spells can be sent increases by 15 feet, and the spell level that can be sent is the spell level Lens of Power was cast at or lower.

When Lens of Power is cast as a 8 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) level or higher, the caster also leeches the psychic magical energy of everything within 15 feet, allowing them to recover up to half your level in spell slots as if you had Arcane Recovery (PHB 115). This use of Arcane Recovery can be used as once per spell level over 7 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) (8 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) once, 9 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) twice, 10 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) thrice).

## The Summit of the Mountain of Power

_3 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]])-level evocation (ritual)_

**Casting Time**: 10 minutes

**Components**: V, S, M (a load stone)

**Duration**: 10 minutes

The caster is able to receive psychic spell points to strengthen and subsequently cast military spells. The caster can receive up to 30 spell points at any moment in time. The spell-caster can then modify any spell and all spells are Upcast as if cast using a 10 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) level spell slot.

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) lvel or higher, the caster can receive an additional 10 spell points per level.

Spell Casters commonly Cast Summit at their lowest level first, then with their new pool of spell points recast this spell as a Tactical Spell (10 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) level spell) as well as Extend and Twin the spell to get more life out of it.
