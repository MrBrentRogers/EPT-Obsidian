## Artillery and Bombarding

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Artillery and Bombarding**|**D&D Damage**|**Notes**|
|High Explosive||These shells are more than capable of destroying infantry units and even vehicles through their sheer explosive force.|
|Fragmentation||Fragmentation Rounds are timed charge shells that explode before hitting the ground and shower the area with shrapnel. These shells are employed against large numbers of closely-packed infantry.|
|Siege Shells||Siege Shells are used against enemy structures and fortifications. They are fused to explode after hitting the ground, causing damage to the building's foundation.|
|Melta Shells||Melta Shells undergo a sub-atomic reaction upon impact and release a blast of intense heat. They are capable of doing tremendous damage to armoured units and infantry alike.|
|Inferno Rounds||Inferno Round shells are packed with a highly flammable substance such as an oxy-phospur gel or a thermite compound, causing everything in the vicinity of its explosion to burst into flame. This fire is difficult to extinguish and its flammable gel will stick to most surfaces. As a result, most infantry and vehicles will retreat when faced with a concentrated barrage of Inferno Rounds.|
|Illumination Shells||Illumination shells are fired high into the air on a parabolic arc where they deploy a parachute and slowly drift downwards. The shell burns very brightly on its way down to illuminate the battlefield for night operations.|
|Smoke Shells||Smoke Shells cover the impact area with a dense layer of smoke which is used to conceal the location of friendly forces.|

### HsE = Humanspace Empire

### Shield belt

A belt that creates a scintillating force field around the wearer that absorbs and deflects some energy and projectiles. The effects are cumulative with other armor. The bonus is also added to any area of effect saving throws as well. They come in two versions Mark I (+1) and Mark II (+2).

## Light Armor

### Heavy Clothing

Heavy clothing is advanced clothing that adds some level of protection without limiting any mobility of the wearer.

### Skin suit

Skin suit: Skin-suits are super-scientific form-fitting, light weight space suits with a bubble hood. They are generally no bulkier than standard clothing; however the wearer suffers no effects from vacuum, gas or disease so long as the suit has not been breached. A suit is breached when the wearer takes damage. Skin suits have limited self-sealing capability and breaches will be repaired on a roll of 1-2 on a 1d6.

## Medium Armor

### Still suit

Still-suits are tight fitting garments made of a synthetic osmotic equipped with waste water recycling systems to maximize recovery of all water loss. Assuming any atmospheric water is present an individual wearing a properly fitted suit can subsist on recovered water indefinitely. These suits do not protect against vacuum or extremes of heat and cold but provide some armor protection.

## Heavy Armor

### Space armor:

Three types of armored space suits are available on super-scientific worlds, light, medium, and heavy space armor. All three types include an armored helmet and are equipped with powered exoskeleton that increases the strength in the wearer.

This equipment in light armor merely offsets the weight of the suit.

Heavy and medium armor confer an effective STR of 18 on the wearer.

Space armor is breached when the wearer takes damage: however these suits have excellent self-sealing capability. Breaches will be repaired on a roll of 1 -8 on a 1d10 for light armor and on a roll of 1-9 on a 1d10 for medium or heavy armor.

### Spacesuit

Spacesuits are considerably bulkier than form fitting skin suits and include a body suit, gauntlets, boots, and a bubble helmet. The wearer suffers no effects from gas or disease so long as the suit has not been breached, A suit is breached when the wearer takes damage.

Advanced spacesuits have limited self-repair capability and breaches will be repaired on a roll of 1 or 2 on a 1d6. Super-scientific space suits repair breaches on a roll of 1-3 on a 1d6
