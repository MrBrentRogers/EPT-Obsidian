**Setting**: Jakálla on the 2nd of Drénggar. Primary rituals are held on the 2nd, along with sacrifices and orgies. Inner temple services and private parties continue throughout the week.

On the periphery, all is happy, raucous, and celebratory. If you go deeper and explore the extent of the holiday attractions, displays, stages, and booths, prepare for some shocking, if not outright horrifying experiences. Jakálla is the populous center of the worship of Hriháyal on Tékumel, and her rituals range from the tame to the extreme!

Inspiration – the Folsom Street Fair in San Francisco

## Themes of the street celebrations

### Feasting (Map area 1a (vh), 1b (h), 1c (m), 1d (l), 1e (vl))

The avenue leading up to the Bridge of the Splendour of the Gods in lined with food vendors on the northeast side under the pillared colonnades. The vendors cater to specific clientele by status.

Bakers, gourmet food providers, fish, meats, Jakállan cuisine and delicacies from other lands. The chefs of Jakálla outdo themselves for this holiday. You will find towering confections, rivers of sauce as the moat around castles made of pastry and sweetmeat, giant roasting Tsi’il beasts dripping with delicious spices.

### Drinking and drugs (Map area 2a (vh), 2b (h), 2c (m), 2d (l), 2e (vl))

Wine, drink, and drug vendors abound, but are primarily located on the southwest side of the avenue leading up to the Bridge of the Splendour of the Gods under the pillared colonnades. The vendors cater to specific clientele by status.

#### Orgy of Mornén (Map area 2f)

In one square (between the temples of Drá and Durritlámish), a drunken orgy in honor of Mornén (the paragon of inebriation, and user of powerful drugs, essences, and perfumes) will progress throughout the event. Priests and priestesses will occasionally move those who have lost consciousness to the edges of the square. Many worshippers are naked and entwined upon the wine-splattered flagstones beneath the image of Mornén on her throne in the square.

### Medical Attention (Map area 3)

The Temple of Avánthe maintains medical facilities for those festivalgoers who take things a little too far.

### Crazy costumes (Map area 4)

This area is devoted to the sale of costumes, mostly outlandish headdresses and exaggerated sexual stuff.

The priests and priestesses represent strongly this aspect of the holiday, but not far behind them are worshippers and laity. Worshippers of the Aspect Eshqúra (The Lover of All Things: She is the patron of odd sex, and various fetishes that appeal to some devotees. Her followers are those devoted to certain fabrics or leather, various types or articles of dress, coprophagy, and many other fetishistic items) will be present, in all types of fetish dress, such as leathers, armor crafted so one can engage in sexual acts, strap-ons, animal tails and ears, and other outlandish garb.

### Sex toys sales (Map area 5)

Sex toys for sale. Small chance of finding something really interesting.

### Watersports (Map area 6)

One somewhat removed area has a privy of sorts where worshippers of Okóhk (the patroness of coprophages and those who drink or bathe in urine) gather to engage in their rituals with any who need to relieve themselves, and are willing. A display of frolicking worshippers is often on stage nearby, which serves to indicate what transpires within. For the very brave, several Ahoggyá have been recruited. Not for the faint of heart!

### Homosexuality (Map Area 7)

These areas are separated between male (to the south) and female (to the north) participants, and feature demonstrations of homosexual acts, and as one progresses into the area participants are welcomed.

#### The Hole of Illimitable Glory (Map Area 7a)

A very popular booth with anonymous “portals”. Apparently a popular attraction throughout the known history of the holiday. The nicer inner chambers require a small donation, but the ones around the outside are free to all participants.

### Xenophilia (Map area 8)

These displays will involve members of the friendly races, beginning with them demonstrating mating with one another, and farther down the street, with humans and other friendly races. Shén, Ahoggyá, Swamp Folk, Páchi Léi and Pé Chói participants are seen. A tank with a Nyaggá is also available with priests and priestesses of Avánthe ready to cast “Breath of the Goddess” for a small donation.

### Bestiality (Map area 9)

These displays will feature animals mating with one another, including Rényu, Chnéhl, etc. Farther down the street priests and priestesses of Hriháyal will be participating, and at the end of the street participants are welcomed from the audience. No animals are compelled or harmed in any way whatsoever during these activities!

#### The “Milking of the Bull Chlén” (Map Area 9a)

Performed by a priestess who is all greased up and accompanied by wild music. Watch out for the splash!

### S&M displays and interactive demonstrations (Map area 10)

Beginning east of the temple of Chiténg, are whipping posts, elaborate ropings and restraints, chains, etc. Wrapping around the southern end of the temple are the most extreme forms of this such as ritual piercings (very little to no blood!). The scenes which allow participants to join are mostly fun and light, but some of the demos are more extreme. Submissive and dominant training is available. You get to pick the level of training which you believe you can endure. Roll to determine your success. The DM should roll to see if the master or mistress listens to the request, or goes beyond.

- Two Shén beating tied participant with their tails.
- A Hláka using it’s tail to gently carve patterns into various body parts.
- A Potence spell is cast on a person then their engorged genitals are beaten.
- While tethered to the ground, a spell of Aeriality is cast and the participant is then pelted with small Chlén-hide balls.
- A Darkness spell is cast on a chained participant and the masters/mistresses use various implements to terrify him or her.

### Musicianship and singing (Map Area 11)

Truly incredible displays of musical talent will be present, and wealthy patrons can hear master musicians and singers, among the greatest living.

### Dance (Map Area 12)

These include ritual dances which enthrall the watcher. Some of the dances mimic non-human movement, like that of a serpent, Hawt!

#### The Pavilion of Ultimate Temptation (Map Area 12a)

Only for the wealthy, this breezy conglomeration of silken tents will be the setting in which the players may experience dancers in whom the Spirit of Aládh (She Who Dances, the Dancer of Ultimate Temptation, the Lady of Sensuality and Rhythm) has fully manifested. Viewers of these performances will be imbued with physical ecstasy. This is real, powerful magic.

### Pleasure Cruises (Map area 13)

One may take ship from the docks near the House of the Pleasant Hour #77, to the docks at the Temple of Dlamélish. Individual boats are given over to particular themes, and make a lazy circuit about once an hour. One boat is all about costumes, another S&M, etc.

## The Rituals of the Unveiling

As players move around the holiday grounds, the DM will queue certain parades and processions.

### The Parade and Gifting of Niyunén (Parade route GN)

This procession officially opens the festival in the morning. The back-to-back statue of Niyunén (beautiful human female with glowing eyes and full lips, and sorrowful old woman filled with misery, but commanding and matronly) is carried along the avenue leading up to the Bridge of the Splendour of the Gods, across the bridge and over to the Temple of Dlamélish. The hands of the statue are upraised and drop tiny copper coins with her dual image imprinted on them. Some few silver and gold coins are also included to lend excitement. Players may get jostled if they get close. The parade is accompanied by loud musicians and sensual dancers.

### The Procession and Adoration of Nukhér (Parade route AN)

Mid-day, an open palanquin with a pale nude girl wearing emerald bracelets and a silver collar leads a procession of cages filled with persons singled out for the terrifying rituals associated with the Aspect Nukhér, patroness of cannibalism and necrophilia. This procession leads from the Temple of Dlamélish to the Temple of Hriháyal. Musical bells and cymbals clash as slaves draw the carts forward toward the Temple grounds. These drugged unfortunates will be eaten alive during the orgy with these celebrants! Perhaps the girl at the head of the procession takes notice of one of the players and smiles sensuously, revealing teeth which have been all sharpened to points!

### The Procession and Erection of Shóhla (Parade route ES)

In the evening, this parade, devoted to Shóhla the Priapist, leaves the Temple of Dlamélish and processes to the House of the Pleasant Hour. It consists of male worshippers who dance in this procession to regain their virility. Any of the players who have been feeling a little flaccid lately are welcome to join the parade, but there is an 85% chance that the person you had your eye on earlier notices you in the procession, and gives you a dismissive glance of pity. They say it happens to 4 out of 5 men, just not HER men.

### The Summoning of Rü’ütlánesh

This would be the culmination of the festivities for most holidays. The clanmaster of the Golden Bough Clan in Jakálla to invites the players to represent the clan at the ritual summoning of Rü’ütlánesh in the Temple of Dlamélish.

In a most secret apartment, preferable beneath a temple of the Dark Lady herself, her servitors prepare the way. A chamber or cavern is constructed in the northern wall, and this is purified with a solution of two parts blood to one part water, the latter being taken from a well in the earth, which no human hand has touched. Then the corners of the apartment are sprinkled with drops of black blood [venous blood?], and the seed of males is also released into these corners upon the floor. The smaller chamber in the wall is treated likewise. In the larger, outer chamber the diagramme of the Eye of the Emerald Lady is made upon the paving, for this pattern has much to commend it with the Lords of the Land of Qélem. The pattern is made of powdered emerald or chalcedony mixed with white clay and touched with the Nméreng Stone [a ritual gem, probably green fire-opal]. Around this pattern is made another, tided the Protections of the Wise, done in red ochre, tallow, the grease from a slain infant, and other substances which will be known to those who have the knowledge of the Arts.

When these things are in readiness, all will repair to the larger chamber. Those with the evocator--or evocatress-shall wear no garments, for mighty Rü'ütlánesh hates aught which is woven and those items in which two things cross one another[?]. The Demon Lord loves the sight of rich gems and jewelry, however, and thus each male and female shall be decked in splendid ornaments: ears, nose, hair, throat, wrists, ankles, and other organs shall each be dusted with powdered green emerald and gold dust, and they shall be hung with gems, pendants, bracelets, coronets, and all manner of adornments.

It is necessary to provide the Terror of Qélem with his sustenance. This is not easy, for his sacrifices must be young men and young women who are in their adulthood but who have not cohabited with any person. They must be perfect and clean of limb, the best which the Potter of All has fashioned. They must be beautiful of features, tall and slender, and of rich and ruddy [the meaning of the Engsvanyáli word is not clear] hue. For this calling, the Temple of Dlamélish will utilize three males and three females. These sacrifices shall have the hair of their bodies removed, they shall be anointed in fine oils, and they are to be bound with fetters of silver (for great Rü'ütlánesh despises iron, nor cares he overmuch for copper or bronze). These persons are laid in pairs, one male and one female, in the northern part of the chamber: one in the center in front of the smaller cavity constructed there in the wall, and one pair each at the sides somewhat back from the first. Thus it must be.

At the appointed hour the evocator stands forth from those present. If this be a man, then his ornaments are to be of emerald and turquoise and silver; if a woman, then of emerald and lapis lazuli and fire-opal and silver. The evocator shall step to the front of the diagramme of the Eye of the Emerald Lady and call out in a loud voice,

"Let the way be opened unto mighty Qélem! Let the Barrier Gods of the Nine Pylons be silent! Let the Gates of lron Fangs be made open! Let the Names of the Guardians of the Path be said unto them! Let there be a reaching unto far Qélem and an obeisance at the feet of that Lord who dwells beyond the Tenth Pylon, so that the One we seek may come forth unto us!"

Then all of those present-up to any number which the apartment can hold, so long as there are not exactly thirty-three persons, a number hateful to Demons – shall begin the Litany of Summoning [in Bednálljan Salarvyáni]:

“Otuléngba, all hail! Otuléngba, all glory!

Victory upon the Night of Power!

Mastery unto the One Who Comes Forth!

Eater of Entrails, One of Mouths, Famished One!

We call unto you! We supplicate you! We serve you!

Otuléngba! Great Rü'ütlánesh! Homage unto your eternal power!"

Let this chant begin slowly and dolefully. Then let the leader thereof speed its tempo, over and over, in a low voice at first, then louder, and then even greater, until it reaches a crescendo. Let those who sing sway with their chanting, touching their bodies together, chanting and stamping their feet so that their anklets clash and ring. Let all of this be done even while the evocator calls repeatedly upon the Demon Lord, as given above.

It is a far passage unto the Land of Qélem, and time is required for the calling. None shall cease the chant, nor shall any person break it with a cough or sneeze or anything untoward. Should this occur, let his fellows slay him at once, lest all be similarly taken. In any case, such an accident will cause the ceremony to be broken off, and it cannot then be resumed that night.

As the chant quickens, the darkness will pulsate strangely with its rhythm. The little chamber in the northern wall will flicker and grow illumined, then dark, then pearly grey, then murky brown. At last a greenness will flow forth into the room, filling it with coils like incense smoke, but with an odour which is acrid and dank and repugnant. Still let the chanting be maintained without ceasing.

Great Lord Rü'ütlánesh will now become manifest in the cavity in the northern wall, as is attested by all who have attended these rites. Hideous is his coming, for there is a sensation as of the release of one's sexual ecstasies, yet this is not so in reality. Then there is a feeling of lassitude and a weariness which surpasses all wearinesses. A yearning for surrender, as of a beloved who approaches her lover, shall come upon all, and many will sway and fall within the patterns, rolling rhythmically upon the paving stones. The evocator, however, must be strong and steadfast in the forefront, maintaining the Litany of Summoning.

Then the Demon Lord manifests himself fully. There is a sound as of some stupendous beast breathing and also a sense of red lust and passion greater than one has ever known. The eyes are blinded with fervor, and voluptuousness rises to an unbearable pitch, yet ever with an underlying threnody of horror just beyond the limit of one's brain. None can describe it completely. Only an experience of it can make it fully known, and it is not a condition which one cares to endure again.

When the Mighty One is fully present, the evocator shall raise his left hand and indicate the pair of sacrifices upon the floor to the left. There then occurs a flowing forth, and one will perceive many tiny scarlet mouths opening up on all parts of the Demon Lord's body. There are no eyes, no face, but only a multitude of tiny sucking, mewling mouths. These will touch and caress the offerings, leaving everywhere great red weals and bloody wounds. Yet the victims will know it not; they will couple together and jerk and writhe in an ecstasy of pleasure. The mouths of the demon Lord will cover them entirely, and they will be engulfed. Their limbs will raise and lower and tremble beneath the horrid carpet of mouths. At length one will behold their flesh withering away and their bodily fluids emerging through raw and naked gashes in their skins. The victims are deliquesced before one's eyes, and their substances are taken up into the being of Lord Rü'ütlánesh. At last naught is left but the bones and a wrinkled, shriveled shell. A sight more horrid cannot be found.

When the Demon Lord has finished with this pair of sacrifices, then shall the evocator signal to those who chant, and they shall become silent. Then the former shall perform the Hymn to the Night of the Soul, which provides for the next act of the ceremony. [This again seems to be taken from The Scroll of Inimical Sendings, Canticle IV, Stanzas 8-9, cf. above].

"Feed upon the joy of life, feel its presences within your being!

Go down in to the Pool of Misty Water in your Land of Qélem!

Go forth into the forest of many branchings and seek your prey!

For you are the hunter, and the hunt is all your rejoicing and your glory!

Beyond the ends of time do you dwell, and yours is the power forever!

Feed upon what is offered here that we may worship you!

For we serve you, O Master of Qélem, in the Darkness Which Shall Be!

Let it be the Eternal Night of the Soul!"

Then shall the second pair of sacrifices be offered similarly, being those placed to the northeast. Those who chant shall now repeat over and over the Words of Power:

"Neskolém, Vayoném, Hikótumè."

These are the secret Names of the One of Mouths.

When the second couple has been received, the paving will run with their life-fluids, and mighty Rü'ütlánesh will leave their crumpled shells to return to his place, then shall the evocator again signal to those who chant, and they shall become silent.

Now those who perform the rites will again feel the surge of wild ecstasy and sensual joy which overcomes all logic, reason, and the instincts of life itself. It is impossible to resist, and all will enter into an orgy of indulgence. Many will fall unknowing and uncaring of what is done upon their persons. Again there will come a lassitude of satiety, and the party will arise and prostrate themselves before the Lord. The evocator shall gesture to the third pair of sacrifices, those directly before the cavity in the northern wall, with his right hand, and he shall say [in Bednálljan Salarvyáni]:

"Who has fed shall feed once more;

Who has been worshipped shall rise again in majesty,

Adored forever by those who serve, ever and ever eternally!

Who has come forth shall rejoice at the repast;

Who has satiated the Glorious One shall enjoy the ecstasy of service!

Who has done obeisance shall be given the strength to enjoy again!

Forever and for all time, perpetually and everlastingly!"

Now will the Demon Lord move to seize upon the third couple. Under the caressings of the mouths these shall rise to perform delights and abominations upon one another. The lash of ecstasy will raise them to all of the heights of pleasure. And as they do, so shall those who observe do likewise. For the third sacrifice creates within the hearts of men and women the most powerful and undeniable lusts which any human can experience. Raw, naked, untrammeled and unleavened by reason or by pity, this emotion sweeps away all before it and ends at last in an exhaustion so profound that none can rise, nor speak, nor possess the strength to disentangle oneself from one's partner. Now, also, is the time of greatest danger! The lassitude of which I have spoken creates a deep and troublous sense of emptiness, of depression, and of unease. The vanity of existence and the meaninglessness of all human sentiments and endeavors rises before one's eyes, and all who are there must cry out in their grief and hopelessness. Those who have strength have been known to slash at their own throats with bared nails or with the sharp edge of some ornament. Others swallow their tongues or attempt to strangle themselves, while some plead for the kind aid of a friend or lover in their yearning for self-destruction. It is in this fashion that the Lord of Qélem gains further servitors, for those who succeed in this death are translated directly into his bondage in the Land of Qélem.

During this period the Great One shall slowly retreat within the cavity in the northern wall. When the evocator and his party have regained their senses and their wills, they will behold the Demon Lord to be gone. There is thus no need to end the ritual or to provide a means of dispelling this Lord, for he departs of himself. None may leave the pattern while he is manifest, but once he has accepted the sacrifices and departed, it is safe for all to go.
