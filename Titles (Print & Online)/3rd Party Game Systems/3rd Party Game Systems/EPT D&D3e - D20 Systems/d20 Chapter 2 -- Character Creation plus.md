[H1] Character Creation

Designing a character for Tékumel d20 is your chance, as a player, to have some input into the style of game you will be playing, and the kind of stories you will be telling. If you want plenty of battles – play a warrior; if temple intrigue is more your thing, create a political-oriented priest. You may be playing this character a while, so do take the time to personalise her, adding quirks and thinking about her past history as well as her current aims. Do talk to the GM, too, particularly if you have any questions.

[H2] Character Classes

All Tékumel d20 characters come from one of the following character classes: Entertainer, Expert, Guard, Labourer, Legionary, Merchant, Noble, Scout, or Sorcerer.

[H4] Characteristics

[H4] Other Classes

[H4] Hit Dice and Ability Scores

The Entertainer uses d8 Hit Dice.

All Entertainers have need of Charisma more than any other Ability Score. They always rely on personal interaction, even those whose entertainment work is also a cover for less socially approved activities. Depending on the Entertainer’s clan and the precise nature of his or her profession, almost any other Ability Score can also be useful, but Entertainers with a reasonable score in Intelligence, Wisdom, and Dexterity are common.

[H4] Class Skills and Skill Points

The Entertainer’s class Skills (and the key Ability for each) are: Balance (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Bribe (Cha), Climb (Str), Concentration (Con), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Gather Information (Cha), Hide (Dex), Jump (Str), Knowledge: Foreign Culture (Int), Knowledge: Geography (Int), Knowledge: History (Int), Knowledge: Local (Int), Knowledge: Religion (Int), Move Silently (Dex), Perform: Any (Cha), Seduce (Cha), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Speak Languages (None), Teamwork (Wis), Tumble (Dex), Melee Attack, Ranged Attack, and Unarmed Attack.

• Skill Points at 1st Level = (8 + Int Modifier) x 4

• Skill Points at Each Additional Level = 8 + Int modifier

Background (Ex): The Entertainer may select one of the following Backgrounds at 1st level. New Backgrounds can be devised at the GM’s discretion.

_Musician:_ Musicians are valued throughout Tékumel, with everyone from peasants to princes enjoying a good tune. A musician gains a +2 bonus on all Perform checks relating to any musical instrument (including song).

At 4th level and every three levels thereafter, the musician may choose one additional musical instrument to learn. The musician immediately gains a sufficient number of Ranks in Perform with the chosen instrument to match his or her highest Perform skill. This skill increases in step with the highest Perform rank, without any need to spend additional skill points.

_For example, Terutra is a musician who always keeps her Perform (drum) at the maximum possible, by spending one skill point to increase her Perform (drum) Rank by one each time she rises in level. Thus at 3rd level she has +6 Ranks in Perform (drum), but no other Perform skills. On attaining 4th level she spends a skill point to increase her Perform (drum) ranks to +7, but she also gains +7 ranks in another musical instrument. She chooses Perform (harp), and so she now has Perform (drum) +7 and Perform (harp) +7. When she reaches 5th level, she spends another skill point to increase her Perform (drum) skill to +8, and her Perform (harp) skill also increases to +8. At 7th level, she will have Perform (harp) +10 and Perform (drum) +10, and may choose a further Perform skill, perhaps Perform (song) +10._

_Prostitute:_ Prostitutes are found at all levels of Tsolyáni society, from the slave girls hired out by the lowest merchant caravan to high-clan sacred whores dedicated to Dlamélish. A Prostitute gains a +3 bonus on all Seduce checks.

At 4th level, the prostitute learns to use his or her seductive ways and knowledge of others’ desires to influence them in more subtle ways. This can affect any heterosexual characters of the opposite sex to the prostitute, homosexual characters of the same sex, or bisexual characters of either sex. The prostitute gains a +4 bonus with any one Charisma-based skill (other than Seduce), as chosen by the player, when the target, audience, or other creature affected is an appropriate character. At 7th level and every three levels thereafter, the prostitute gains a +4 bonus with another Charisma-based skill in the same circumstances.

_Thief:_ Professional thieves are non-existent in Tsolyáni society. However, certain Entertainers supplement their legitimate income by a small amount of stealing, since their profession gives them many opportunities to plan and carry out theft (as well as to leave town afterwards without appearing any more suspicious than usual). Add Open Lock (Dex) to the Entertainer’s list of Class Skills.

At 4th level, add Disable Device (Int) to the Entertainer’s list of Class Skills. At 7th level, the Entertainer gains a +1 Trap Sense, giving her a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. At 10th level and every three levels thereafter, the Trap Sense bonuses increase by +1.

_Poisoner:_ Entertainers are accused of being poisoners almost as often as they are of being thieves. In most cases neither accusation is accurate, but it is true that there are a few entertainers who will mix a deadly brew for a client unable to afford to go to one of the sanctioned Assassins’ Clans. Add Poisons (Int) to the Entertainer’s list of Class Skills.

At 4th level, add Craft: Apothecary (Int) to the Entertainer’s list of Class Skills. At 7th level, the poisoner no longer risks poisoning him- or herself when preparing poison. At 10th level, the Entertainer gains a +2 bonus to all Poisons checks. At 13th level, the Entertainer gains a +2 bonus to all Craft: Apothecary checks. At 16th level, the Entertainer may craft especially strong poisons at three times the usual cost; these apply a -2 penalty to the target’s saving throw. At 19th level, for ten times the usual cost, the Entertainer may craft a still more concentrated poison that applies a -4 penalty to the target’s saving throw.

_Ritual Priest:_ Every temple recruits charismatic individuals to lead the faithful in worship. Ritual priests are not usually magicians or scholars, but instead devote their lives to bringing others to a greater understanding of their god through dramatic ritual. A ritual priest gains Priest as a bonus feat. At 4th level, the Entertainer gains a +2 bonus to the use of all Charisma-based skills when applied to a worshipper of the same god; at 10th level this bonus increases to +4, and at 16th level to +6. At 7th level, 13th level, and 19th level, the Entertainer gains Promotion: Temple as a bonus feat; if he or she is already 10th circle or higher, select one feat from the Entertainer bonus feat list instead (see below).

Bonus Feat (Ex): At 2nd level, and every four levels thereafter, the Entertainer gains a bonus feat selected from the following list: Acrobatic, Agile, Alertness, Animal Affinity, Athletic, Attractive, Blessed, Concealment, Confident, Creative, Deceptive, Dodge, Flunkies, Focused, Good Reputation, Great Fortitude, Greatly Blessed, Harmony Amongst the Five Selves, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes, Lucky, Nimble, Performer, Skill Focus, Stealthy, Trustworthy.

Distraction/Manipulation (Ex): Distraction/Manipulation may represent oratorical ability, innate charisma, a beautiful or resonant voice, or even a physical performance or show. This Attribute allows a character to distract a number of people or animals at a critical moment, provided he or she has some method of communicating with them (for example, talking, dancing, illusionary image, written word, etc.) If the character is trying to directly distract a potentially hostile group, such as an angry mob or a group of guards, his or her Rank in Distraction/Manipulation dictates how many people are distracted. If the character has an audience that is already prepared to listen, the Rank determines the percentage of that audience that is moved enough to take action, whether that involves signing up for the army, donating money to the Temple, or supporting the character in a legal case.

If multiple people with this Attribute work as a team, the total number of people distracted is added together.

To determine whether Distraction/Manipulation succeeds, the character makes a modified Level check, adding his or her Charisma modifier (1d20 + Entertainer class Level + Charisma). The DC is usually 10 + target’s Wisdom bonus + target’s Level. In the case of a Distraction/Manipulation attempt targeting more than one character, the DC is determined according to the highest level target.

Rank 1 The character can distract one individuals, or 5% of an audience will be motivated.

Rank 2 The character can distract up to two individuals, or 10% of an audience will be motivated.

Rank 3 The character can distract a small crowd (1-10 individuals), or 20% of an audience will be motivated.

Rank 4 The character can distract a medium crowd (11-50 individuals), or 50% of an audience will be motivated.

Rank 5 The character can distract a large crowd (50-200 individuals), or 75% of an audience will be motivated.

Rank 6 The character can distract a very large crowd (200-1000 individuals), or 95-100% of an audience will be motivated.

Contact (Ex): At levels 5, 11, and 17, the Entertainer gains the Contact class feature. The character has a named friend in a position of influence and/or power. The player should develop the friend’s background and personality in consultation with the GM. Friends will go out of their way to help the character, but have other obligations that can interfere with their availability. Furthermore, a character who abuses friendships may find that they become far less useful.

The friend’s actual level of influence should be consistent with the level of the campaign. For example, a rural magistrate is very well-placed to a low-clan person, but not to someone from the Clan of Sea Blue.

Each time the character gains the Contact class feature, he or she may either choose to have a further contact of Type 1 (see below), or improve the influence or disposition of an existing contact by +1 Type. A multiclassed character who gains the Contact class feature from two or more different classes may improve an existing contact or add a new one as usual.

Type 1 The friend is either a good contact (above the character’s rank in one of the professions) or a competent and close ally.

Type 2 The friend is either a very well-placed contact or a close friend with specifically (and frequently) useful Skills.

Type 3 The friend is extremely well placed or notably loyal and courageous, and will put the character’s welfare before the friend’s own. This Type could also represent a group of friends who are not as well placed or loyal but are still ready to help when needed. A Clan Elder or Lineage head could call on this Level of support from a clanhouse.

Work of Renown (Ex): At 8th level, the Entertainer gains the ability to produce a Work of Renown. This might be a play, show, musical composition, or other use of one of his or her relevant skills that will propel the Entertainer’s name into that particular field as a major performance artist. A Work of Renown may be produced by taking at least three months and expending at least 500 Kaitars on materials, research, etc.

The GM and player should consult as to the precise effects of the Work of Renown on play. Its benefits are usually entirely social, being worth perhaps a Medium Favour owed by some influential figure (which might represent the gift of a physical item, or the gratitude of the character for work done, or similar) or even 1 point of Respect.

Masterpiece (Ex): A Masterpiece is similar in nature to a Work of Renown, but will establish the Entertainer as one of the pre-eminent performers in the field. A Masterpiece takes six months and 1,000 Kaitars to produce.

Again the precise effects should be devised with the GM’s assistance, but +6 to relevant skill rolls, +2 to attack rolls, +4 to damage rolls, +4 to saving throws, a Medium Favour owed by a highly influential figure, or 2 points of Respect, are all possibilities.

[H4] Notes

Saving Throws: At 1st level, the Entertainer decides if he or she will have good Will Saving Throws and poor Reflex Saving Throws, or good Reflex Saving Throws and poor Will Saving Throws. Generally, the more cerebral-oriented Entertainers have a high Will Saving Throw, whereas those who rely on quickness, movement, or acrobatic tricks will have a high Reflex Saving Throw. Once the Entertainer has selected which Saving Throws are good and which are poor, he or she may not alter this selection at a later date.

[H3] Expert

[H4] Characteristics

[H4] Other Classes

[H4] Hit Dice and Ability Scores

The Expert uses d8 Hit Dice.

An Expert may focus on any one or several of the Ability Scores, depending on his or her role within society. Intelligence is the most common, particularly for craftsmen, bureaucrats, administrative priests, artists, jurists, scholars and scribes, since all Craft and Knowledge skills are Intelligence-based. Wisdom and Charisma are also useful for almost every Expert, as most will regularly be dealing with people during the course of their work -- whether buying, selling, or organising.

[H4] Class Skills and Skill Points

The Expert may choose any twelve non-combat skills, plus up to two combat skills, to be class skills. These choices are always subject to the GM’s approval, and in some cases the GM may disallow an expert from taking any combat skills as class skills. A player wishing to play an Expert should decide on a character concept and talk it over with the GM so that the two of them can agree on a suitable set of skills. In general, the GM will expect at least six of the chosen class skills to be directly relevant to the chosen profession, and the remaining six to be at least tangentially relevant. Several sample Expert character concepts are given in a sidebar.

Note: An Expert may wish to have more flexibility with some of the catch-all skills. For example, a Scholar should be able to take any Knowledge skill, since he or she is likely to have picked up a smattering of all manner of subjects. In this case, the GM may allow the character to trade four of his or her usual twelve skills for a single Knowledge: Any, Profession: Any, Craft: Any, or Perform: Any option. This variant is used in the sample Scholar character concept in the sidebar.

• Skill Points at 1st Level = (10 + Int Modifier) x 4

• Skill Points at Each Additional Level = 10 + Int modifier

[[[ Begin Sidebar ]]]

[H3] Expert Character Concept Examples

The following character concepts are provided as suggestions. They are easily modified to create slightly variant concepts. For example, an Administrative Priest of XX rather than of YY would have XX rather than YY. Likewise, a Chlén-Hide Worker whose main customers are of high clan might have Diplomacy (Cha) instead of Knowledge: Streetwise (Int).

[H4] Artist

Art objects and other things of beauty are highly valued throughout the Empire of the Petal Throne, and a great artist can find renown as well as riches in providing that art.

_Non-Combat Skills:_ Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Craft: Drawing (Int), Craft: Painting (Int), Craft: Sculpture (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Knowledge: History (Int), Knowledge: Local (Int), Knowledge: Nobility (Int), Knowledge: Streetwise (Int), Search (Int), and Spot (Wis).

_Combat Skills:_ Unarmed Attack and Unarmed Defence.

[H4] Bureaucrat

The Tsolyánu Empire is dependent on a vast number of bureaucrats to keep virtually every imaginable matter running smoothly, from mercantile taxes to the logistics of Sakbé road maintenance.

For an administrative priest instead of an imperial bureaucrat, remove the Knowledge: Nobility skill and replace it with Knowledge: Religion skill. An administrative priest should select the Priest feat as one of his or her starting feats — a character who does not do this will only be an apprentice administrative priest, still in training (and liable to be throw out of the priesthood if he or she does not acquire the Priest feat by 3rd level at the latest).

_Non-Combat Skills:_ Analysis and Planning (Int), Bribe (Cha), Bureaucracy (Int), Concentration (Con), Diplomacy (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge: Business (Int), Knowledge: Local (Int), Knowledge: Mathematics (Int), Knowledge: Nobility (Int), Sense Motive (Wis), and Speak Language (None).

_Combat Skills:_ Unarmed Attack and Unarmed Defence.

[H4] Chlén-Hide Smith-Tanner

Chlén-hide is used by members of all social classes and professions, and so an astute chlén-hide smith-tanner will happily make goods for whoever can pay his or her fee. Like most artisans, though, chlén-hide smith-tanners tend to attract customers appropriate to their own status, so that a Broken Reed smith-tanner will sell to a higher class of buyer than a High Tower smith-tanner.

_Non-Combat Skills:_ Appraise (Int), Craft: Butcher (Int), Craft: Chlén-Hide Worker (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Knowledge: Business (Int), Knowledge: Local (Int), Knowledge: Streetwise (Int), Knowledge: Physical Sciences (Int), Medical (Wis), Search (Int), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spot (Wis).

_Combat Skills:_ Unarmed Attack and Unarmed Defence.

[H4] Diplomat

Diplomats can come from a variety of backgrounds, but almost all are from high or very high clans. The Expert character class can cover both Tsolyáni and foreign diplomats.

Note that diplomats are often given small, compact projectile weapons, sometimes even Eyes, with which to defend themselves while fleeing the area if need be.

_Non-Combat Skills:_ Bluff (Cha), Bribe (Cha), Diplomacy (Cha), Gather Information (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge: Foreign Culture (Int), Knowledge: Geography (Int), Knowledge: Nobility (Int), Knowledge: Tsolyánu Culture (Int), Listen (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Speak Language (None).

_Combat Skills:_ Ranged Attack _or_ Special Ranged Attack, and Unarmed Defence.

[H4] Jeweller

Note that the presence of High Cartography in this jeweller’s skill list marks him or her as a particularly high-clan and knowledgeable jeweller. A lower-clan jeweller, who specialised in making cheap but impressive-looking jewellery for poor weddings, would drop High Cartography and Knowledge: Nobility from the skill list in favour of Gather Information (Cha) and Knowledge: Streetwise (Int).

_Non-Combat Skills:_ Appraise (Int), Bribe (Cha), Craft: Goldsmithing (Int), Craft: Jewellery (Int), High Cartography (Int), Knowledge: Business (Int), Knowledge: Local (Int), Knowledge: Nobility (Int), Knowledge: Physical Sciences (Int), Profession: Miner (Wis), Search (Int), and Spot (Wis).

_Combat Skills:_ Unarmed Attack and Unarmed Defence.

[H4] Jurist

Tsolyáni law is frequently convoluted in application, particularly when Temple Law and other bye-laws are taken into account. Jurists and lawyers are an essential tool of both the Clans and the Temples in ensuring their own interests are served and their rivals’ plots thwarted.

_Skills:_ Analysis and Planning (Int), Bluff (Cha), Bribe (Cha), Diplomacy (Cha), Gather Information (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge: Business (Int), Knowledge: Law (Int), Knowledge: Local (Int), Knowledge: Tsolyáni Culture, Research (Int), and Sense Motive (Wis).

_Combat Skills:_ Unarmed Attack and Unarmed Defence.

[H4] Scholar or Scribe

Most scholars are also Priests (see the Priest feat, page XX), attached to one or another temple. Certain clans may also employ scholars for their own purposes, and of course the Imperial administration employs vast numbers of scribes.

_Skills:_ Analysis and Planning (Int), Concentration (Con), Craft: Book Manufacturer (Int), Craft: Calligraphy (Dex), Decipher Script (Int), Instruction (Wis), Knowledge: Any (Int), Research (Int), and Speak Language (None).

_Combat Skills:_ Unarmed Attack and Unarmed Defence.

[H4] Winemaker

Though there are no taverns on Tékumel, the winemakers’ clan buildings always include rooms and halls to rent out for private parties, and so a professional winemaker will often serve as host as well as manufacturing the drinks.

_Skills:_ Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Craft: Cooper (Int), Craft: Vintner (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Knowledge: Business (Int), Knowledge: Domestic Arts (Int), Knowledge: Local (Int), Listen (Wis), Profession: Farmer (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spot (Wis).

[[[ End Sidebar ]]]

Skill Focus: At 1st level and every four levels thereafter, the Expert gains Skill Focus as a bonus feat.

Bonus Feat (Ex): At 2nd level and every four levels thereafter, the Expert gains a bonus feat chosen from the following list: Animal Affinity, Crafter, Deceitful, Deft Hands, Diligent, Dodge, Great Fortitude, Investigator, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes, Martial Weapon Proficiency, Scholar, Skill Focus, Wealthy

Skill Mastery (Ex): At 3rd level, the Expert becomes so certain in the use of some of her skills that she can use them reliably even under adverse conditions

Upon gaining this ability, she selects two skills. When making a skill check with one of these skills, she may take 10 even if stress and distractions would normally prevent her from doing so. Each time the Expert gains this special ability, she selects additional skills for it to apply to.

At 7th level, 11th level, and 15th level, the Expert may choose a further two skills in which to gain Skill Mastery.

Contacts (Ex): At 4th level and every four levels thereafter, the Expert gains the Contact class feature. The character has a named friend in a position of influence and/or power. The player should develop the friend’s background and personality in consultation with the GM. Friends will go out of their way to help the character, but have other obligations that can interfere with their availability. Furthermore, a character who abuses friendships may find that they become far less useful.

The friend’s actual level of influence should be consistent with the level of the campaign. For example, a rural magistrate is very well-placed to a low-clan person, but not to someone from the Clan of Sea Blue.

Each time the character gains the Contact class feature, he or she may either choose to have a further contact of Type 1 (see below), or improve the influence or disposition of an existing contact by +1 Type. A multiclassed character who gains the Contact class feature from two or more different classes may improve an existing contact or add a new one as usual.

Type 1 The friend is either a good contact (above the character’s rank in one of the professions) or a competent and close ally.

Type 2 The friend is either a very well-placed contact or a close friend with specifically (and frequently) useful Skills.

Type 3 The friend is extremely well placed or notably loyal and courageous, and will put the character’s welfare before the friend’s own. This Type could also represent a group of friends who are not as well placed or loyal but are still ready to help when needed. A Clan Elder or Lineage head could call on this Level of support from a clanhouse.

Type 4 The friend is very powerful for the campaign setting, or is a loyal and/or well-placed group.

Type 5 The friend is, or controls, a powerful organisation in the campaign setting.

Work of Renown (Ex): At 8th level, the Expert gains the ability to produce a Work of Renown. This is any crafted item, scholarly work, or other use of one of his or her skills that will propel the Expert’s name into that particular field as a known authority on the subject, superior craftsperson, or similar. A Work of Renown may be produced by taking at least two months and expending at least 500 Kaitars on materials, research, etc.

The GM and player should consult as to the precise effects of the Work of Renown on play, but bonuses of +3 to relevant skill rolls, +1 to attack rolls, +2 to damage rolls, or +2 to saving throws are all possibilities if the Work of Renown is a tool, weapon, armour, or other item of equipment. Alternatively, its benefits may be entirely social, being worth perhaps a Medium Favour owed by some influential figure (which might represent the gift of a physical item, or the gratitude of the character for work done, or similar) or even 1 point of Respect.

Advanced Skill Mastery (Ex): From 19th level onwards, the Expert may always Take 20 on any of the skills in which he or she has achieved Skill Mastery, without taking any extra time to do so and even in stressful or distracting conditions.

Masterpiece (Ex): A Masterpiece is similar in nature to a Work of Renown, but will establish the Expert as one of the pre-eminent authorities in the field, finest craftsperson in the Empire, or similar. A Masterpiece takes six months and 1,000 Kaitars to produce.

Again the precise effects should be devised with the GM’s assistance, but +6 to relevant skill rolls, +2 to attack rolls, +4 to damage rolls, +4 to saving throws, a Medium Favour owed by a highly influential figure, or 2 points of Respect, are all possibilities.

[H3] Guard

Guards are employed by both Temples and Clans. Much of their time is taken up with acting as a security force for the relevant temple complex or clan-house, but as with any group that is effectively a private army, a Guard detachment may occasionally be sent on another mission at the behest of its masters. Many Temple or Clan guards also act as police forces within their assigned area; an example would be the Tomb Police in the service of Lord Sárku, who protect the necropolis of Bey Su.

Some of the more warlike Temples and Clans even form their Guards into legions in time of war. Though Guards are not quite so effective as regular Legionaries in this role, many of a Guard’s skills are certainly transferable to soldiering.

[H4] Characteristics

Guards are expert at spotting, and rapidly dealing with, threats of any kind. This includes raiding parties sent out by rival Temples or Clans, invading enemy armies, and occasionally an opportunist thief or two. The more experienced Guards are also trained as personal bodyguards for high-ranking Temple or Clan personnel.

[H4] Other Classes

Temple guards, as might be expected, get on very well with priests of their own temple, including ritual priests (Entertainers), scholar priests (Sorcerers), and administrative priests (Experts). Indeed, all Temple guards also receive minimal priestly training, becoming Priests of the 1st Circle or sometimes higher.

[H4] Hit Dice and Ability Scores

The Guard uses d10 Hit Dice.

Wisdom and Constitution are of equal importance to the Guard. A Guard must be capable of detecting danger, then enduring it so as to defend his or her Temple or Clan to the last. Strength and Dexterity are also useful, as both these Ability Scores can enhance a variety of attacks against a foe.

[H4] Class Skills and Skill Points

The Guard’s class Skills (and the key Ability for each) are: Climb (Str), Craft (any) (Int), Gather Information (Cha), Heal (Wis), Hide (Dex), Instruction (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge: Culture (Int), Knowledge: Local (Int), Knowledge: Military (Int), Knowledge: Religion (Int), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Perform (any) (Cha), Search (Int), Sense Motive (Wis), Spot (Wis), Swim (Str), Teamwork (Wis), Melee Attack, Melee Defence, Ranged Attack, Ranged Defence, Unarmed Attack, and Unarmed Defence.

• Skill Points at 1st Level = (6 + Int Modifier) x 4

• Skill Points at Each Additional Level = 6 + Int modifier

Defensive Bonus (Ex): At 3rd level, the Guard gains a +1 Defensive Bonus. At 6th level and every three levels thereafter, this Defensive Bonus increases by +1. It is cumulative with any Defensive Bonus gained from levels in other classes. The Defensive Bonus applies to the Guard’s Defence Value.

Bonus Feat (Ex): At 2nd level and every three levels thereafter, the Guard gains a bonus feat, chosen from the following list: Promotion: Military, Toughness,

A Temple Guard _must_ select Priest as his or her bonus feat at 2nd level, if this feat has not already been selected.

Sudden Action (Ex): Once per day, a Guard of 7th level can focus his or her effort to burst into sudden action when the situation calls for it. The Guard can change his or her place in the initiative order, moving higher in the count by a equal to one-half his or her class level (rounded down). The Guard can declare the use of this ability at the start of any round, before anyone else takes an action.

Harm’s Way (Ex): Once per round, if a 13th level Guard is adjacent to an ally who is targeted by a direct melee or ranged attack (but not an area effect), the Guard can subject him or herself to the attack in the ally’s stead. If the attack hits the Guard, he or her takes damage normally. If it misses, it also misses the ally.

The Guard must declare his or her intention to place him or herself in harm’s way before the attack roll is made. The Guard selects his or her ally either prior to combat or immediately after the Guard makes his or her initiative check. The Guard can’t change his or her ally for the duration of the combat.

Counterattack (Ex): From 19th level, the Guard is able to block or evade most enemy attacks and immediately launch a devastating counterattack. Up to (3 + Dexterity bonus) times per day, immediately after an enemy has just attempted to make an attack against the Guard but has missed, the Guard may immediately make an attack against the enemy as a free action.

[H4] Notes

[H3] Labourer

Labourers are probably the most common character class in all of Tsolyánu. The class can include peasants, miners, builders, and any other profession that relies on physical strength more than skill. Many slaves are Labourers, though slaves can also be members of most of the other character classes.

[H4] Characteristics

Labourers work, usually with their hands.

[H4] Other Classes

[H4] Hit Dice and Ability Scores

The Labourer uses d10 Hit Dice.

Strength and Constitution are typically the main requirements of any Labourer who wishes to survive the dangerous, hot work of a typical Tsolyáni setting.

[H4] Class Skills and Skill Points

The Labourer’s class Skills (and the key Ability for each) are: Climb (Str), Craft (any) (Int), Gather Information (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge: Local (Int), Perform (any) (Cha), Profession (any) (Wis), Swim (Str), Teamwork (Wis), Unarmed Attack, and Unarmed Defence.

• Skill Points at 1st Level = (6 + Int Modifier) x 4

• Skill Points at Each Additional Level = 6 + Int modifier

Bonus Feat (Ex): At 2nd level, and every three levels thereafter, the labourer gains a bonus feat selected from the following list: Toughness,

Skill Mastery (Ex): At 3rd level, the Labourer becomes so certain in the use of some of her skills that she can use them reliably even under adverse conditions

Upon gaining this ability, she selects two skills. When making a skill check with one of these skills, she may take 10 even if stress and distractions would normally prevent her from doing so. At 3rd level and every six levels thereafter, each time the Labourer gains this special ability, she selects additional skills for it to apply to.

Skill Focus (Ex): At 6th level and every six levels thereafter, the Labourer gains Skill Focus as a bonus feat.

Survivor (Ex): At 7th level, a labourer has been through so much — the harsh regime of a palanquin slave, the unforgiving work of a construction labourer, perhaps a spell down the mines — that he or she is very difficult to stop by any means. An 7th level labourer may reroll any failed saving throw, except if the saving throw was failed with a natural roll of 1 on the d20, up to once per day, at the same DC.

At 13th level, the labourer may reroll any failed saving throw up to twice per day, and at 19th level up to three times per day. He or she may not reroll the same failed save more than once.

Powerful Magicians with two levels of the Magical Ability Attribute, at least four total levels of Magical Skills (Ritual Magic, Psychic Magic, Energy Management), and a Pedhétl of at least 7 have an aura of power that extends beyond themselves.

Spells cast into, through, or out of this sphere of protection have to overcome this aura. This aura extends out for one metre per Rank of the magician’s Magic: Ritual and Magic: Psychic Skills.

Any Spells cast in, through, or out of a magician’s aura must overcome that magician’s Magical Resistance — the magician may elect to make him or herself the target of the Spell. If he or she does so, the character may attempt to resist the Spell with a Magic Resistance check as normal (see page xxx). If the character fails, the Spell affects the character, not it’s intended target.

[H2] Sample Characters of Tékumel

These are examples of Tsolyáni characters, although the GM can also use them as NPCs.

[INSERT SAMPLE CHARACTERS]

[H3]

[H1] Chapter 3: Non-Human Player Characters

Humans are not the only creatures that flourish on Tékumel. Various alien species can also be played as characters, being either allied to the humans of Tsolyáni society, or even, occasionally, accepted into it as full residents and members of Clans. This chapter includes rules for playing those non-human characters.

It's always worth checking with the GM as to the appropriateness of non-human characters for his or her particular campaign – he or she may wish to limit the type and/or number of non-humans, sometimes banning them altogether. The N’lüss, it should be noted, are not strictly alien, but are a human sub-species; some GMs may permit players to be N’lüss, even if actual aliens are banned.

[H2] Tsolyánu Society and Aliens

Aliens are not exactly welcomed by an often conservative Tsolyáni society. They may be permitted to work, if humans have specific need of them, but even after years of service, will usually still find themselves treated as outsiders (if, sometimes, respected ones). Most are happy with this, seeking only to earn a good sum in Tsolyánu and then retire to their home territories.

A few aliens, notably the Páchi Lei and Pé Chói, can sometimes be welcomed as full members of Tsolyáni society, so long as they are willing to "go native" in terms of both language and customs. Fewer still may even be accepted as members of a Clan, and full citizens, after years of good and loyal service. This is simulated by selecting the Clan Membership feat (see p. XX).

Only those aliens who commonly work within Tsolyánu are presented in this chapter. Details of the feared Ssú and Hlüss, alien species utterly inimical to humans, can be found in the Bestiary (see p. XX).

[H2] Ahoggyá

[GRAPHIC: AHOGGYA]

The Ahoggyá are human height or a little smaller, with strong, large (0.8 metre diameter) barrel-shaped bodies and eight powerful limbs. Their four legs and four arms are arranged in radial symmetry, extending from the body at equidistant intervals. Each hand has three fingers and a thumb. The have four face-like areas, each with two eyes, one face between each pair of arms. Only one of the faces has a mouth. Over the arms and faces is a dome-shaped armoured shell. Below the shell, their bodies are thickly furred with a tangle of bristles extending down to the knee. This fur seems to be responsible for the notorious smell that other races complain about.

Those Ahoggyá who spend a few years in Tsolyánu usually work as mercenary soldiers, arena fighters, or other violent professions. They rarely stay much longer than that, or make serious efforts to integrate with Tsolyáni society. Some observers think that the complex, eight-sexed process of Ahoggyá reproduction may be part of the reason they tend to return to their swampy homes, since it must be difficult to assemble a suitable mating group from the relatively small Ahoggyá populations scattered around Tsolyánu.

[H3] Stereotypes

As far as humans are concerned, Ahoggyá are smelly, noisy, rude, and crude, beyond even what one would expect from most sentient non-humans. The phrase "eating like an Ahoggyá," popular around Jakálla, is used to refer to a noisy, open-mouthed eater.

Their eating habits also include extreme omnivorousness, with Ahoggyá happily eating carrion, insects, and other foods disgusting to humans. Worse still, they have no compunction about eating sentient beings, and find human flesh delicious.

Ahoggyá are valued for their strength, bravery, reliability, and robustness. An Ahoggyá with a job to do will do it, or die trying, at least to the best of its understanding. Their typically subhuman intelligence, and poor language skills, mean that an Ahoggyá's employer must take especial care to make instructions clear.

[H3] The Reality

Ahoggyá once built starships, but despite this, most of the stereotypes are true enough. Modern Ahoggyá would not be capable of such a feat, and it must be presumed that their intelligence has degenerated since their arrival on Tékumel. That low intelligence, combined with the fact that humans are as little interested in truly understanding Ahoggyá culture and customs as Ahoggyá are theirs, leads to frequent misunderstanding and significant cultural gulfs between the two races. Ahoggyá seem irrational, obsessive, uncontrolled and impulsive, to humans. Furthermore, they really do love the taste of human flesh, and so are barred from entrance to the Tsolyáni necropolises.

[H3] Clan and Lineage

It is rare indeed that an á would desire to join a human clan, and rarer still that a clan would accept one as a member. Most clans would be insulted even at the suggestion, as an Ahoggyá member could seriously reduce their prestige.

[H3] Religion

Ahoggyá appear to hold no religious rituals other than large community dances, but even these may really be primitive courtship rites with no particular religious context. Their apparent lack of religion means that Tsolyáni law treats them as animals for most purposes, preventing them from gaining citizenship (but meaning they only need pay half as much tax as supposed sentient creatures).

[H3] Effective Character Level

Based on the Ahoggyá’s Racial Traits, an Ahoggyá has an Effective Character Level of +1. In terms of game balance, a 1st level Ahoggyá is equivalent to a 2nd level human. This means that the GM should only allow a 1st level Ahoggyá to play in a campaign if he or she would allow a human character to start out at 2nd level in the same campaign.

[Ability Scores +0 CP, Armour +4 CP (5, -1 for Partial), Extra Arms +2 CP, Extra Attacks +11 CP (16, -3 due to the associated attack penalty, -2 due to restriction on attacking same person), Extra Defence +3 CP, Heightened Senses +1 CP = 2 + 5 + 2 + 11 + 3 +1 = 21 CP, Low Pedhétl 2 BP, Clanless 2 BP, Social Disadvantage 4 BP, Poor Verbal Skills 1 BP, Total 21 - 9 = 12 CP, ECL 1)

[H3] Racial Traits

Ahoggyá characters have the following racial traits.

Strength: Ahoggyá are very strong, gaining a +2 racial bonus to Strength.

Dexterity: Ahoggyá are clumsy, with a -2 racial penalty to Dexterity.

Constitution: Ahoggyá are extremely tough physically, and gain a +4 racial bonus to Constitution.

Intelligence: Ahoggyá are not very smart, and have a -2 racial penalty to Intelligence.

Wisdom: Ahoggyá are extremely strong-willed, and seem to feel no fear. Their eight eyes ensure they are also more perceptive and generally aware of their surroundings than the average human. All Ahoggyá have a +2 racial bonus to Wisdom.

Charisma: Although Ahoggyá must find one another attractive and worthy of respect in some way, other races perceive them as ugly, boorish, and lacking in social skills. They have a -4 racial penalty to Charisma.

Natural Armour: The Ahoggyá’s central barrel is naturally armoured, granting it Armour 5. This counts as partial armour, as the Ahoggyá’s arms are unarmoured. Thus the armour may be bypassed by making a Called Shot as though targeting Medium Armour, and so at a -6 penalty (see page XX).

Extra Limbs: Ahoggyá have four arms. This allows them to wield two two-handed weapons, four one-handed weapons, two one-handed weapons and two shields, or a similar combination. An Ahoggyá wielding several weapons at once may make additional attacks, one for each weapon beyond the first, at a -6 penalty on the attack with its primary hand and a -10 penalty on the attack with its secondary hands (with all the penalties reduced by 2 if the secondary weapons are Light).

For example, an Ahoggyá who usually has an attack bonus of +6 when wielding a sword may wield four swords, making one attack at +0 and the other three attacks at -4. Alternatively it may wield a sword and three daggers, making one attack at +2 and the other three attacks at -2.

The Multiweapon Fighting feat (see page XX) reduces the base penalty for making multiple attacks to -4 with all the attacks. If the four-sword Ahoggya in the above example had the Multiweapon Fighting feat, it would make its four attacks at +2 each. Using a sword and three daggers, it would make its four attacks at +4 each.

No more than two of an Ahoggyá’s arms may attack any one opponent at a time, since its limbs are spaced evenly around its body. In addition to their extra attacks, Ahoggyá may make a second Defence check without any penalty.

Expanded Field of Vision: Ahoggyá have a 360-degree field of vision, making it impossible to sneak up on one while it is awake unless one is concealing oneself or using magic. The Ahoggyá gains a +4 bonus to all Spot checks as a result.

Low Pedhétl: An Ahoggyá has a base Pedhétl of 2, though this can be increased by the Increased Pedhétl feat as usual.

Clanless: An Ahoggyá can never be accepted into a human clan, for any reason. They may not select the Clan Membership feat.

Second-Class Citizen (Non-Human): Ahoggyá, as non-humans, can never be full participants in Tsolyáni life. An Ahoggyá’s relative status, reflected by the Lineage and Wealth Attributes, does not go far in human society.

Poor Enunciation: All Ahoggyá suffer a -2 penalty on Charisma-based skill checks that involve speech, for example the use of Bluff to convince a guard to let the party through a gate. Nonverbal Charisma-based skill checks, such as the use of Bluff to feint in combat, are unaffected.

[H3] Character Classes

Most Ahoggyá who work in Tsolyánu join legions made up solely of Ahoggyá, or work in other combat- and muscle-oriented professions, with their most common character classes being Guard and Legionary. A small number become Administrative Priests (Experts) or Ritual Priests (Entertainers) as part of human priesthoods. An even smaller number become Sorcerers, though not usually very good ones. The temples of Sárku and Durritlámish will not allow them to join as Priests due to the Ahoggyá taste for human flesh, though may worship those gods.

[H3] Languages

Ahoggyá know their own language and one human language, usually Tsolyáni.

[H3] Naming

Ahoggyá do have their own names, but humans can neither understand nor pronounce them, so tend to give them nicknames. Ahoggyá do not seem to resent this. A list of typical Ahoggyá nicknames is given below.

[H2] Hláka

[GRAPHIC: HLAKA]

The Hláka are slimmer and a little shorter than humans, but their two leathery wings have a span of around 10 meters when unfolded. Other than the wings and their blade-tipped prehensile tails, they are humanoid in form, with two legs and two arms as well as their wings. Their bodies and limbs are furred in gray or brown, with the fur extending over the sides and back of their flat-topped round heads too. They have three eyes, usually blue, close-set under thickly ridged brows. Their mouths are muzzled and sharp-toothed.

Hláka prefer to fly rather than walk, finding walking very tiring. They need an enormous amount of food for their slight frames, each eating as much as a large and greedy human. Ideally they prefer to eat throughout the day.

Hláka are strictly monogamous, and once they have mated tend to concentrate on child-rearing. Many who come to Tsolyánu do so only to raise funds, returning home to raise child families once they have earned enough.

[H3] Stereotypes

Hláka are often seen as less intelligent than humans, or even as barely more smart than a clever animal. They make good scouts, given their ability to move fast and see great distances on the wing, but are too cowardly to be truly steady in that role. They can be easily distracted, but seem friendly enough. Their amiable nature means they will not long survive enslavement, soon pining away if kept in chains.

[H3] The Reality

Hláka are just as intelligent as humans, though the "wild" Hláka tend to have poor knowledge of human language and customs, sometimes giving ignorant humans the wrong impression. Most Hláka, wild or "civilized", are basically uninterested in human culture, wars, and concerns, but have their own concerns and interests. Seeing life from the air gives different perspectives, literally and metaphorically. Hláka who serve in Tsolyáni armies are more likely to acquire strong human language skills, as well as beginning to understand the human perspective on life.

Hláka are physically quite fragile, with a flier's typical hollow bones. This is why they prefer not to get into close combat or risk return fire, though they are quite willing to hurl or drop missiles of all kinds from above.

[H3] Clan and Lineage

Most Hláka never get accepted into human clans, since they are largely uninterested in such things and rarely stay in human society long enough. There are no particular barriers to their entry, though, other than the same social barriers that make it tough for most non-humans to become clan members. Several Hláka have joined clans, in the past.

[H3] Religion

Hláka religion seems very primitive to most humans, apparently consisting of carrying rocks up mountains. In fact, this is done according to a complex astronomical calendar, with different colors of rock having different significance. A few Hláka join human religions, but rarely take such things seriously enough for the liking of most priests.

[H3] Effective Character Level

Based on the Hláka’s Racial Traits, a Hláka has an Effective Character Level of +0. In terms of game balance, a 1st level Hláka is equivalent to a 1st level human.

[Ability Scores -3 CP, Heightened Senses +1 CP, Flight Rank 2 +4 CP (6 CP, Restriction: Only fly at 50 kph 2 BP), Extra Attacks +5 CP (8, -3 due to the associated attack penalty), Natural Weapon +1 CP = -3 + 1 + 4 + 5 + 1 = 8 CP, Social Disadvantages 4 BP, Distractible 1 BP, Awkward Size 1 BP, Restricted Ground Movement 1 BP, Total 8 - 7 = 1 CP, ECL 0)

[H3] Racial Traits

All Hláka have the following racial traits.

Strength: Hláka are not very strong, and have a -2 racial penalty to Strength

Constitution: Hláka are somewhat spindly and fragile, with weak, hollow bones. They have a -2 racial penalty to Constitution.

Dexterity: Hláka are dextrous and agile, with a +2 racial bonus to Dexterity.

Willpower: Hláka are not strong-willed, taking a -2 racial penalty to Wisdom.

Charisma: Hláka are overly chatty and easily distracted, two factors which reinforce most humans’ automatic prejudice against nonhumans. They have a -2 penalty to Charisma.

Excellent eyesight: Hláka have excellent vision, particularly distance vision. Their wide-set eyes give them a wider field of vision than humans too. They gain a +4 racial bonus to Spot checks.

Flight: Hláka fly extremely well, with a cruising speed of about 20 kph. Flying 100 km a day is no great problem for them, and they could push it to 200 km a day, though would find this very fatiguing. With a strong tailwind, a Hláka could reach a maximum speed of 50 kph, for perhaps 30 seconds at a time. They are very quiet when flying (+2 on Stealth rolls).

Bladed Tail: Hláka have a powerful prehensile tail, terminating in a bony, rapier-like blade. A Hláka can make an additional attack each round with its tail, at a -5 penalty (this penalty is reduced to -2 if the Hláka has the Multiattack feat). The tail deals 1d8 damage, with the Hláka’s Strength bonus applying as usual. Hláka often apply poison to their tails. A Hláka’s Unarmed Attack skill will add to tail attacks as usual.

Distractible: Hláka rarely focus as much on tasks as humans would like. They have a -4 racial penalty on all Concentration and Research checks.

Second-Class Citizen (Non-Human): Hláka, like other non-humans, will never be treated as full citizens in Tsolyáni society. Even one who joined a clan would not be treated so well as human clan members.

Awkward Size: Hláka wings are large, even when folded. This must be taken into account if they ever attempt to fit through narrow spaces.

Restricted Ground Movement: A Hláka can walk for at most 2 hours at a time, due to weak, easily tired leg muscles.

[H3] Character Classes

Most Hláka are Scouts, serving in either Hláka-only legions or with a small number of other Hláka as part of a normal legion. A few are Sorcerers, and career legionaries may be Soldiers, though other Hláka careers are rare.in Tsolyánu.

[H3] Languages

Hláka speak Hláka and one human language, usually Tsolyáni. Their own language seems to humans to consist of nothing more than squeaks, hoots, and whistles.

[ BOXED TEXT ]

[H3] Ground Attacks

Hláka are rarely brave when it comes to physical combat, being well aware of their own fragility. Even primitive Hláka will fight from the air, though, bombarding their foes with pebbles to harass them into leaving, or dropping larger rocks if the warning is ignored. Hláka serving in legions often refine these tactics, and add new ones of their own.

[H4] Stand-Off Attack

This attack is based on old Hláka hunting and defense techniques. They swoop in at an altitude of almost 200m, so as to minimize the risk of return and ensure their own missiles are moving at terminal velocity on impact, fast enough to break skulls or smash through armor. They release the missiles 40m to 50m from their targets, then bank off to the side, never overflying their victims directly. The attack is inaccurate (-4 penalty on the attack roll), making it more useful to attack armies groups than individuals. A dropped rock deals 2d10 damage. If it misses, but strikes a hard surface, anyone within 5' will be dealt 1d6 damage from flying fragments.

[H4] Low-Level Attack

When attacking smaller groups or individuals, Hláka attempt to attack from behind, diving close and low then hurling javelins from around 10m altitude. During such an attack run, the Hláka could potentially throw more than one javelin, continuing the pass for up to 3 rounds, so long as each javelin has a different target. After each pass, it takes them d6+4 rounds to regain enough height to make another pass.

[H2] Páchi Léi

[GRAPHIC: PACHI LEI]

Páchi Léi are about as tall as humans, but with pear-shaped, soft greenish-gray bodies, four arms, and four legs. Their bodies are coated with buds, and their pointy heads with spikes. They have eight limbs: four arms and four legs. Their muzzles are filled with teeth, and their large, round eyes have excellent night-vision. They have a limited precognitive psychic power, allowing them a chance of sensing danger within around 3m.

Each of the buds on a Páchi Léi contains an egg, which can be fertilized by spore-like spermatozoa from other Páchi Léi, when the latter are in the fertile phases of their four-year mating cycle. A fertilised egg-bud grows into a larger pod. Eventually (after a 250-day incubation) an infant bursts out of the pod. Páchi Léi do not truly have families, but tend to live in small social groups of around two to eight.

Unlike most of the other non-human races, Páchi Léi frequently settle in Tsolyánu indefinitely, and can even progress to high rank. They are currently being invaded by the Mu’ugalavyáni, which may motivate many Páchi Léi to emigrate to Tsolyánu in the first place.

[H3] Stereotypes

Páchi Léi are often seen as cowards, because the prefer to negotiate – or, failing that, to run or hide – rather than harm others. They are socialized and civilized, and fit in well with Tsolyáni society.

[H3] The Reality

Páchi Léi are not truly cowardly. Most would rather find non-violent solutions, and regard violence as essentially uncivilized and anti-social. There are fewer dedicated warriors among the Páchi Léi than among most races, but they certainly do exist, serving as soldiers and even officers in the legions. Even the most mild-mannered Páchi Léi, with enough provocation, can enter a "biyúrh" berserk state.

Their motivations remain mysterious, given their lack of a sex drive or sexual desire, and their lack of a family.

[H3] Clan and Lineage

Páchi Léi are sometimes allowed into human clans, though not usually high-ranking clans. The descendants of a Páchi Léi accepted into a clan are considered to be full clan members too.

[H3] Religion

Páchi Léi have their own dualistic religion, revering N’rg, god of wisdom and stability, and Á’lsh, god of change and sorcery. Páchi Léi who settle in Tsolyánu tend to go native, choosing a human god to worship instead.

[H3] Effective Character Level

Based on the Páchi Léi’s Racial Traits, a Páchi Léi has an Effective Character Level of +2. In terms of game balance, a 1st level Páchi Léi is equivalent to a 3rd level human. This means that the GM should only allow a 1st level Páchi Léi to play in a campaign if he or she would allow a human character to start out at 3rd level in the same campaign.

[Ability Scores +0 CP, High Pedhétl +1 CP, Extra Arms +2 CP, Extra Attacks +13 CP (16, -3 due to the associated attack penalty), Extra Defence +3 CP, Heightened Senses +2 CP, Sixth Sense +1 CP = 1 + 2 + 13 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 22 CP, Social Disadvantage 2 BP, Total 22 - 2 = 20 CP, ECL 2)

[H3] Racial Traits

Páchi Léi characters have the following racial traits.

High Pedhétl: Páchi Léi start a base Pedhétl of 5.

Extra Limbs: Páchi Léi have four arms. This allows them to wield two two-handed weapons, four one-handed weapons, two one-handed weapons and two shields, or a similar combination. They frequently fight with a combination of weapons and shields in their four hands. A Páchi Léi wielding several weapons at once may make additional attacks, one for each weapon beyond the first, at a -6 penalty on the attack with its primary hand and a -10 penalty on the attack with its secondary hands (with all the penalties reduced by 2 if the secondary weapons are Light).

For example, a Páchi Léi who usually has an attack bonus of +6 when wielding a sword may wield four swords, making one attack at +0 and the other three attacks at -4. Alternatively it may wield a sword and three daggers, making one attack at +2 and the other three attacks at -2.

The Multiweapon Fighting feat (see page XX) reduces the base penalty for making multiple attacks to -4 with all the attacks. If the four-sword Páchi Léi in the above example had the Multiweapon Fighting feat, it would make its four attacks at +2 each. Using a sword and three daggers, it would make its four attacks at +4 each.

In addition to their extra attacks, Páchi Léi may make a second Defence check without any penalty.

Expanded Field of Vision: Relative to humans, Páchi Léi have a far wider field of vision, and gain a +4 racial bonus to Spot checks.

Darkvision: Páchi Léi can see in the dark. Darkvision works exactly like normal sight, and Páchi Léi can function just fine with no light at all.

Sixth Sense: Páchi Léi can perceive ambushes, secret doors, and physical dangers within a three-metre range about half the time. The GM makes a Wisdom check for the Pachi Lei in secret, with a DC of 10. If the check succeeds, the GM will inform the Páchi Léi that it perceives “something” with its Sixth Sense, but not what or which direction. A Páchi Léi who has perceived a potential attack this way cannot be surprised by the attackers.

Second-Class Citizen: Though Páchi Léi are generally tolerated better than most non-humans, they can still never progress far in human society, unless they join a clan. Any Páchi Léi who is a full member of a human clan ignores this penalty.

[H3] Character Classes

Páchi Léi may participate in any Character Classes in Tsolyánu without restriction, though they will generally not rise to the highest levels outside the military (where they are mostly segregated into Páchi Léi legions).

[H3] Languages

Páchi Léi speak Páchi Léi and one human language, usually Tsolyáni.

[H2] Pé Chói

[ILLUSTRATION PÉ CHÓI]

Pé Chói are tall, thin, insect-like creatures, with a full height of 1.65 to 2.2 meters for an adult male. They have chitinous exoskeletons, jet-black in males and chalk-white in females, with gray areas around the eyes and ears. Pé Chói of both sexes sometimes change to a neuter stage; when males do this, they shrink a little, and become paler in color, though formerly female neuters remain superficially identical. Pé Chói are six-limbed, with a pair of powerful rear legs and two pairs of more hand-like forelimbs. They also have prehensile tails. Their heads are elongated, like their bodies, with big green eyes and fan-like ears.

Pé Chói have very sharp senses, including a psychic sense with which they tell if another Pé Chói has been killed recently (in the past 24 hours) in the immediate area (5 kilometers), as well as sensing the presence of other creatures within a few meters. They dislike being immersed in water, as they breath through abdominal spiracles and so can easily drown.

Pé Chói have been living among humans for many thousands of years, and many are fully integrated into human society.

[H3] Stereotypes

Pé Chói are well-liked by humans, who think of them as clever, subtle, and controlled. Their sophisticated attitude can come across as cold and over-intellectual, though, and some humans who prefer direct action get annoyed with the Pé Chói tendency to avoid physical pursuits. They are not considered to be ambitious politically, though they can make good negotiators, thanks to strong social skills. Pé Chói who have joined human society are seen as very human-like.

[H3] The Reality

Since Pé Chói are so well-known to humans, the above stereotypes are reasonably accurate. However, some Pé Chói are certainly physically active, and even coldly violent if serving in a legion. Likewise, a rare few are politically ambitious, with some rising to very high levels in human society, occasionally even befriending the highest nobles of the land.

Though Pé Chói do fit in to human society well, there are still truly alien aspects to their psychology, such as their concept of "Ntk-dqékt." This incorporates aspects of paradoxical detachment-and-union, existential nausea, stoicism, bereavement, pain, and other far less comprehensible concepts, and is believed to be a major part of every Pé Chói's life. Some scholars believe the Pé Chói psychic sense is partly to blame, allowing members of this race to sense each other yet only faintly. If it is the last vestige of something that was once a far more powerful interconnectivity, this could account for their sense of loss.

[H3] Clan and Lineage

Pé Chói can be, and often are, fully accepted into clans, even very high-ranking ones.

[H3] Religion

Originally the Pé Chói worshipped only the Father of Nests, who is closely related to the Gods of Stability. In the last 1300 years, encouraged by a human Tsolyáni Emperor, another god has been worshiped too, the Black Old One, encompassing the Gods of Change. In human society, many Pé Chói adopt human gods, usually Hnálla or Hrü’ü, occasionally Thúmis or Ksárul, or perhaps Karakán and Vimúhla for Pé Chói in the legions.

[H3] Effective Character Level

Based on the Pé Chói’s Racial Traits, a Pé Chói has an Effective Character Level of +2. In terms of game balance, a 1st level Pé Chói is equivalent to a 3rd level human. This means that the GM should only allow a 1st level Pé Chói to play in a campaign if he or she would allow a human character to start out at 3rd level in the same campaign.

[Ability Scores +1 CP, High Pedhétl +2 CP, Armour +2 CP, Extra Arms +2 CP, Extra Attacks +13 CP (16, -3 due to the associated attack penalty), Extra Defence +3 CP, Heightened Senses +2 CP, Telepathy +1 CP = 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 13 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 26 CP, Social Disadvantage 2 BP, Environmental 1 BP, Slow Healing 2 BP, Water Phobia 1 BP, Total 26 - 6 = 20 CP, ECL 2)

[H3] Racial Traits

Pé Chói characters have the following racial traits.

Dexterity: Pé Chói are more dextrous than humans. All Pé Chói have a +2 racial bonus to Dexterity.

High Pedhétl: Pé Chói start with a base Pedhétl of 6.

Natural Armour: A Pé Chói’s chitinous exoskeleton is equivalent to Armour 2.

Extra Limbs: Pé Chói have four arms. This allows them to wield two two-handed weapons, four one-handed weapons, two one-handed weapons and two shields, or a similar combination. A Pé Chói wielding several weapons at once may make additional attacks, one for each weapon beyond the first, at a -6 penalty on the attack with its primary hand and a -10 penalty on the attack with its secondary hands (with all the penalties reduced by 2 if the secondary weapons are Light).

For example, a Pé Chói who usually has an attack bonus of +6 when wielding a sword may wield four swords, making one attack at +0 and the other three attacks at -4. Alternatively it may wield a sword and three daggers, making one attack at +2 and the other three attacks at -2.

The Multiweapon Fighting feat (see page XX) reduces the base penalty for making multiple attacks to -4 with all the attacks. If the four-sword Pé Chói in the above example had the Multiweapon Fighting feat, it would make its four attacks at +2 each. Using a sword and three daggers, it would make its four attacks at +4 each.

In addition to their extra attacks, Pé Chói may make a second Defence check without any penalty.

Good Eyesight: Pé Chói receive a +4 bonus to Stat all Spot checks.

Good Hearing: Pé Chói receive a +4 bonus to all Listen checks.

Telepathy: Pé Chói can psychically sense the presence (but not thoughts) of creatures within a 2-meter radius. It also allows them to sense when another Pé Chói (only) is killed within a five-kilometer radius, or if one has been killed within the past 24 hours.

Second-Class Citizen: Pé Chói are nonhumans and so can never fully participate in Tsolyáni life. A Pé Chói’s relative status (Lineage and Wealth, in game terms) does not go far in human society. They are far more tolerated than are most nonhumans, nevertheless.

Environmental Limitation: Pé Chói breathe both their mouths and through spiracles on their abdomen and tail. They can consciously control the spiracles, closing them temporarily, but it is hard to maintain this (requiring Concentration checks, DC 10, with a cumulative penalty of -2 per round), as they have an instinctive response to stress that involves opening the spiracles as wide as possible for maximum oxygen. They are unable to learn to swim (though a Pé Chói could potentially float for as long as it could hold its breath), and even shallow water can drown them.

Slow Healing: Pé Chói heal at half the normal rate (rounded down), as it takes longer for their exoskeleton to heal than flesh.

If a Pé Chói is reduced to less than 50% of its starting hit points, it will not heal naturally. Only magic, or a character with the Heal skill and the special materials required to clean and patch the exoskeleton (only found in a Pé Chói healing kit), can repair such an injury.

Water Phobia: As a result of the Environmental Limitation mentioned earlier, Pé Chói tend to be phobic of water. Inevitably this phobia further enhances the panic that causes the spiracles to open. A Pé Chói in water must make a Will saving throw (DC 15) on the first round, or immediately open its spiracles as panic sets in. Furthermore, the character will be extremely reluctant to enter water (Will saving throw, DC 15, to even enter water voluntarily in the first place). Note that this phobia can be overcome by the Water Tolerance feat (see p. XX).

[H3] Character Classes

Pé Chói have no Character Class restrictions, and are welcome (at least, as welcome as non-humans ever are) in all aspects of human society. Pé Chói Legionaries and Scouts rarely join legions, though, except for specific Pé Chói Auxiliary legions.

[H3] Languages

There are several variant Pé Chói languages, or at least dialects. A Pé Chói will know one of these, and Tsolyáni (or, if preferred, a different human language). Humans often think that Pé Chói have odd accents – either flat and emotionless, or sinister and hissing – but Pé Chói have no difficulty communicating in Tsolyáni.

[H3] Naming

The following are examples of Pé Chói names.

[BEGIN CHART]

[END CHART]

[H2] Shén

[GRAPHIC: SHEN]

The Shén originally hail from the Antares system, and are scaly, black, and reptile-like. An adult Shén is the height of a tall human (2 meters), and has large, strong legs, clawed hands, and a club-tipped tail. They have long, pointed snouts, and many sharp teeth. A ridge-like crest of shiny spines tops their heads, standing upright at moments of heightened emotion.

There are three distinct Shén sexes: egg-creators, egg-layers, and egg-fertilizers. The first two are the closest analogues to males and females in humans. Egg-layers and egg-fertilisers are slightly less black than egg-creators, with dark gray scales particularly on their abdomens and upper faces. Shén of all sexes tend to become paler and grayer with age. Some Shén, perhaps inspired by human fashions, paint their scales.

Shén do not like to stay in Tsolyánu for too many years, not getting on well with the northern climate, particularly during its cold winters (cold compared to their equatorial regions, which humans would find dangerously hot). Most thus do not integrate fully into human society, only rarely joining clans. Thanks to their strength and claws, they usually find it easy to get work in legions or as guards, though their large and rather clumsy hands mean they need to use specially made weapons.

[H3] Stereotypes

Shén are seen as strong, stupid goons, barely able to speak intelligibly, and fit for thuggery but not much else. They are believed to consume human flesh without compunction, and frequently fight amongst themselves. They have also been seen attacking Ahoggyá on sight and without provocation.

[H3] The Reality

Shén are far from stupid, being very close to human intelligence. Indeed, they are former starfarers, with an old, complex, and baroque culture (though it must be borne in mind that Shén in Tsolyánu have left that culture, at least temporarily). They have no particular taboo about cannibalism, and have always eaten their own children, strengthening the genetic pool by preying on the weak.

It is true that Shén tend to be quite aggressive, by human standards. This stereotype is exaggerated because most Shén seen in Tsolyánu are professional mercenaries or gladiators, and thus are aggressive even by Shén standards. When they attack each other, seemingly without reason, it is actually because Shén become instinctively angered in the presence of other Shén from rival "egg-groups". This is a pheromonal effect which it is hard for Shén to overcome. Their long-standing dislike of Ahoggyá can also lead to conflic.

[H3] Clan and Lineage

It is extremely rare for Shén to want to join, or indeed to be invited to join, a human clan.

[H3] Religion

The native Shén religion has two main gods, The One Of Eggs and The One Who Rends, roughly analogous to Stability and Change. Shén living in Tsolyánu often select a local deity that corresponds reasonably well with their general affiliation, and with their character class.

[H3] Effective Character Level

Based on the Shén Racial Traits, a Shén has an Effective Character Level of +1. In terms of game balance, a 1st level Shén is equivalent to a 2nd level human. This means that the GM should only allow a 1st level Shén to play in a campaign if he or she would allow a human character to start out at 2nd level in the same campaign.

[Ability Scores +1 CP, Armour +2 CP, Natural Weapons +4 CP, Extra Attacks +13 CP (16, -3 due to the associated attack penalty), Heat Tolerance +1 CP = 1 + 2 + 4 + 13 + 1 = 22 CP, Low Pedhétl 2 BP, Social Disadvantage 4 BP, Huge Hands 1 BP, Pheromones 2 BP, Impaired Charisma 1 BP, Total 21 - 10 = 11 CP, ECL 1)

[H3] Racial Traits

Strength: Shén are very strong, with a +4 racial bonus to Strength.

Constitution: Shén are extremely tough, and gain a +4 bonus to Constitution.

Dexterity: Shén are clumsy, and have a -4 racial penalty to Dexterity.

Intelligence: Shén are not quite as smart as humans, with a -2 racial penalty to Intelligence.

Willpower: Shén are strong-willed, and have a +2 racial bonus to Wisdom

Charisma: Shén are seen as thuggish, stupid cannibals with few positive qualities. They have a -2 racial penalty to Charisma.

Low Pedhétl: Shén have a base Pedhétl of 2.

Natural Armour: Shén have natural armor, from their tough hide and scales. This is counted as Armour 2.

Natural Weapons: Shén have claws (1d8 damage), a hard beak (1d6 damage), and a powerful tail, with a bony club on the end that may be used in combat (1d6 damage). A Shén may attack with all four weapons in a round, with no penalty for the claw attacks and a -5 penalty for the beak and tail attacks. The Multiattack feat reduces this penalty to -2.

A Shén which wields a manufactured weapon in one of its claws may attack with the weapon, as well as making attacks with its natural weapons as normal (no penalty for the second claw attack; -5 for the beak and tail attacks, or -2 with Multiattack). It may wield a weapon in one claw and a shield in the other, as well as using its beak and tail attacks at the usual penalties. A Shén wielding a two-handed weapon with both claws may also make beak and tail attacks at the usual penalties.

A Shén wielding two manufactured weapons, one in each hand, applies the usual penalties for two-weapon combat, as well as the usual reductions to those penalties for one or both weapons being light or for the Two-Weapon Fighting feat.

Heat Tolerant: Shén are resistant to heat, suffering no ill effects from it until it gets well beyond the temperatures in the human-occupied areas of Tékumel.

Second-Class Citizen (Nonhuman): Shén, as non-humans, can never be full participants in Tsolyáni life. A Shén’s relative status, reflected by its Lineage and Wealth, does not go far in human society.

Huge Hands: Shén hands are so large and clumsy that they cannot use most human weapons competently. They receive a -2 penalty to attack rolls when using weapons not manufactured to Shén scale.

Pheromones: Shén are segregated by “egg-group.” To any one Shén, some egg-groups are friendly to his or her own, most are neutral, and some are enemies to be attacked on sight. The Shén can scent others' egg-groups by the pheromones they give off, and will tend to attack those from enemy egg-groups, acting on instinct. He or she must make a successful Will save at DC 10 after five minutes spent in the enemy Shén’s presence. If the Shén succeeds at the Will save, it must make a further Will save for each additional five minutes spent near the enemy Shén, but with a cumulative -2 penalty to the save for every five minutes beyond the first. They react the same way to Ahoggyá as they do to Shén of an opposing egg-group, but the Will save DC is 15.

Impaired Charisma: Shén take a -2 penalty to all Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks when dealing with Ahoggyá or with Shén from rival egg groups.

[H3] Character Classes

Shén can become Imperial citizens, but they are unwelcome in both the Priesthood or the Government (the only exceptions being Shén who have the Clan Membership feat; see page XX). They are welcome in Legions or similarly military roles. Almost Legionary Shén are in Shén-specific Legions, though a few work in low-status irregular Legions. No Shén may ever attain a higher rank than Tirrikámu in a non-Shén Legion. So far, not even the most heroic Shén have ever been accepted into a Heavy Infantry or Elite Legion. The most common Shén Character Classes are Laborer, Legionary, and Guard.

[H3] Languages

All Shén know one of the Shén languages — there are several closely-related languages, used by different egg-groups — and one human language (usually Tsolyáni). Shén can never sound like human language native speakers because their vocal apparatus is shaped wrongly.

[H3] Resources

Shén may spend Resource Points on anything a human can, except to use them to bypass the glass ceilings in their chosen professions.

[H3] Naming

The following are examples of Shén names. They may reflect different dialects and naming conventions of different egg-groups.

[H2] Tinalíya

[GRAPHIC: TINALIYA]

The Tinalíya are just 55cm to 75cm tall. A Tinalíya has four short, outwardly bowed legs, a round abdomen, and a pair of long, claw-fingered arms. Their bodies have several small round segments, and are covered with a thick layer of horn in a dark brown, red-brown or tan shade. The have large eyes set into sloping, somewhat humanoid heads. Most Tinalíya are neuter, with only a small number of males and females. The males, in particular, are almost never found in the human world, and even the neuters and females rarely stay for more than a few years. Most prefer the intricate culture of their own underground cities.

[H3] Stereotypes

Tinalíya are seen as humorless, and lacking in imagination, particularly when it comes to comprehending metaphor and idiom. Conversely, they are considered to be good at making and repairing machines.

[H3] The Reality

The stereotypes are quite accurate. Tinalíya take everything literally and at face value. Humor and poetry are quite alien to them. Tinalíya love to learn practical, sensible things, though, and are quick to grasp new concepts, so long as those concepts are logical and material. They can be courageous combatants, despite their size, preferring to outsmart opponents but willing to tough it out in a head-to-head brawl if necessary. There are several Tinalíya-only legions, used by the Livyáni to fight against the Mu’ugalavyáni.

[H3] Clan and Lineage

Tinalíya never join human clans. They are already bound up in their own complex social structure.

[H3] Religion

The Tinalíya are as practical regarding religion as in any other matters. They might join human religions, so long as they have had the relevant god's power satisfactorily demonstrated to them. They do have their own religious beliefs, revolving around a disinterested creator-god.

[H3] Effective Character Level

Based on the Tinalíya Racial Traits, a Tinalíya has an Effective Character Level of +0. In terms of game balance, a 1st level Tinalíya is equivalent to a 1st level human.

[Ability Scores -2 CP, High Pedhétl +2 CP, Small Size +5 CP, Hardy +1 CP = -2 + 2 + 5 +1 = 6 CP, Social Disadvantage 3 BP, Literal-Minded 1 BP, Total 6 - 4 = 2 CP, ECL 0)

[H3] Racial Traits

Tinalíya characters have the following racial traits.

Strength: Tinalíya are weak, with a -4 racial penalty to Strength.

Constitution: Tinalíya are small and rather fragile, and have a -4 racial penalty to Constitution.

Dexterity: Tinalíya are quite dextrous, having a +2 racial bonus to Dexterity.

Intelligence: Tinalíya are a little smarter than humans, with a +2 racial bonus to Intelligence.

Willpower: Tinalíya are strong-willed, and have a +2 racial bonus to Wisdom.

Charisma: Tinalíya do not understand humor or fantasy, and so find it hard to understand or get on with other species. They have a -2 racial penalty to Charisma.

High Pedhétl: Tinalíya have a base Pedhétl of 6.

Small Size: Tinalíya are Small in size. This grants them a +1 bonus to all attack rolls, a +4 bonus on Hide checks, and a +1 bonus to Defence Value.

Hardy: Despite their rather fragile appearance and susceptibility to injury, Tinalíya are more resistant to disease, poison and many other hazards than their small size might suggest. They have a +2 racial bonus to all Fortitude saving throws and Constitution checks.

Second-Class Citizen (Nonhuman): Tinalíya are nonhumans, so can never be full participants in Tsolyáni life. A Tinalíya’s relative status, reflected by its Lineage and Wealth, does not go far in human society.

Literal-Minded. íya have great difficulty understanding or communicating almost any non-literal concepts, however good they might otherwise be with language. A Tinalíya has a -4 penalty on all Sense Motive checks relating to humans or any other race that uses humor and non-literal speech.

[H3] Character Classes

Tinalíya are usually best suited as Experts (usually scholars or bureaucrats) or Sorcerers, since their literal-mindedness can be something of a boon in those character classes. Despite their size, they do quite commonly become warriors, too (Legionaries or Scouts), and make a success of that work.

[H3] Languages

Tinalíya know the Tinalíya language and one human language (usually Tsolyáni). They have a strong accent, though this does not significantly interfere with communication.

[H3] Naming

The following are examples of Tinalíya names.

[H1] Chapter 4: Skills, Feats, and Flaws

Unless otherwise noted here, all the standard skills and feats from the _Player’s Handbook_ may be selected and used as normal.

[H2] Skills

Unless otherwise noted, all the usual skills can be learned, with the usual restrictions on cross-class skills.

[H3] Unsuitable Skills

The following skills are unsuitable for _Tékumel d20_ games:

Ride, Spellcraft.

[H3] New Skills

The following new skills are introduced.

[H4] Bribe (Charisma)

You know who to bribe to get what you want, how much to offer, and most importantly how and when to offer it so it will not be taken as an insult or embarrassment to the character being bribed.

Check: A Bribe check can be used to get a result you want from a character who does not much care either way but would prefer to baulk you so as to follow procedure (DC 15). It is considerably more difficult to Bribe someone who actively desires not to assist you (DC 25+). The GM should determine the amount of bribe required asking you to roll. On a failed check, you must attempt a Diplomacy check (same DC as the original Bribe check) to avoid causing offence. On a successful check, you may bribe the character with an amount suggested by the GM, or you may choose not to do so without loss of face.

Synergy: If you have five or more ranks of Bureaucracy, you gain a +2 bonus on all Bribe checks. If you have five or more ranks of Sense Motive, you gain a +2 bonus on all Bribe checks.

[H4] Bureaucracy (Intelligence)

Description: Paperwork features heavily in administration work and there is a lot of “red tape.” Regulations must be followed, goods and resources accounted for, and appropriate respect shown to higher-up bureaucrats. A character with this skill knows how to work the system — filing paperwork, calling in favours, and sweet-talking his or her superiors. In the event of an emergency where a character has not followed policy and protocol, this also helps cover his or her tracks and avoid any possible disciplinary action or dishonour.

Check: The DC is at the GM’s discretion, but the following guidelines apply:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Situation|DC|
|Doing a perfectly legitimate action more quickly.|15|
|Making a close call look perfectly legitimate.|20|
|Obtaining a Favour from a superior for something that is otherwise unavailable (note that this count as a Minor Favour owed as normal).|25|
|Covering for a colleague who has flagrantly violated procedure and been caught.|30|

Synergy: If you have five or more ranks of Bribe, you gain a +2 bonus on all Bureaucracy checks.

[H4] High Cartography (Intelligence)

High Cartography is the skill of creating and interpreting the carved gemstones used as detailed and compact maps by the ancients.

Check: A High Cartography check can be used to make a new piece of High Cartography (typical DC 25+, with at least four weeks of work and highly expensive raw materials) or to “read” another High Cartographer’s creation, potentially revealing a vast quantity of information about the terrain depicted (typical DCs 15 to 30 depending on the subtlety of the information encoded).

Synergy: If you have five or more ranks of Knowledge: Geography, you gain a +2 bonus on all High Cartography attempts. If you have five or more ranks of Navigate, you gain a +2 bonus on all High Cartography attempts. If you have five or more ranks of Craft: Jeweller, you gain a +2 bonus on all High Cartography checks made specifically to create a High Cartography artefact.

[H4] Instruction (Wisdom)

Instruction is the skill of teaching others. This includes both passing on skills (including the Instruction skill) and more specific training such as Teamwork-oriented manoeuvres (see p. XX).

The character with Instruction may teach any skill he or she has, up to a maximum number of ranks equal to either his or her ranks in Instruction or the skill, whichever is higher. Instruction provides no especial benefit if the student has the taught skill available as a class skill. The benefit comes if the student does not have the skill available as a class skill, in which case the instruction enables him or her to buy the skill using only 1 Skill Point/Rank, rather than the usual 2 Skill Points/Rank for cross-class skills.

Instruction takes one full week of work (five days) for both the instructor and the student, for each +1 rank taught. No other work may be carried out during this time period, so income cannot usually be drawn during instruction (unless it is payment for tuition by the student, of course). The maximum class size is 10 - desired rank in skill (minimum one), so that as soon as a character has +9 or more in the skill to be taught, he or she will need to be trained one-on-one.

At the end of the week of instruction, the instructor makes an Instruction check (DC = 5 + student’s desired Ranks in the taught skill), and the student makes an Intelligence check (DC 10, but with a +2 bonus if the instructor has five or more ranks in Instruction). If both these checks are successful, the skill has been taught, and the student may spend 1 Skill Point to increase the skill by +1. It is not possible to Take 10 on Instruction checks.

Note that Skill Points must always be expended when learning a new skill. However good an Instructor you are, you cannot teach someone who is not ready to learn.

_Example:_ Isúra is teaching Sánjesh how to hunt (Survival skill). Isúra has Instruction +8 and Survival +6. Sánjesh, as a Legionary, does not have Survival available as a class skill, and has no ranks in it. His Intelligence is 13 (for a +1 Intelligence modifier). At the end of the first week of training, Isúra makes an Instruction check (DC 5 + 1 = 6), and automatically succeeds (since her Instruction of +8 is enough to do this even with a roll of 1). Sánjesh must make an Intelligence check, and rolls an 11 + 1 (Intelligence modifier) +2 (because Isúra has five or more ranks of Instruction) = 14, gaining Survival +1 for a cost of 1 Skill Point rather than the usual 2 Skill Points. In the second week, Isúra attempts to train her pupil up to Survival +2. This still does not require an Instruction check, because the DC is so low (5 + 2 = 7), but this time Sánjesh only rolls a 6 on his Int check, +3 = 9, not quite enough! The second week is wasted: Sánjesh simply cannot grasp the concepts behind the Survival +2 skill. He may continue training for further weeks in hope of succeeding at the Intelligence check next time, or he can abandon the attempt and stick with Survival +2, or he can bite the bullet and spend a further 2 Skill Points to raise Survival from +1 to +2. Isúra can potentially teach Sánjesh up to Survival +6, but this will require a minimum of five more weeks of training even assuming he keeps making his Intelligence checks and she keeps making her Instruction checks.

[H4] Magic (Wisdom or Intelligence)

The Magic skills may only be learned by a character who has the Magician feat (see p. XX). There are two distinct Magic skills: Magic: Psychic (Wisdom-based) and Magic: Ritual (Intelligence-based). Magic skills are used when casting spells of the appropriate sort. Casting a spell requires a Magic check, with the DC being equal to the Spell Cost (see p. XX). Magic skills are also used to resist hostile magic. More information about all aspects of these skills can be found in the Magic chapter.

[H4] Navigate

The ability to navigate by the stars and sun, recognise landmarks or animal routes, and read maps, including specialised symbolic maps such as tubeway markings but not including High Cartography (see p. XX). The Navigate Skill will help a character find the fastest and safest route to a destination.

Synergy: If you have five or more ranks of Wilderness Tracking, you gain a +2 bonus on all Navigate attempts. If you have five or more ranks of High Cartography, you gain a +2 bonus on all Navigate attempts. If you have five or more ranks of Decipher Script, you gain a +2 bonus on all Navigate attempts that involve tubeway cars.

[H4] Teamwork (Wisdom)

Teamwork is a skill, but is not usually used for making Skill Checks in the ordinary sense. Rather, it provides a pool of Team Points to a team that works together, allowing them to achieve extraordinary results when they act as a unit. For full information about Teamwork, see p. XX.

[H4] Wilderness Tracking

The ability to successfully trail or track someone or something while outdoors in a rural or wilderness setting. In Tékumel d20, unlike other d20 games, the Wilderness Survival skill is split into two skills, Wilderness Tracking (for tracking, only) and Wilderness Survival (for everything else).

Synergy: If you have five or more ranks of Navigate, you gain a +2 bonus on all Wilderness Tracking attempts. If you have five or more ranks of Knowledge: Nature, you gain a +2 bonus on all Wilderness Tracking attempts specifically to track creatures of the animal or magical beast types.

[H2] Feats Overview

All the usual feats can be selected if desired, except as noted otherwise.

[H3] Unsuitable Feats

The following feats are not appropriate for _Tékumel d20_ games:

Combat Casting, Combat Reflexes, Diehard, Extra Turning, Greater Spell Focus, Greater Spell Penetration, Greater Weapon Focus, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Disarm, Improved Grapple, Improved Trip, Improved Unarmed Strike, Leadership, Manyshot, Mobility, Mounted Archery, Mounted Combat, Ride-By Attack, Shot on the Run, Spell Focus, Spell Mastery, Spell Penetration, Spirited Charge, Spring Attack, Trample, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus, and any Metamagic or Item Creation feats.

[H3] Altered Feats

The following feats are slightly altered or expanded in _Tékumel d20_.

#### [H4] Animal Affinity

You have a special affinity with animals of all kinds.

Benefit: You get a +2 bonus on all Handle Animal checks and Knowledge: Nature checks.

#### [H4] Greater Weapon Specialisation

#### Choose a weapon with which you have the Weapon Specialisation feat. You have mastered that particular weapon.

#### Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +12, Weapon Specialisation with weapon, Melee Attack 9 ranks _or_ Ranged Attack 9 ranks as appropriate.

#### Benefit: When wielding your chosen weapon, you gain a +4 bonus to damage rolls. This supersedes the bonus for Weapon Specialisation.

#### [H4] Magical Aptitude

#### You find magical spells particularly easy to perform.

#### Benefit: You get a +2 bonus on all Magic: Ritual and Magic: Psychic checks.

#### [H4] Martial Weapons Proficiency

#### You have spent time in one of the Legions or training with a weapons master, and have learned how to wield all the common military weapons with fair proficiency.

#### Prerequisite: Base Attack Bonus +1, Simple Weapons Proficiency.

#### Benefit: You are able to use all martial weapons without suffering a non-proficiency penalty.

#### [H4] Weapon Specialisation

#### Choose a weapon with which you are proficient. You are an expert with that particular weapon.

#### Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +4, Melee Attack 3 ranks _or_ Ranged Attack 3 ranks as appropriate.

#### Benefit: When wielding your chosen weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls.

#### [H4] Whirlwind Attack

#### Prerequisites: Dex 13, Int 13, Combat Expertise, Dodge, base attack bonus +4.

#### Benefit: When you use the full attack action, you can give up your regular attacks and instead make one melee attack at your full base attack bonus against each nearby opponent (any opponent that the GM considers you to be capable of attacking without having to take a move action to get to them).

#### When you use the Whirlwind Attack feat, you also forfeit any bonus or extra attacks granted by other feats, spells, or abilities.

[H3] New Feats

The following new feats may be selected by characters in _Tékumel d20_.

[H4] Accuracy

Your attacks are unusually accurate.

Prerequisites: Base Attack Bonus +2

Benefit: You suffer reduced dice penalties when attempting an accurate attack, such as striking at partial Armour, weak points, or vital spots, shooting at longer-than-usual ranges. Accuracy is also used when attempting a special trick shot, such as carving an initial on someone’s body or ricocheting an arrow off a wall to shoot a target around a corner. Each difficulty penalty is reduced by 2 (to a minimum of 0). For example, attacking a vital spot (-8 penalty) would become a -6 penalty, while firing at double range (-4 penalty) would receive -2 penalty.

Special: This feat is best suited to Heroic Fantasy campaigns. The GM may wish to restrict its use in less high-powered games.

#### [H4] Administrator

#### You are a born civil servant.

#### Benefit: You get a +2 bonus on all Bureaucracy and Bribery checks.

[H4] Attractive

In Tsolyánu, having an appropriate appearance can be at least as vital as beauty. That is, a character who looks right for their social status and societal niche can sometimes get further than one who is merely physically attractive. Your looks achieve both, a combination you have turned to your advantage on many occasions.

Prerequisite: Charisma 13, Human

Benefits: Select a feature that is particularly attractive. For example: soulful eyes, lustrous hair, a resonant voice, good taste in art, etc. This grants you a +2 bonus to Seduce checks, and lets you attract a number of admirers equal to 5 + your Charisma bonus, as long as you can explain to the GM how you are using your attractive trait (for example, your lustrous hair would need to be artfully arrayed, or if you had a resonant voice, you would need to speak or sing, etc.). These admirers will generally stay around for as long as you pay them attention, though this is not a magical effect, so urgent business elsewhere will usually end the effect.

In addition, you resemble an archetype that is easily recognised in Tsolyái society, such as a "Soft-Spoken Clan Woman", a "Cultured Noble", a "Dour Legionary", a "Religious Zealot" etc. You gain a +4 bonus to Charisma checks and Charisma-related skill checks, so long as you are very deliberately and powerfully acting according to your archetype. Note that having such a strong and well-known persona does mean that you must maintain consistency to it at all costs. You could lose a great deal of face if as Cultured Noble you ever showed a lack of taste, or if as Religious Zealot you tolerated disrespectful behaviour towards your god.

[H4] Biyúrh

You are capable of entering into a berserk state when wounded or severely agitated.

Prerequisite: Páchi Léi race.

Benefit: Any time you are dealt hit point damage by a melee attack, or are personally, directly threatened by at least two armed opponents, you may make a Wisdom check to release your anger into a berserk rage. The base Wisdom check DC is 15, but you gain a bonus on the check equal to the damage you have been dealt so far. If your check succeeds, you may enter a state of biyúrh for a number of rounds equal to 10 + your Constitution modifier, or until you can no longer see any enemies, whichever is first. When in a state of biyúrh, you gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls, but suffer a -2 penalty to Defence Value. Furthermore, while in a biyúrh state, you may not use spells or missile weapons, but must attack the nearest enemy or else move at maximum speed towards any living enemies if none are within range of your melee attacks. You may enter a biyúrh state up to once per day.

[H4] Battle Cry

You are mentally tough, and can channel this into physical resilience by shouting your favorite battle cry or prayer, allowing you to fight on when others would fail. When severely wounded, you work yourself up into a berserk frenzy rather than collapsing and calling weakly for the nearest healer.

Prerequisite: Iron Will.

Benefit: When reduced to zero or negative hit points, you may choose to act as if you were still on positive hit points, rather than disabled or dying. You must make this decision as soon as you are reduced to negative hit points (even if it isn’t your turn). If you do not choose to act as if you were disabled, you immediately fall unconscious.

When using this feat, you must make a full melee attack each round if there is a foe within melee range; if no foe is within range, you must charge the nearest foe. Each round that you act in this way, you sustain 1 point of damage. If you are reduced to -10 hit points by any means, you will die at the beginning of the next round on which you cannot see any enemies, though you may continue to fight until that point.

Normal: A character without this feat who is reduced to between –1 and –9 hit points is unconscious and dying; a character without this feat who is reduced to zero hit points is disabled.

Special: The player should devise an appropriate battle cry or a few words of prayer for the character, and call it to indicate the use of this feat. This invocation should be appropriate to the character’s culture, religion, etc.

[H4] Blessed

Your supernatural patron has especially blessed you.

Prerequisite: Cha 15, Lucky.

Benefit: While in the immediate area of influence of the patron (as defined by the Lucky feat) you may add or subtract a +1 bonus or a -1 penalty to any and all die rolls you make. You are also generally lucky and gain a +2 bonus to all Bluff and Sense Motive checks that relate specifically to gambling games.

#### [H4] Clan Membership

You are such an honoured Tsolyáni citizen that you have been permitted to join a Clan, despite your nonhuman nature.

Prerequisite: Charisma 13, Nonhuman.

Benefit: You and the GM should consult together and determine a suitable Clan for your character, based on your race, class, and any other pertinent factors.

Normal: Nonhumans may not join Clans.

Special: Ahoggyá may not select this feat. In the unlikely event that an Ahoggyá expressed a desire to join a human Clan, the Clan would rapidly quash any such desire.

[H4] Close Combat Expert

You have perfected close-combat fighting and groundwork.

Prerequisite: Combat Expertise, Dodge, Int 15, Dex 15

Benefit: You gain a +4 bonus on all grapple attacks or trip attempts.

[H4] Combat Flyer

You have practised flying in a military context, enabling you to make more effective aerial attacks and fly for longer during the course of the working day.

Prerequisite: Hláka race, Con 11, Dex 11

Benefit: You may fly 150 km per day comfortably, or 250 km per day if you really push yourself. Furthermore, you gain a +1 bonus on all ranged attacks made when you are flying.

Normal: Hláka can fly 100 km per day, or push themselves to fly 200 km per day.

[H4] Concealment

You have an unearthly ability to conceal weapons about your person.

Prerequisite: Sleight-of-hand 4 ranks.

Benefit: As long as you have something to hide the weapons (even if it only long hair or a light robe) your weapons will not be noticed by anything short of an actual physical search, and such a search is conducted at a -8 penalty to the Search check.

[H4] Crafter

You are good with your hands, capable of creating all manner of practical and ornamental items from whatever materials are available.

Prerequisites: Int 13.

Benefit: You gain a +3 bonus to all Craft checks.

[H4] Dedaratl

You have learned the basics of the unarmed martial arts secrets taught only to dedicated worshippers of Thúmis and Keténgku.

Prerequisite: Int 13, Unarmed Attack 1 rank, Unarmed Defence 1 rank, Priest, must be a worshipper of Thúmis or Keténgku.

Benefit: You may use your Intelligence modifier instead of your Strength modifier to determine damage when making an unarmed attack. This includes any grappling-related attacks, such as Locks and Throws. Likewise, you may make an Intelligence check (instead of a Strength or Dexterity check) if making an opposed Ability Score check when you or an opponent is attempting to Escape from a grapple; you may use your Intelligence instead of your Strength when determining whether one side or the other in a grapple is “much stronger” (see p. XX); and you may add your Intelligence modifier rather than your Strength modifier when Striking to Incapacitate with an unarmed attack (see p. XX).

[H4] Flunkies

You are accompanied by two servants, toadies, or hangers-on.

Prerequisite: Great Clan _or_ character level 4.

Benefit: Your two flunkies are NPC 1st level characters from the Expert, Entertainer, Merchant, or Laborer classes. They will serve appropriately according to their abilities, but most will only fight in self-defense. Nobles often have this feat, representing the presence of attendants from less well-favored lineages within their clan and lower-ranking client clans. It is also suitable for anyone with an important position in society. Your two flunkies advance in character level so as to remain one-half your own level, rounded down (minimum 1st level).

Special: You may select this feat up to three times. On selecting it for the second time, you gain +4 additional flunkies. On selecting it for a third time, you gain a further +8 flunkies.

[H4] Flyby Attack

Prerequisite: Fly speed.

Benefit: When flying, the creature can take a move action (including a dive) and another standard action at any point during the move. The creature cannot take a second move action during a round when it makes a flyby attack.

Normal: Without this feat, the creature takes a standard action either before or after its move.

[H4] Good Reputation

You have a good reputation.

Prerequisite: Cha 11, Wis 11.

Benefit: Tsolyánu society is quite static, with a strong set of shared values, and so a good reputation can go a long way. The player should choose what kind of “good reputation” her character has, based on the style of the campaign. In some campaigns, a reputation as a “Fair and Just Negotiator” might be more useful than one as a “Fearless Killer”; in others, quite the reverse. A character with a reputation must be prepared to demonstrate it and/or defend it, at any time, particularly if the reputation is especially combative. Failure to do so could result in the loss of the reputation. You are well-known throughout an entire city or province, even by people you have never met. The reputation might be a simple description: “steady” or “expert archer.” Anyone aware of the reputation (which will be most people around you) will react accordingly. Increase your Respect by +10 Points.

[H4] Great Clan

You come from a clan with higher status than normal for the campaign. For Tsolyáni, there is nothing more important than clan, and so this feat can be highly beneficial. However, it can also prove divisive: other characters in the campaign will find it very difficult to associate with you socially.

Prerequisites: May only be selected at 1st level.

Benefit: Your clan is one clan Level higher than the norm for the campaign. For example, if other characters in the campaign are from High Clans, you are from a Very High Clan.

Special: This feat counts for all purposes as two feats — you may only select it instead of selecting two other feats. The GM may restrict this feat within the campaign — consult with him or her before selecting it.

[H4] Greatly Blessed

Your supernatural patron regards you as an especially favored associate.

Prerequisite: Cha 17, Lucky, Blessed.

Benefit: You are notably blessed. Once per game session, the player may suggest a specific event she would like to occur, that could conceivably happen by luck, and then make a Charisma check to see if it works. The DC is 10, 15, or 20, depending on how outrageous the luck is, as defined by the GM.

[H4] Harmony Amongst the Five Selves

You have integrated the five elements of your Self.

Prerequisites: Wis 13, must not have the Shadow Scars flaw.

Benefits: Your shadow-self is fully integrated with your personality. This means you can get good quality sleep even in poor conditions, as well as making effective use of cat-naps. When you waken from a sleep, even a short one, you are immediately alert and at least a little refreshed. If you are ever _fatigued_ for any reason, you may sleep for 15 minutes and make a Wisdom check (DC 10) to wake up fully refreshed. You also have good problem-solving capabilities based on a strong intuition (the GM may allow you to make a Wisdom or Intelligence check if you are confronting a problem, giving you a hint if you succeed). You gain a +1 bonus to Teamwork.

[H4] Highly Skilled

You have learned a variety of skills.

Benefit: You gain +4 skill points. These are treated exactly like any other skill points.

Special: This feat may be selected more than once. You gain a further +4 skill points each time you select it.

[H4] Huge Build

You are enormous, a giant in Tsolyáni terms.

Prerequisite: Str 13, Con 13, Large Build, may only be taken at 1st level, may not also select the Attractive feat.

Benefit: You gain a further +1 bonus to Initiative checks and a further +2 meter increase in your Movement Speed. You deal +1 damage in melee attacks because of the weight you can put behind blows, and gain a +2 bonus to all Grapple checks because of your greater leverage. On the down side, you require a huge amount of food and water, are a relatively easy target for missiles (opponents gain a +1 bonus on their missile weapon attack rolls against you), and you have a -2 penalty to Fortitude saves to avoid heat exhaustion. Furthermore, any clothing or armor you buy costs +25% more than usual.

Special: The GM may insist that a Tsolyáni character with this feat also has the Ugly flaw, since people of this size are considered unattractive by most Tsolyáni. Alternatively, this is a suitable feat for a N’lüss barbarian character.

[H4] Hu'on

Your dedication to Ksárul or Grugánu, and your long months of hard training, have been rewarded with some of the secrets of those Temples’ ancient kickboxing martial art.

Prerequisite: Wis 13, Unarmed Attack 2 ranks, Priest, must be a worshipper of Ksárul or Grugánu.

Benefit: You may add your Wisdom bonus to damage you deal when making an unarmed attack, in addition to adding your Strength modifier as usual. This does not apply to grappling attacks, since your training is in kickboxing rather than general martial arts. Furthermore, when you are attacked by any unarmed attack other than a grappling attack, you are considered to have 1 point of Armor.

[H4] Hu'on Mastery

You have mastered the martial art of Hu'on, and attack in a lethal flurry of kicks.

Prerequisite: Wis 15, Unarmed Attack 4 ranks, Hu'on, Priest, must be a worshipper of Ksárul or Grugánu.

Benefit: If you make a full attack with unarmed strikes (not including grappling), you may choose to make one additional attack at your highest attack bonus. If you do so, you suffer a -2 penalty to all your attack rolls this round.

[H4] High Lineage

Your lineage within your clan is highly prestigious.

Prerequisite: May only be taken at 1st level.

Benefit: As compared to other members of your clan, your social rank and status are high. This will affect every interaction you have within your clan. Ordinary clan members will defer to you as a matter of course. When the clan has a new project or expedition in mind, it looks to you to lead its members. You are also both personally wealthier, and trusted with more clan resources, increasing your Resource Points by +50%.

Special: This feat is most important in campaigns set predominantly within a given clan. The GM may wish to allow an additional, tangible benefit for a more general campaign, such as a +2 increase to all Intimidate checks, as well as the usual increase to Resource Points.

The GM may allow a character to ignore the prerequisite and select this feat at a higher level, if there are good in-game reasons for such a change of status. Usually this will only occur if the character’s actions have been so well-respected as to alter the status of his or her entire lineage.

[H4] Hlepurdal

You have been especially trained in the use of sword and dagger together.

Prerequisite: Two-Weapon Defense, Two-Weapon Fighting, Dex 15, Melee Attack 4 ranks, Melee Defense 4 ranks.

Benefit: When you are wielding a long sword or rapier in one hand, and a dagger in the other (this must be a standard dagger, not a punch dagger or stiletto), you gain a +1 enhancement bonus to your total Armor, and a +1 bonus to the damage you deal with the weapons.

[H4] Increased Pedhétl

Your Pedhétl, or magical potential, is higher than is the norm for your race.

Prerequisite: None.

Benefit: Your Pedhétl is increased by +2.

Normal: Most humans have a Pedhétl of 4.

Special: You may select this feat up to three times, increasing your Pedhétl accordingly each time you select the feat.

[H4] Large Build

You are considerably larger than most Tsolyáni of your sex.

Prerequisite: Str 11, Con 11, may only be taken at 1st level.

Benefit: You have a long stride and reach, granting you a +1 bonus to all Initiative checks and a +2 meter increase in your Movement Speed. You also gain a +1 bonus to Intimidate checks, and a +1 bonus to Fortitude saves made specifically to resist the effects of poison or drugs. You also require significantly more food and water than an average Tsolyáni, however.

[H4] Legion Training

You have spent some time in one of the Legions, and have learned some of the basic formations and combat techniques of that Legion. Determine the Legion you have joined in consultation with the GM, and also determine if you are still an active member.

Prerequisites: Base Attack Bonus +5, must have signed up as a member of a Legion.

Benefit: You gain Formation Drill and Formation Combat, two class features of the Legionary class (see p. XX). If you already have one or both of those class features, you will instead gain later Formation class features so long as your Base Attack Bonus is sufficiently high — see the descriptions under the Legionary class for more details.

Special: This feat is designed to be cumulative with the Formation class features from the Legionary class, so that multi-classed characters can gain this feat as well as gaining levels in Legionary so as to remain on a par with the other members of their Legion.

[H4] Local Hero

You did something notably good at some point in the past, perhaps saving a small child from a burning barn or winning a medal in the war. You are something of a local hero, and a large number of ordinary people are well disposed you.

Prerequisite: Good Reputation, Cha 13, Wis 13.

Benefit: Your reputation has spread to the province around your city, or to the nearest large city to your province. Increase your Respect by a further +10 Points.

[H4] Lucky

You have the attention of some supernatural patron. This may be a god, spirit, demon, etc.

Prerequisite: Cha 13

Benefit: Your patron tends to protect you and make you a little luckier, at least when it is paying attention. You benefit particularly in the immediate area (within 5 + Charisma bonus meters) of a suitably mystical place (a shrine to the relevant god, or a demonic altar, etc.), or just after (within 5 + Charisma bonus rounds) you make a ritual sacrifice to the entity. When you have its attention in this way, you may reroll any natural roll of 1 on any die roll, if you so choose (including skill checks, attack rolls, saving throws, defense rolls, damage dice, etc.). You may continue to reroll until you get a result that is not a 1.

Special: The player and GM should discuss the specific details of this feat. In some cases, the player may be happy to leave the details up to the GM, with the character not yet even suspecting that they have a non-human patron. At the other extreme, the player may want her character to have a demonic pact, and have strong ideas about the pitfalls and benefits of such a dread deal.

[H4] Magic Dampener

Something in your makeup interferes with the drawing of extra-planar energy. You act as a natural dampener to magic of all kinds.

Prerequisites: Iron Will, Wis 13, may only by selected at 1st level.

Benefit: Spells cannot be cast within one meter of the character (friendly or hostile). The character cannot be psychically read or detected, and cannot cast magical Spells of any kind. Magical items that draw upon the user’s energy cannot be used at all within the affected area (by the character or by others). Items that possess charges may be used once within the affected area but must be removed from the area around the Dampener before being able to activate another charge (the next charge will not “load” within the dampened area). The character cannot activate scrolls, books, inscriptions, or other "triggered" enchantments — those that require a psychic "spark" from the reader. Thus, a Dampener can read a scroll but it will not activate but he or she also cannot trigger a sorcerous trap that requires reading.

Special: Dampeners are rare, and the GM should consider whether such a character will be too disruptive to the campaign before approving this feat. Certainly it is reasonable to apply a restriction of one such character per campaign.

[H4] Magician

You have begun the difficult task of learning either Ritual Magic or Psychic Magic

Prerequisite: Pedhétl 6; either Cha 13 _or_ Int 13.

Benefit: Choose either Ritual Magic (so long as you have an Intelligence of 13 or higher) or Psychic Magic (so long as you have a Charisma of 13 or higher). If you chose Ritual Magic, you may now learn the Magic: Ritual skill. If you chose Psychic Magic, you may now learn the Magic: Psychic skill. Note that this feat does not make the Magic skill a class skill if it was not already, but merely enables you to gain the skill at all.

Normal: The Magic skill may not be learned by a character who does not possess this feat.

Special: You may select this feat a second time, so long as you meet the prerequisite for the type of magic you did not select the first time. You may now learn the other Magic skill.

[H4] Multiattack

Prerequisite: Three or more natural attacks.

Benefit: The creature’s secondary attacks with natural weapons take only a –2 penalty.

Normal: Without this feat, the creature’s secondary attacks with natural weapons take a –5 penalty.

[H4] Multiweapon Fighting

Prerequisites: Dex 13, three or more hands.

Benefit: Penalties for fighting with multiple weapons are reduced by 2 with the primary hand and reduced by 6 with off hands.

Normal: A creature without this feat takes a –6 penalty on attacks made with its primary hand and a –10 penalty on attacks made with its off hands. (It has one primary hand, and all the others are off hands.) See Two-Weapon Fighting_._

Special: This feat replaces the Two-Weapon Fighting feat for creatures with more than two arms.

[H4] Overbearing Attacker

Through a combination of strength and skill, you have developed a fighting style that revolves around using maximum force against your enemy, knocking their weapons flying or knocking them right out of your way as necessary.

Prerequisite: Combat Expertise, Power Attack, Int 15, Str 15

Benefit: You gain a +4 bonus on all attempts to disarm an opponent, and on all overrun attempts you make.

[H4] Performer

You are a virtuoso performer in a number of different performance styles, with that quality of excellence mingled with exhibitionism that can make a truly world-class performance artist.

Prerequisites: Cha 13.

Benefit: You gain a +3 bonus to all Perform checks.

[H4] Priest

You have passed the examinations required to become a Priest or Priestess of the 1st Circle devoted to your chosen deity.

Prerequisites: Knowledge: Religion 4 ranks, plus either Wis 13 _or_ Int 13 _or_ Cha 13.

Benefit: You gain Ritual (chosen deity) (Int) as a class skill. This remains the case whatever your class may be or become. In most cases, you will also gain more respect from other worshippers of your chosen deity, as well as higher pay than a non-Priest, assuming that you work for your Temple in some capacity (typically as an administrative priest, scholar priest, ritual priest, or Temple guard). You may choose not to work directly for your Temple, but simply to be a lay priest, in which case you are free to roam and adventure as you will.

[H4] Promotion: Imperial

You have received a promotion to a rank two circles higher than you had before.

Prerequisites: Administrate 4 ranks, Int 13, must work for the Imperium in a civilian role (usually as an Expert: Bureaucrat).

Benefit: Increase your rank by +2 circles. Your income will usually increase too (see p. XX).

Normal: Most characters have to work to gain promotions, acquiring higher ranks through in-game achievement.

Special: This feat may be selected more than once. Each time it is selected, your rank increases by +2 circles. If your rank is already 10th Circle or higher, you may not select this feat.

[H4] Promotion: Military

You have received a promotion to the rank higher than the one you had before.

Prerequisites: Knowledge: Military 4 ranks, must work for the Imperium, a Clan, or a Temple in a military role (usually as a Guard, Legionary, or Scout, but sometimes as a Sorcerer, Expert, Noble, or other class).

Benefit: Increase your rank to the next highest rank. Your income will usually increase too (see p. XX).

Normal: Most characters have to work to gain promotions, acquiring higher ranks through in-game achievement.

Special: This feat may be selected more than once. Each time it is selected, your rank increases to the next highest rank. If your rank is already Kási or higher, you may not select this feat.

[H4] Promotion: Temple

You have received a promotion to a rank two circles higher than you had before.

Prerequisites: Priest, Cha 13.

Benefit: Increase your rank by +2 circles. Your income will usually increase too (see p. XX).

Normal: Most characters have to work to gain promotions, acquiring higher ranks through in-game achievement.

Special: This feat may be selected more than once. Each time it is selected, your rank increases by +2 circles. If your rank is already 10th Circle or higher, you may not select this feat.

[H4] Psychic Mesh

You have trained as a highly specialized telepathic communicator, able to send and receive psychic messages across continents.

Prerequisites: _Ascertainment_, Wis 15, Magic: Psychic 12 ranks, Teamwork 12 ranks.

Benefit: You may learn the _long range telepathy_ Spell Specialization of the _ascertainment_ spell, paying the usual cost in Spell Points to do so. See the spell description for more details (p. XX). This capability is so scarce and highly valued that you will also almost certainly receive some kind of promotion, assuming that you work for a Temple or for the Imperium (typically +1 Circle, though this is entirely at the GM’s discretion).

Normal: Characters without this feat can never learn the _long range telepathy_ Spell Specialization of the _ascertainment_ spell.

[H4] Renowned Hero.

You are spoken of throughout Tsolyánu as a true hero.

Prerequisite: Good Reputation, Local Hero, Cha 15, Wis 15.

Benefit: Your reputation has spread throughout the Empire. This is appropriate for a war hero or a member of the local community so upstanding as to be spoken of even beyond his or her home. If your character has not yet done remarkable deeds within the context of the game, you must develop a reasonable back story in consultation with the GM to justify this. Increase your Respect by a further +10 Points.

[H4] Retainer

You have a retainer or bodyguard — an almost constant companion who is extremely loyal and protective.

Prerequisite: Great Clan _or_ character level 4.

Benefit: Create a character to be your retainer. The retainer may be of any character class and is created according to whichever rules are in play for creating player characters. The retainer will be two levels lower than your level (minimum 1st level). A retainer will never be of higher social standing than you, but could be of equal clan status.

[H4] Scholar

Book-learning comes easily to you, and you remember almost everything you have read.

Prerequisites: Int 13.

Benefit: You gain a +3 bonus to all Knowledge checks.

[H4] Skein of Destiny

The Tsolyáni believe that everyone has a destiny, and some features of it may be divined (by astrology, for example). Any major Temple can have a divination performed, but it is easy for your character to be unaware that he or she has this feat.

Prerequisite: At least one Ability Score 15

Benefit: You are destined to die violently. This may not seem like much of an advantage, but it does mean that you cannot be killed by non-violent means. You may be injured, crippled, scarred, hideously maimed, or put in a coma, but you cannot be killed except by violence.

[H4] Small Build

You are quite small and slim.

Prerequisite: Dex 13, _maximum_ of Str 16 (or 2 points below usual racial maximum, if nonhuman), must not also have the Large Build feat, may only be selected at 1st level.

Benefit: You have the small, slim build commonly associated with dancers and acrobats. You are a harder target for missile attacks (-1 penalty to all ranged attack rolls against you). You also have an excellent power to weight ratio and so are able to use either your Strength modifier or Dexterity modifier for Climb and Jump checks, whichever is higher. Finally, you require slightly less food and water than an average Tsolyáni.

[H4] Special Item

You own an extraordinary, and perhaps even magical, object. You might have inherited it as a family heirloom, found it in an ancient tomb, looted it from an enemy, or even stolen it.

Prerequisites: May only be taken at 1st level.

Benefit: The special item you own is considerably more powerful or unusual than would be expected for someone of your background. This feat is best suited to a Heroic Fantasy campaign (see p. XX); the GM may wish to restrict or even ban it in other campaigns. You gain 75 Resource Points to spend on the item; these points cannot be spent on anything else. Resource Points gained from this feat cannot be increased by the Wealth or High Lineage feats or reduced by the Low Lineage or Poor flaws. See Designing Special Items, page xxx, for info on the resource costs of creating a special item. You and the GM should discuss and agree on the manner in which the item came into your possession.

Special: This feat may be selected more than once. You gain +75 Resource Points to spend on the item each time, allowing you to acquire an even more valuable item.

[H4] Spells

You have had a chance to learn some additional spells, and perhaps some new Specializations within those spells.

Prerequisites: Pedhétl 4, Magician.

Benefit: You gain +20 Spell Points (see p. XX). You may spend these on new spells as usual.

Special: You may select this feat more than once, gaining +20 Spell Points each time.

[H4] Tiny Build

You are very small and slim.

Prerequisite: Dex 15, Small Build, _maximum_ of Str 12 (or 6 points below usual racial maximum, if nonhuman), must not also have the Large Build feat, may only be selected at 1st level.

Benefit: You have the perfect build for an acrobat (+1 bonus to Tumble and Hide checks). You are small enough to be a harder target (in addition to the -1 penalty on any ranged attacks against you, as gained from Small Build, attackers also have a -1 penalty on melee attacks against you). You require only half the food and water of an average Tsolyáni.

[H4] Water Tolerance

For some reason, you do not have the (eminently sensible) fear of water exhibited by most Pé Chói. Perhaps you have deliberately trained yourself to tolerate short exposures to water, or else you are naturally fearless with regard to immersion.

Prerequisites: Race: Pé Chói, Wis 13.

Benefit: You do not have the Water Phobia racial trait. Furthermore, you gain a +4 bonus on Concentration checks to keep your spiracles closed.

Normal: Most Pé Chói have a phobia of water, and this causes them to panic — and usually to drown_._

[H4] Wealth

Your family is considerably wealthier than is typical for its status. Often a relatively low-status clan can be quite wealthy, due to good luck, careful management, or simply its presence in one of the largest, richest cities, such as Béy Sü, Jakálla, or Avanthár. This will not help with your reputation or social status, but money can buy most other things.

Prerequisites: None.

Benefit: Multiply your Resource Points by 2.

Special: May usually only be selected at 1st level; may be selected at a later date only with the GM’s special permission. This feat may be selected a second time; multiply your Resource Points by 2 again, for a total multiplication of x4.

[H4] Wild Empathy

You have a particular way, or knack, with animals.

Prerequisite: Cha 13, Animal Affinity

Benefit: You may improve the attitude of any animal or magical beast. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person. You rolls 1d20 and adds your character level and your Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals and magical beasts are usually unfriendly. To use wild empathy, the you and the creature must be able to study each other, which means that you must be within 10 metres of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing a creature in this way takes 1 minute, but as with influencing people, it might take more or less time. Any attempt to use this feat to influence a magical beast is done at a -4 penalty.

[H3] Flaws

#### The following flaws may be selected by characters in _Tékumel d20_. A character may select up to two flaws. Each flaw selected allows the character to select an additional feat. Flaws may only be selected at 1st level.

[H4] Addicted

Addiction on Tékumel is not inherently stigmatized, but it can lead to ignoble action, if not kept under some kind of control. You might be addicted to drugs, alcohol, risk, gambling, sex, violence, or just about any activity possible. You have a constant need to partake in this activity, irrespective of your conscious desires.

Penalties: The character is severely addicted. He or she must make a Will save to resist temptation every five minutes of exposure, beginning at DC 15 but with the DC increasing by 5 for each five minutes. A DC 15 Will save is also required if the character wishes to stop indulging in the drug, unless something extreme (being attacked, lack of ready funds, unconsciousness) stops him or her first. Additionally, the character must spend 25% of all skill points on skills related to directly or indirectly to the addiction (GM's discretion). A character with this flaw may not select the Iron Will feat.

[H4] Arrogant

You are arrogant far beyond your actual status and capabilities.

Penalties: You are arrogant and over-confident, feeling that you are considerably more capable and impressive than you really are. Pick an Ability Score or Skill that you believe is +4 higher than it actually is. Furthermore, any loss of Respect doubled, since you are so sensitive to your actual inferiority. You are frequently boastful, which may lead to all kinds of problems, including unwanted arena challenges if you boast of martial prowess. A Will save (DC 15) is required to avoid some idiotic confrontation each week; for a less combative character, this could be an intellectual falling-out with another scholar or priest, or an argument over trade. A character with this flaw may not select the Iron Will feat.

[H4] Bad Reputation

At some point in the past, you acted ignobly or dishonorably. Even now, people remember your shame, which is a constant burden. Any time you must prove your worth, doing so will be considerably more difficult than it would be for most.

Penalties: Your disgrace is well-known, and it would take repeated demonstrations of heroism and indisputable honor before you might start to be forgiven. You begin play with one full negative Level of Reputation.

[H4] Clumsy

You are often distracted when performing minor physical tasks, and so become clumsy. Fortunately you are able to remain focused when in combat.

Penalties: You have a -2 penalty on Dexterity-based skill checks and Reflex saves when not in combat. You regularly embarrass yourself with minor but very noticeable acts of clumsiness. Your friends watch you warily whenever you pick up a sword, knowing you are liable to trip over it, accidentally stab yourself, or drop it on their toes at any moment. You may not select the Lightning Reflexes feat.

[H4] Debts of Honor

You owe large Favors to one or more major NPCs, far beyond the typical Favors owed by someone of your social class. Perhaps you owe them your life, or they saved you from total social disgrace at significant cost to their own reputation. They may call on you to repay these Favors at any time. Once the Favors are repaid, the GM may assign you a different Flaw to replace this one.

Penalties: You owe eight Medium Favors, four Big Favors, and one Huge Favor (see p. XX).

[H4] Fragile

You may be sickly, or simply psychologically unsuited to the pains and rigors of everyday life, but either way you are significantly less tough than most.

Penalties: -1 penalty to starting Hit Points, and a -2 penalty to all Fortitude saves. A character with this flaw may not select the Great Fortitude or Toughness feats.

[H4] Greedy

You desperately covet wealth and possessions of all kinds, even to the point of committing crimes to get your hands on them.

Penalties: You must succeed at a Will check (DC 20) to resist any such opportunities to acquire wealth or valuable objects, whether to do so would be dishonorable or not. You are particularly willing to be bribed (DC 25 Will check).

[H4] Impulsive

You have very little control of your emotions.

Penalties: You are flight and emotional, and must make a Will save to resist provocation of any kind. You are not really interested in others’ emotions, taking a -2 penalty on all Sense Motive and Gather Information checks. If you are under great stress, the GM may specify which emotions your character is feeling, and you must roleplay accordingly. You must make a Will save (DC 15) to resist openly displaying whatever emotion you feel at the time. A character with this flaw may not select the Iron Will feat.

[H4] Indecisive

You often find yourself near-paralyzed by indecision.

Penalties: You find it hard to make your mind up, frequently freezing up during combat or other stressful situations. You have a -2 penalty on Initiative rolls, and a -1 penalty on Defense rolls. A character with this flaw may not select the Improved Initiative feat.

[H4] Low Lineage

You are from a low-status lineage within your clan, with less access to clan wealth and other privileges. You are rarely given positions of power or command.

Penalties: Your Resource Points are multiplied by 0.5.

[H4] Low Pedhétl

The character has a lower than average ability to store magical energy. The main effects on a non-spellcaster are to reduce the character’s ability to resist spells, and reduce the effectiveness of benevolent magic.

Penalties: The character’s Pedhétl value is 1. He or she has a -1 penalty on all Will saving throws against spells. Any benevolent spell cast on him or her is cast with a -4 penalty on the Magic check. A character with this flaw may not select the Magic or Increased Pedhétl feats.

[H4] Minor Clan

Your clan is of a lower status than those of your comrades.

Penalties: Your clan is one clan Level lower than typical clans in the campaign. For example, if everyone else belongs to Medium clans, you are a member of a Low clan. You may not select the Great Clan feat, and may never gain levels in the Noble class.

Note: This flaw counts as two flaws in all respects, that is, it is the only flaw the character may take, but taking it grants two feats rather than just one.

[H4] Nemesis

The character has a personal enemy, rival, or other entanglement who regularly causes difficulty. The Nemesis may be an enemy trying to harm the character, a rival in love, a business competitor, etc.

Penalties: The nemesis is an enemy who causes significant problems on a regular basis. This person is not necessarily hostile, but his or her goals conflict with those of the character. The nemesis will have higher status than the character, and will be one character level higher than the character at all times.

[H4] Physical Impairment

For most Tsolyáni, medicine is a primitive affair; physical impairment is not uncommon among the lower clans. Higher-clan people are more likely to have access to magical healing, and are thus less likely to have this flaw. A veteran of the legions, however, may have an amputated limb after infection, while occupational accidents for farmers, sailors, and artisans are common. The Game Master should consider the availability of healing magic in his or her campaign before allowing a player to assign this flaw, ruling that the injury is incurable by magic. The examples listed below are not exhaustive; others are possible.

Penalties: The character is seriously disabled. This effectively precludes a large range of actions and makes others extremely difficult (-4 penalty). For example:

[BEGIN BULLET LIST]

Blind: This prevents normal reading, makes traversing unfamiliar territory difficult, and makes combat next to impossible. The character automatically fails Spot checks, and has a -4 penalty to all Search checks or other checks for which vision would be an advantage.

No legs: The character can, with difficulty, use arms to pull him or herself along. His or her Movement Speed is reduced to 25% of normal.

Paraplegic: The character is paralysed from the waist down.

[END BULLET LIST]

[H4] Poor

Characters with this Defect come from a family, or clanhouse, that is poorer than average for its status. This usually means the character is from a rural area or small town, where everyone is poor by city standards (for campaigns set in a remote rural area, the GM may wish to assign this flaw to all characters). This does not affect the character’s social standing.

Penalties: Multiply Resource Points by 0.25.

[H4] Responsibilities

The character has important responsibilities that affect his or her life, resources, and free time.

Penalties: The character must be on call regularly and cannot travel freely. For example, a soldier on active service must travel with his or her unit, take turns at sentry duty, and may have to fight. This leaves little room for independent action. Cross-class skills may not be learnt. This flaw is not usually permitted in campaigns in which all characters have similar commitments by virtue of the campaign set-up, such as a military campaign in which all characters are members of the same Legion.

[H4] Clanless

The character is Nakomé (clanless).

Penalties: The character is regarded as scum by “decent” Tsolyáni standards. He or she may be a foreigner, or simply an outcast. He or she has a -4 penalty to all Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks relating to anyone who does have a clan and who knows him or her to be Nakomé. For humans only (most nonhumans have a similar disadvantage already).

[H4] Shadow Scars

The character has some form of injury to his or her incorporeal shadow-self. A common source of this is intense trauma, like the shock of battle wounds. To the Tsolyáni, this is as real as physical damage. Recognition and treatment are available for it within medical and magical systems. For characters with this flaw, however, these scars will never heal.

Penalties: Choose either Amputated Dreamlife or Waking Echo. A character with this flaw may not select the Iron Will or Harmony Amongst the Five Selves feats.

Amputated Dreamlife. The character has lost his or her capacity to dream, finds it difficult to stay asleep, is easily disturbed (which is occasionally beneficial), and wakes up too early in the morning. Unless the character sleeps in near-perfect conditions, he or she suffers the effects of sleeplessness, imposing a -2 penalty to the following skill checks: Concentration, Craft, Disable Device, Knowledge, Listen, Magic, Move Silently, Perform, Pick Lock, Profession, Research, Spot, Wilderness Tracking. This penalty increases by -2 per day until he or she receives a decent night’s sleep.

Waking Echo. A specific common experience (such as the sight of weapons, or the smell of damp grass), if combined with any stressful conditions (imminent combat, anxiety, or pain) triggers a Shadowscape even if the character is awake, unless he or she succeeds at a Will save (DC 20). This usually paralyses the character for several minutes while he or she runs through the harrowing Shadowscape. The character feels exhausted after awakening.

[H4] Ugly

This Defect describes a character who does not fit the Tsolyáni ideal of beauty.

Penalties: The character is either outright ugly or has a physical trait that is disturbing to the Tsolyáni (such as blue eyes, thought to indicate a curse by the Goddess Avánthe). The character suffers significant prejudice if the flaw is visible, involving at least a -4 penalty to Charisma-based skill checks and Charisma checks relating to other Tsolyáni. While blue eyes are easier to conceal than simple ugliness, they also provoke far worse reactions (children with them are often killed at birth).

[H4] Child

Characters generally begin the campaign at age 20 or so, and their starting capabilities reflect that. Characters with this flaw begin the campaign as children.

Penalties: The character is approximately 12 years old — a child by Tsolyáni law and custom. He or she has a -4 penalty to Strength, though his or her Strength will increase by +1 per year for the next four years as full adult potential is achieved. Furthermore, adults will not take the character seriously, and he or she has a -2 penalty to all Charisma-based skills until achieving the age of majority (15). A character with this flaw may not also select the Toughness or Highly Skilled feats.

[H1] Chapter 5: Equipment and Economics

[H2] Handling Money

The GM should determine the best way to handle finances in your _Tékumel d20_ campaign, probably in consultation with players. Many groups prefer not to have to keep track of every last hlásh that every character acquires or spends, though that approach can certainly work. For example in a low-status campaign that revolves around an economic and literal fight for survival, every hlásh really does count – so it makes sense to even count every qirgál, because it could make the difference as to whether or not the character eat that night. Likewise, in a campaign that revolves around a merchant clan's trading trips, it makes sense to keep close track of finances.

For a campaign that is more about high-status characters (who regard money and bills as somewhat beneath them, anyway), it may be best for the GM to simply allow each player to have access to whatever resources seem reasonable, based on their status and wealth (taking account of their Clan, and if they have it, the Wealthy feat). If they want access to especially high-cost items, those might need to be purchased through their clans, with the clan retaining ownership of it.

The Access to Clan Resources rules (p. XX) can be used as a middle ground, allowing the GM to assume that characters will have status-based expenses and status-based income that more-or-less balance out, at least while at home, but perhaps requiring the players to keep more careful track of coinage while on adventures.

[H2] Tsolyáni Currency

Though iron is rare, and thus, staggeringly valuable, on Tékumel, more terrestrially valuable metals are not quite so scarce. Thus, the currency is based around small coins of gold, silver, and copper. The gold coin is the 3-gram káitar. A káitar is worth 20 silver hlásh, with each hlásh worth 20 copper qirgál

[BEGIN CHART]

Coin Material Quantity per káitar

káitar gold 1

hlásh silver 20

qirgál copper 400

[END CHART]

Low Clan Tsolyáni may never even see a káitar up close, and rarely or never handle a single hlásh. On the other hand, High or Very High clanmembers actively prefer not to know about money, or precisely how wealthy they are, thinking that such concerns are beneath them. Thus, they may never see anything smaller than a káitar, and even regard such gold coins as rather vulgar. Such nobles expect their servants to deal with all financial matters.

Clanhouses offer banking facilities, and most Tsolyáni make use of them, rather than carrying a great deal of cash with them. For transporting large sums from one place to another, the practical solution is to either carry a draft from one's clanhouse treasury, or simply convert the cash to high-value, low-bulk gems, which can be resold on arrival.

[H2] Access to Clan Resources

All clanmembers, of however lowly a status in however lowly a clan, have access to equipment and other resources from their clan storehouses. A Tsolyáni's first thought, on realizing the need for a particular item, would not be "where can I buy it?" but "does my clan already own one that I could borrow?" Table X-X: Access to Purchases (page xxx) gives a good indication of what kind of things a character could get access to, depending on their starting Resource Points. A Wealthy character (see p. XX) comes from a richer clanhouse, and thus has access to more or better resources. Note that however wealthy or high-status one is, generally, a small, poor, rural clanhouse may simply not own the same resources as one's usual home clanhouse (though in most cases, the rural clanhouse administrators will try their hardest to fulfill any requests from such visiting nobles, for the sake of honor). Likewise, even a poor clanmember may be able to gain access to more resources than usual when visiting an especially rich clanhouse, even allowing for a certain amount of suspicion of the "poverty-stricken yokels" on the clanhouse administrators' part.

Access Value

If a character wishes to use clan resources, follow this procedure:

Take the item's worth in káitars

Divide this worth by the character's Resource Points. This determines the Access Value of the item.

If a character has a negative Reputation, an item's Access Value increases by one category for each level of negative Reputation. Conversely, a positive Reputation decreases the item's Access Value by one category per two levels. The GM can increase the category if a character has irregular finances, particularly if the clan quartermaster suspects them of keeping money back from the coffers. Likewise, if the character is in the clan elders' bad books for whatever reason, the Access Value category may increase.

[[ITALIC]]Example:

Elechu has 50 Resource Points. He needs a physician's bag (80 káitars). For Elechu, the physician's bag has an Access Value of 1.6 (80 ÷ 50 = 1.6). As this is between 1 and 2, he can have the bag, so long as he explains exactly what it is for, and agrees to return it after use. If he had one level of negative Reputation, he would effectively have an Access Value of 2 to 5, and thus would probably only get the physician's bag if on clan business (and would need to account for every bandage and ointment he used in the process).[[ITALIC]]

[BEGIN CHART]

Table X-X: Access to Purchases

Access Value Description of Access

up to 0.25 Unlimited personal use. You do not need permission for this item, and the quartermaster probably doesn't even make a note that you have taken one.

0.25 to 0.5 Near-unlimited personal use. Again, the quartermaster doesn't question you over your need for it, but might start to notice if you regularly started taking several of them.

0.5 to 1 Limited personal use. You would need to demonstrate a specific need for the item. The quartermaster probably wouldn't try too hard to verify the facts of your need, but would certainly take a note of your loan of the item, and would expect to see it back eventually, in good condition.

1 to 2 Very limited personal use. Again, you would need to prove a need for the item. The quartermaster will pay attention to your request, considering it carefully and possibly making specific investigations as to the veracity of your supposed need. You would be expected to return it as soon as your need was over, and might be given a specific time limit for its use. It would need to be returned promptly and in good condition.

2 to 5 Limited clan use. You would need to prove that not only did you need the item, but that your having it would provide a specific benefit to the clan. It must be returned intact as soon as your task is over, or as soon your task stops benefiting the clan.

5 to 10 Very limited clan use. This item will only be issued as part of a clan project, rather than a personal one. The clanmaster and clan elders must be aware of, and approve of, the project. It will be made clear to you that the clan retains full possession and ownership of the item at all times; you are not so much being loaned it, as being made temporary custodian of it for the good of the clan.

10+ GM's discretion only. Again, this would only be issued as part of a clan project, and the clan elders would want to ensure the PC was closely supervised throughout. If it is issued at all, it is unlikely to be issued to a single clan member; rather, an entire group must take responsibility for its safe and prompt return.

[END CHART]

Clans do vary in the equipment they have available, and will not, of course, be able to loan out anything they do not possess! Unusual or rare items, particularly magical or steel items, may be totally unavailable, unless the clan specializes in dealing with such things.

[H2] Income and Expenses

Most characters will have some kind of monthly income, and all will have regular monthly expenses, even if living in clan accommodation.

[H3] Income

Income varies according to character rank, skills, social status, and location.

Income and expense figures are listed in káitars, unless otherwise specified.

[H4] The Professions

Anyone with an official position, such as a government official or priest, will receive pay based on Circle Rank (or military rank, for those who are members of a Legion in any capacity). At lower ranks, these salaries are quite poor, but clans are often willing to assist characters in such positions, in the hope of later repayment in influence once the characters are of higher rank.

[H5] The Government

Government salaries are given in Table X-X, but can be considered a starting point, only. The figures given assume a large city; reduce by 10% for a smaller city or large town, or 25% for small-town or rural areas. A character who is willing to accept bribes may earn considerably more, depending on the precise nature of his or her work.

[H5] The Priesthood

Priest salaries are the same as those of government officials (again, refer to Table X-X), at least for Ritual Priests. Administrative Priests are paid a little more (+5%). Priests in Cohorts are paid less (-10%), and any other priests not listed above are also paid less (-5%). The priest salary scale does not apply to temple guards, who are paid according to their military rank (see Table X-X).

[END TABLE]

The salaries in Table X-X apply to members of Legions. Temple Guards are regarded as more prestigious, and so are paid more (+10%). Other guards and police are generally seen as less prestigious, being paid considerably less (10% less for Sákbe Road Guards, 15% less for Militia and Tomb Police, and 50% to 70% less for town or village constables, depending on the size and wealth of the settlement).

[H4] Clan Employment

Those who work for their clan are generally paid according to how skilled they are (measured in Skill Ranks), the status and perceived value of their profession (usually dependent on clan level), and the location he or she is working in.

Table X-X: Profession Salaries

Monthly Income by Skill Ranks (káitars)

High elite professional (Sorcerer's Bodyguard, Clanmaster) 7.5 15 25 50 100 200 400

The GM should feel free to adjust theses figures to between 50% and 200% of the values given in Table X-X, depending on the wealth and size of the clanhouse in question.

For Legionaries, use whichever is highest from the following: Attack Bonus (including Base Attack Bonus, plus the highest of Str and Dex bonus), Teamwork ranks, Knowledge: Military ranks.

For Guards, use whichever is highest from the following: Attack Bonus (including Base Attack Bonus, the highest of Str and Dex bonus), Knowledge: Religion ranks, Spot ranks.

[H5] Self-Employment

Those who are self-employed will find their income varying randomly each month, depending on the relative success or failure of their business at that point. Their base income is the same as that found in Table X-X: Profession Salaries. This is then modified based on a skill check (roll on Knowledge: Business, Knowledge: Nobility, or Appraise, whichever is highest). Refer the result of the skill check to Table X-X: Modified Income.

Check Result Modified Income

4 or less No income (-100%)

5 to 9 -70%

10 to 14 -30%

15 to 19 No modifier

20 to 24 +20%

25 to 29 +40%

30 to 35 +60%

Etc. Etc.

Merchants take even larger risks; do the same thing, but modify the result as follows:

Check Result Modified Income

4 or less No income; instead, you make a loss equivalent to 1d6 x 100% of your income. If you cannot pay, and your clan will not bail you out, you will be sold into slavery.

5 to 9 No income (-100%)

10 to 14 -50%

15 to 19 No modifier

20 to 24 +40%

25 to 29 +80%

30 to 35 +120%

Etc. Etc.

[H4] Investment

It is always possible for a character with surplus money to invest in business ventures, property, caravans, etc. Usually it is expected that they will invest this money in their clan's various enterprises, though this is certainly not a strict requirement.

Broadly, each investment opportunity can be divided into Low Risk, Medium Risk, and High Risk categories, whatever the nature of the business. Prior to investing, a character may make an Appraise check (DC 15) to determine how risky the venture is.

Each month, whichever character is managing the investment makes a Knowledge: Business skill check, then cross-checks the result with the riskiness of the business on Table X-X to determine how much is gained or lost that month.

Table X-X: Investment Results

Check Result Gain or Loss

Low Risk Medium Risk High Risk

4 or less No gain; you lose your initial stake, too, as a merchant venture goes bust or your clan makes a very poor business decision.

5 to 9 Loss of 10% Loss of 20% Loss of 30%

10 to 14 Loss of 5% Loss of 10% Loss of 15%

15 to 19 No gains or losses

20 to 24 Gain of 5% Gain of 10% Gain of 15%

25 to 29 Gain of 10% Gain of 20% Gain of 30%

30 to 35 Gain of 15% Gain of 30% Gain of 45%

Etc. Etc. Etc. Etc.

Of course, the GM may modify the check as appropriate. For example, characters who become directly or indirectly involved in a particular business venture (perhaps dealing with the bandits who have plagued the clan's caravan route for many months), the GM may give a significant bonus or penalty to the skill check.

[H3] Expenses

Every character will have a monthly expenses tally, based on food, dependents, staff, taxes, etc.

[H4] Basic Expenditures

Basic monthly expenses are worked out according to the character's income. Status is so vital in Tsolyánu society that characters will find their expenses increasing as their income does, just so that they can maintain the lifestyle expected of their status.

Most characters will live in clanhouses. Doing so costs 50% of income, to cover food, lodging, and other monthly expenses. It costs 45% if living in a barracks or temple situation, but 60% if living in private accommodation.

Merchants may subtract half their Haggle percentage (if any) from their living costs. A high-income character spends proportionately less on expenses (5% less for a monthly income over 100 káitars; 10% less if over 500 káitars).

Dependents increase expenses by 5% per spouse (assuming they are not working), or 1% per child under 12.

[H4] Income Tax

Assess a further 1% off all characters' incomes to account for income tax. Cheats are likely to be punished severely.

[H4] Servants and Slaves

Any character who has servants or slaves must pay further costs for them: wages for servants, or upkeep costs for slaves. Paid members of staff expect wages according to their skills and social class, as found on Table X-X: Clan Employment (see p. XX).

Slaves cost around 3% of their purchase price, every month, to keep them clothed, fed, and generally happy.

A servant or slave being underpaid will tend to perform poorly and grudgingly, or even leave (attempt escape, in the case of a slave), in extreme circumstances. Of course, a character wishing to reward or encourage exceptional service can always pay more.

[H2] Weights and Measures

_Tékumel d20_ uses the metric system. Tsolyánu weights and measures are a little different, and are provided here for additional flavor.

[END CHART]

[H2] Items and Prices

Prices here are in káitars, unless noted to the contrary. They are a guideline, based on average prices for average quality goods in typical marketplaces; the GM may alter them according to any unusual factors that may apply, such as the quality of an item (well-made or antique items costing 200% or more of the list price; badly made or second-hand items, as little as 50% less), local variations (for example, chlén-hide items may be cheaper in an area that has a great many chlén), etc.

As ever, Merchants may subtract their Haggle percentage, if any. A character wishing to spend a little time (10 minutes minimum) turning on the charm in the hope of a slight discount may make a Diplomacy check to get a discount (DC 20 for a 5% discount; DC 25 for 10%; a failure to meet at least DC 15 may mean the stallholder takes an active dislike to the character).

[H3] Weapons and Armour

Tékumel has very little iron. The need for something hard and durable to make into armor and weapons has led to the development of chlén-hide, from the chlén-beast. Thick layers of this hide can be harvested twice a year without injury to the chlén, then softened, carved, molded, and hardened. All the processes in turning chlén-hide into its hard, metal-like final form are secrets, guarded carefully by the tanner clans. Chlén-hide weapons and armor do not last so long as steel would, nor hold such a sharp edge, but they are significantly lighter (around 1/3 of the weight of an equivalent steel item). Chlén-hide may shatter in use, and are not repairable, so it is important to carry several spares even on a short campaign.

The Tsolyáni love of decoration means that chlén-hide is rarely seen in its dull greyish state, but is lacquered or painted in a variety of bright colors according to the owner's clan, religion, and personal style.

Steel weapons and armor are very scarce. The small quantities of iron found are soon bought up by rich, high-status temples or legions to turn into steel arms and armor for their own use, and are rarely available for purchase by private individuals.

All prices given in Table X-X assume chlén-hide (or, occasionally, bronze, which is in every way equivalent to chlén-hide in game terms). On rare occasions when steel items become available on the open market, they sell for at least 100 times as much as the equivalents in chlén-hide or bronze, even for the most corroded, rusted old iron sword. A well-made item, with a known history and a reputable manufacturer, could sell for up to 5,000 times as much as the chlén-hide or bronze equivalent.

Asterisked items are not usually made from steel, since non-metal equivalents are easily available and equally good. For example, bows, crossbows, and weapon shafts are generally better when made from wood.

[H4] Custom Weapons

Chlén-hide is easy to carve and mold prior to the hardening process, allowing Tsolyáni chlén-hide crafters to create quite unusual and exotic weaponry. See the Designing Special Items rules (p. XX) for more info.

[H4] Weapons and Armour for Non-humans

Non-human characters will need specially made weapons and armor, since human-made items will not fit or suit them (at least a -4 penalty on relevant rolls or checks, at the GM's discretion; some items may be simply unusable by some species). Specially made weapons are available at the listed price, so long as the non-human character goes to a crafter of his or her own species. Otherwise they will cost double.

NB: An incendiary fire-pot is essentially a primitive incendiary grenade. A thin-walled clay pot is filled with flammable materials, then lit before being thrown (or hurled in a staff-sling). Each pot weighs 2 kg.

[H4] Armour

Ordinary soldiers are usually issued with chlén-hide armor (typically low to middling quality, depending on the legion or temple), but may purchase better quality armor if desired. Even units that possess steel armor do not issue it to soldiers except when immediate battlefield use is anticipated, since it is so scarce and valuable. An officer of Heréksa rank or higher is expected to buy his or her own suit of armor.

The hot climate makes long-term armor use uncomfortable and potentially even dangerous (heat exhaustion is a real risk, particularly for characters in heavy steel armor, so characters not expecting imminent danger tend not to wear it. Dress uniforms are typically made to resemble armor, but offer little or no actual protection (see Clothing, p. XX, for prices for this ceremonial "armor"). Civilians do not tend to wear armor unless their profession is violent or dangerous.

Those non-humans who do not wear clothing, but use straps, baldrics, webbing, harnesses etc. to carry equipment, can buy such items for around 1-10 káitars in most big cities.

[BEGIN CHART]

[H4] Ceremonial Forms of Dress

Ceremonial dress comes in a variety of ever-more-elaborate versions depending on the status and position of the character. Each Form has a very specific style of ceremonial dress, which can be purchased at a cost of 1000 káitars per rank or character level.

[H3] Precious Metals, Gems, and Jewellery

Jewelry on Tékumel has similar uses to elsewhere, in that it can be a display of personal status and social class, or a useful, portable form of wealth. It is also favored for giving gifts and bribes of all kinds, being seen as far more appropriate than hard currency.

To determine the value of an item of jewelry, take the basic cost of the metals and gems involved, then add the labor costs of having goldsmiths and gemcutters work on the piece (typically adding 20% to 200% of the original cost, again, depending on the complexity and skill involved). If it is to be bought retail, the merchant may add another fee on top (anything from 20% to 50% or even more). An antique piece may be slightly or considerably more valuable (another +10% to +1,000% added to the cost, depending on provenance, fame of jeweler, quality, and era).

[H4] Metal Ingots

Metal ingots may also be used as currency.

[H4] Gold Items

Table X-X: Gold Item Costs includes typical costs for gold jewelry, though this can vary enormously depending on the factors listed in this section. Use this table as a guide for jewelry costs in other metals, too, multiplying the price accordingly (for example, an electrum item would cost 70% of the price of the equivalent gold item).

[H4] Gems

A beautiful array of gemstones can be found on Tékumel. Table X-X: Gem Costs lists types of gem with typical prices for 1-carat stones. A flawed or discolored stone may be worth only 70% to 90% of the value given, while a perfect gem might be worth twice as much.

Note that for stones categorized as "precious" or above, significantly larger gems cost significantly more, due to their rarity. As a guideline, multiply the base price by the square of the number of carats; for example, a 7-carat black pearl (usual cost for 1 carat = 60 káitars) will cost 60 x 7 x 7 = 2,940 káitars. This does not apply to the cheaper stones, which can generally be found in larger pieces.

The prices given are for uncut gems. A cut stone will be worth at least twice as much, depending on the quality of the workmanship.

[H4] Beverages

Non-alcoholic drinks are usually sold by the mug (around 0.6 liters), whereas alcoholic drinks are sold by the bottle (2.7 liters).

[BEGIN CHART]

Table X-X: Beverage Costs

Article Price Particulars

A'ásh 3 káitars This is a rough, grain-based alcohol, popular among the lower classes. It is commonly found in Úrmish and Katalál. The most powerful blend is known as Jékw, and is produced in Yán Koryáni.

Chumétl 16 qirgáls This is non-alcoholic beverage of savory Hmélu buttermilk is drunk by every social class throughout Tsolyánu, Yán Kór, Salarvyá, and Mu’ugalavyá. It is salted and heavily spiced, with the precise recipe varying enormously depending on region and social class. Ahoggyá hate it.

Dátsu 6 káitars This robust dlél-fruit brandy is purple-red in color. The Kráa Hills varieties are particularly prized, as are vintages from northeast of Khéiris in Mu’ugalavyá, or the Nuférsh and Kakársh regions in Livyánu. A high-quality bottle might cost 50-100 káitars.

Drónu 12 káitar Drónu is a dark-colored dessert wine made from urtsé berries. A top-quality bottle from Koylúga or Jaekánta could cost up to 100 káitars.

Faóz 6 hlásh This simple rice beer is common in Livyáni, particularly among the working class, but rarely found elsewhere.

Héngka 5 hlásh This wheat or dná beer is found everywhere, but usually regarded as suitable only for commoners. Héngka can be used as a generic term to refer to other relatively weak alcoholic drinks.

Lás 2 qirgáls Lás is an infusion of tíu tree leaves, favored in the north and northeast, and drunk hot. Some add milk, sugar, or salt, depending on region and personal taste.

Másh 10 káitars This is another brandy, though generally better-regarded than dátsu. It is sweet and gold-colored, with a delicate yet exotic flavor. A bottle of the best could cost 100-500 káitars.

Ngálu 5 káitars Ngálu is a common wine, found in all the Five Empires and the surrounding area. A top-quality bottle from a particularly favored vintage could cost 50 káitars or more.

Tsuhóridu 90 káitars This is any one of a variety of swamp liqueurs, made from the crushed seeds of ferns. As well as the usual alcoholic effects, many varieties of tsuhóridu can have other properties, thanks to strange compounds in the seeds, including addiction, hallucination, partial paralysis, paranoia, heightened sexual urges, etc. A particularly fine quality tsuhóridu could cost as much as 1,000 káitars per bottle, but would more usually be sold in tiny cups.

Tuór 24 qirgáls This is a sweet, sherbet-like drink beloved in Livyánu and some regions of Mu’ugalavyá, where it is drunk by all classes of society, with the most expensive varieties (up to 50 káitars for a small cup) being flavored with exotic herbs and spices.

[END CHART]

[H4] Drugs

The common social drugs of Tsolyánu and nearby are typically consumed in clanhouses, or occasionally in public premises hosted by clans specializing in preparing drugs and herbs. Typical prices per kilogram are given on Table X-X: Drug Costs, though these prices may vary: a person buying only a few grams for personal use will of course pay proportionately more, and costs per kilogram can be considerably lower if drugs are bought in the regions they are produced.

Pygmy Folk and Hláka are affected by the listed drugs in the same manner as humans. For most other non-humans, these drugs have no particular effects, though Shén are badly affected by Chümaz (which is a dangerous poison for them) and Ntó (which turns them psychotically angry).

Inevitably, some of the non-human species have their own drugs, such as Fssá roots for Shén and mmuókh bark for Páchi Léi.

[H3] Buildings and Land

It is normal in the Five Empires to live in one's clanhouse, or perhaps in one's quarters at a temple or barracks if a priest or soldier, though occasionally individuals will wish to buy or rent more private accommodation.

[INSERT EXAMPLES OF TSOLYANI BUILDING LAYOUTS]

[H4] Buildings (Rental)

It can be difficult to find suitable buildings for rental, since the practice is relatively unusual. Assume a 25% chance per week of finding an appropriate dwelling for rent. This can be increased to 30% by hiring a merátokoi agent (fee = 50% of the monthly rental, once found).

Table X-X gives monthly rents for various dwellings, assuming a location within the walls of a large city. Reduce the figures by 25% for a small city or town, and by 40% for a village or rural area.

[BEGIN CHART]

19 Medium-sized house or shop: four or so rooms, plus a stone courtyard, bathroom, and kitchen; possibly a small garden; stone or tiled floors.

125 Large house or shop: as above, but with around a dozen rooms. Some rooms may be rented out to subtenants, who cannot usually be evicted due to the vagaries of Tsolyáni law.

500 Minor mansion or small clanhouse: a fancier version of the above, with perhaps two dozen main rooms plus servants' quarters. It may have either an attached garden, orchard, summerhouse, and/or roof garden, depending on the availability of land in the area.

1500 Major mansion, minor palace, or large clanhouse: a still more complex and elaborate version of the above, with around 80 rooms plus servants' quarters, various gardens and minor outbuildings, workshops, storehouses, etc.

12,000 Major palace, or extremely large clanhouse: as above but comprising several main buildings containing hundreds of rooms, house temple, impressive gardens, several outbuildings, etc.

[END CHART]

[H4] Buildings: Construction and Purchase

Costs and time needed to erect an edifice of one's own are adjudged by the GM. The availability of

workers and materials, the location (city, suburban, rural, or wilderness), the willingness of the Imperium to

have such a building at that location, etc. must all be taken into consideration; it is unusual for the Imperium or clans to sell land to private individuals, too. An engineer-architect is required for any building project, and permission to build must be obtained at the Palace of the Realm nearest the site at a cost of 2d6 x 1000 áitars. If older buildings are to be torn down to make way for the new construction, the permission of the Imperium is mandatory: the usual cost of 2d6 x 1000 áitars, plus 2d6 x 1000 áitars in bribes. As an example, a smallish palace could be constructed in a vacant urban area of Jakalla for about 100,000 áitars (plus the costs mentioned above). A fortified mansion would cost 150,000-200,000 in the same place, though it is illegal to fortify private dwellings without Imperial permission (at least 4d6 x 1000 áitars in bribes, unless there is a genuine need). These buildings would cost about 75,000 and 125,000 áitars respectively if built in the suburban areas outside Jakalla's walls, and they would be still cheaper in a rural area, if stone quarries were nearby, and if there were a sufficient labor force in the neighborhood. A small stone castle might be built in the mountains north of Boy Sy for about 250,000 áitars, while the same fortress in the jungles of Cháka would cost double this sum, due to the lack of stone nearby and the paucity of laborers. Buying an existing mansion, palace, or fortress is somewhat cheaper and easier to do. There is around a 30% chance per month of a suitable building becoming available, at a purchase price anywhere from 50,000 to 600,000 áitars, depending upon the building's size, richness of design and furnishings, proximity to the mansions of important personages, etc. A building outside Jakalla would cost less, and one in a rural area still less, and purchase prices will go down similarly. Ruined buildings can also be restored, once the land is purchased or rented from its present owners, or obtained in fief from the Imperium . In certain areas where the central government is weak, occasional ruined fortresses and other buildings may be found which can simply be taken by "squatter's rights" and rebuilt. Costs, rentals, etc . must be judged by the GM, since it is impossible to give a hard and fast rule. Money can be borrowed from the moneylenders to be found at the Palace of the Realm in any large city. A Diplomacy check (base DC 15) will govern the lender's willingness to loan the money, at a monthly interest rate of 2d6%. Such loans must be paid back within three months (the usual time, under ánlaw); otherwise the debtor will be seized and sold as a slave.

[H3] Slaves

Once acquired as slaves or employees by a player, the statistics and operation of the nonplayer character are turned over to his control, and he or she is expected to maintain the nonplayer character, pay for his or her

needs, and keep his or her record sheet. The Imperial slave markets contain those miserable persons who have lost face with their clans, debtors and indigents, minor criminals (spared by some whimsically lenient judge), miscellaneous foreigners, and a few nonhumans .

[H3] Assassination Gear

Assassination gear cannot readily be purchased on the open market, so prices are not listed. These items can generally only be acquired through Assassin Clans or specialist Imperial units.

[H4] Collar of Forever

A garrotte, made from copper wire (or less often from plant fibers), for stealthy sentry elimination. Requires Exotic Weapon Proficiency: Garrotte.

[H4] Deliverer from Existence

This is a flat throwing knife, often carried in sets. The name can be given to any throwing knife, though the assassin's version is typically designed to be disguised and concealed inside another object, such as a scroll case or part of a suit of ceremonial armor. Requires Martial Weapon Proficiency.

[H4] Pa’iya’s Kiss

A Pa’iya’s Kiss is a glass bottle with a handle, designed to be thrown and thus deliver a poison, corrosive fluid, incendiary powders, etc. It can be thrown (Martial Weapon Proficiency) or hurled in a sling (Simple Weapon Proficiency).

[H4] Summoner upon the Way

This is a small pistol-grip crossbow, usually used to shoot poison darts. Requires Exotic Weapon Proficiency: Summoner upon the Way.

[H3] Poisons, Acids, and Antidotes

Most poisons found on Tékumel need to be ingested to be effective. Only a small number (the venoms) can be used on weapons, and only one (Sagún spores) is effective when breathed in. Note that the inorganic and vegetable poisons can be bought from apothecaries and alchemists in major cities, though the various animal venoms are generally only available from assassin clans or official sources (such as the Azure Legion).

When a character takes damage from an attack with a poisoned weapon, touches an item smeared with contact poison, consumes poisoned food or drink, or is otherwise poisoned, he must make a Fortitude saving throw. If he fails, he takes the poison’s initial damage (usually ability damage). Even if he succeeds, he typically faces more damage 1 minute later, which he can also avoid with a successful Fortitude saving throw.

One dose of poison smeared on a weapon or some other object affects just a single target. A poisoned weapon or object retains its venom until the weapon scores a hit or the object is touched (unless the poison is wiped off before a target comes in contact with it).

Any poison smeared on an object or exposed to the elements in any way remains potent until it is touched or used.

Poisons can be divided into three basic types according to the method by which their effect is delivered, as follows.

**Ingested:** Ingested poisons are virtually impossible to utilize in a combat situation. A poisoner could administer a potion to an unconscious creature or attempt to dupe someone into drinking or eating something poisoned. Assassins and other characters tend to use ingested poisons outside of combat.

**Inhaled:** Inhaled poisons are usually contained in fragile vials or eggshells. They can be thrown as a ranged attack with a range increment of 3m. When it strikes a hard surface (or is struck hard), the container releases its poison. One dose spreads to fill the volume of a 3m cube. Each creature within the area must make a saving throw. (Holding one’s breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons; they affect the nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.)

**Injury:** This poison must be delivered through a wound. If a creature has sufficient damage reduction to avoid taking any damage from the attack, the poison does not affect it. Traps that cause damage from weapons, needles, and the like sometimes contain injury poisons.

The characteristics of poisons are summarized on X-X: Poison Costs and Effects. Terms on the table are defined below.

_Type:_ The poison’s method of delivery (contact, ingested, inhaled, or via an injury) and the Fortitude save DC to avoid the poison’s damage.

_Initial Damage:_ The damage the character takes immediately upon failing his saving throw against this poison. Ability damage is temporary.

_Secondary Damage:_ The amount of damage the character takes 1 minute after exposure as a result of the poisoning, if he fails a second saving throw. Unconsciousness lasts for 1d3 hours. Ability damage is temporary.

_Price:_ The cost of one dose (one vial) of the poison. It is not possible to use or apply poison in any quantity smaller than one dose.

### Perils of Using Poison

A character has a 5% chance of exposing himself to a poison whenever he applies it to a weapon or otherwise readies it for use. Additionally, a character who rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll with a poisoned weapon must make a DC 15 Reflex save or accidentally poison himself with the weapon.

Every creature within 1.5m of the point where the acid hits takes 1 point of acid damage from the splash.

[H3] Intermediate Technology

Items of Intermediate Technology are scarce, but have been created by unusually skilled, genius-level Tsolyáni crafters, rather than being examples of ancient technology or of magic. They are often assumed to be sorcerous, though.

The Games Master may permit a character (or group of characters) to start out with one of these items, if they have an appropriate background, but it should be costly.

[H4] Examples

[H5] The Far-Seer

The Far Seer was a squarish tube of black Tíu wood, its ends closed with glittering lenses of polished glass, glued into place with ochre Si’u gum … Zaren hi Murudu had developed the prototype at the Monastery of the Sapient Eye in the Chákan forests … Zaren was a rarity: a mechanical genius …Very few Tsolyáni — or any of the people of the Five Empires for that matter — were handy with machines. Sorcery was easier and more reliable!

— M.A.R. Barker, [ITALICS] Lords of Tsámra [/ITALICS]

This 8x magnification telescope is the only known example of its kind; presumably did not have a chance to build any more after making the prototype.

Game Mechanics: Magnifies distant objects or landscapes by eight times, providing a bonus to Spot checks (as determined by the GM). Easy to operate.

Resource Point Cost: 100

[H5] Fake Eyes

Eyes (see p. XX) are well known, and much feared, so there is some demand for high-quality fakes. These are available in most large cities, though those who make them do not advertise their services. A Fake Eye is visually indistinguishable from the real thing, at least without careful examination at touch range. Of course, it has no effect if the button is pushed.

Game Mechanics: A Fake Eye provides a +4 bonus to Intimidation checks.

Cost: 30 Resource Points

[H3] Magical Items

Sample magical items are included in the following section, with some background info, so that Games Masters can insert the items carefully into their campaigns.

[H4] Examples

[H5] Emerald of Hagárr of Paránta

Hagárr of Paránta was a notorious pirate and sorcerer, many thousand years ago. He created, or caused to be created, a small number of magical emeralds, which grant the holder the power to control sea creatures. Each emerald holds 100 charges, recharging one charge per day in sunlight. One charge allows the bearer one minute of total control of all non-sentient sea creatures within 20m.

Cost 300 Resource Points

[H5] Ladder of Mríddu the Magician

These magical ladders are famed in legends and tales, featuring in many daring escapades of yore. At least three are known of, though there may be more. Each Ladder of Mríddu is 17m long when fully extended, but is capable of being rapidly folded to a supernaturally small size and weight (a little less than the size of a human fist, with a weight of under 100g). It is, in effect, a sorcerous doorway to a pocket universe, in which most of the ladder is stored when folded.

Ladders of Mríddu are highly coveted, partly for their legendary associations and partly for their practical value to tomb robbers, assassins, spies, etc. Anyone seeing one in action is likely to remember it from the old tales (Knowledge: History check, DC 10).

Anyone frequently seen wielding a Ladder of Mríddu may begin to acquire a disreputable Reputation, at the GM's discretion.

If a sorcerer passes within 10m of a Ladder, the GM should make a Magic: Psychic check on the player's behalf (DC 15) to determine if the character detects the item.

Cost 150 Resource Points

[H3] High Technology: The Eyes

The best-known examples of ancient, high technology on Tékumel are the Eyes. These devices are small spheres of opaque, unknown material, around the size of a human eye and with an iris-like opening. The various types of Eye look more-or-less identical, until activated.

Some 50 percent of all Eyes have a tiny inscription on the back, written in one of the ancient languages. Eyes with no inscription must be tested - sometimes with unlooked-for results . Once the function of the device has been determined, the GM rolls percentile dice, and the score is the number of charges remaining in the Eye, i.e. the number of times it can be used before it becomes exhausted. Again, some 50 percent of all Eyes have a tiny dial just below their operating stud which indicates charges remaining; the figure shown changes each time the Eye is used . Other Eyes lack this convenience, and the referee must keep track both of his original secret roll and also the number of times the Eye is used.

There is a 5 percent chance that a given Eye will be defective, deteriorated over the long centuries of disuse .

If this is indicated, the GM rolls percentile dice again as follows: 1-50 = the Eye is now completely inactive,-

51-80 = the Eye has only half its indicated charges ; 81-90 = the device has an effect opposite to its normal purpose, or its effect is distorted in some way (referee's option); 91-100 = the Eye explodes, doing 4d6 damage to the user and 2d6 to any character within 3m!

If there is a way to recharge Eyes after use, this is certainly not widely known; most scholars would find it difficult to even open one up to examine it, without catastrophic consequences (successful DC 20 Knowledge: History _and_ successful DC 20 Craft: Jewelry checks to avoid the destruction of the eye in an explosion as per the previous paragraph).

Eyes were originally designed as tools, not weapons, so can be rather unwieldy. A character will have a -4 non-proficiency penalty when using an Eye, unless he or she has the Exotic Weapon Proficiency: Eye feat. The GM may wish to restrict acquisition of this feat to those who are willing to expend a large number of charges (4d6) with one or more Eyes in their possession.

Eyes often affect an area rather than an individual — targets may attempt a Reflex saving throw to dive out of the way. Eyes that affect individual victims usually require a Will or Fortitude save on the part of the target.

[H4] Examples

The following list is not exhaustive, and the GM may insert other types into the game as he or she sees fit. Also, the saving throws listed are typical ones – a particularly ancient or poorly made Eye may have a lower save, whereas an especially well-preserved or expertly fashioned Eye may have a higher one.

1 . The Abominable Eye of Detestation : This causes 1-12 beings to flee from the user in utter horror and revulsion. It is especially efficacious against undead (-2 penalty on the Will save). It has a range of 12m and a duration of 10 combat rounds. The victim is _frightened_ for the duration, unless she make a Will save (DC 20).

2. The Excellent Ruby Eye : This fairly common device gives the user the power to "freeze" 1d6 beings (Fortitude save negates) . The victim is frozen at the exact moment of time (for him) when he was struck, and no act, thought, etc. can be undertaken while under the influence of this Eye. Another charge of this device is needed to release a victim; no spell, etc. will succeed . This Eye has a range of 15m.

.3 . The Eye of Advancing Through Portals : This Eye projects a force which opens any door, blasts down a wall of rock up to 3m thick, and can create a tunnel 3m long and 1.5m wide through solid rock. It has a range of just 3m, and thus, though it may appear an ideal antipersonnel weapon (a person blasted with it is splashed all over the nearest wall; DC15 Reflex save negates), but the short range renders it a dangerous weapon at best .

4 . The Eye of Aerial Excellence : This permits the user and 1d12 companions or equivalent weight to fly up

to 9m per round for a maximum of 50 rounds per charge . Any comrades or objects picked up must be within a 1.5m radius of the user of this Eye. Any unwilling creature can avoid being picked up with a saving throw (DC 15 Will save negates).

5. The Eye of Allseeing Wonder : This Eye projects a 30cm diameter beam which reveals all invisible objects or

beings, dimensional doors, etc. in its path up to 50m away. It also serves as illumination in the dark. Each charge lasts 10 rounds.

6 . The Eye of Being an Unimpeachable Shield Against Foes : This Eye provides immunity from all bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing weapons (magical or not). Its effects last two turns (20 combat rounds), and up to 1d4 beings can be protected. It has no power against spells, Eyes, or other magical devices .

7. The Eye of Bestowing Life: This Eye immediately revivifies any being slain within the last three weeks. Any small fragment is enough for the Eye to act upon. No rest is necessary before returning to normal activity. There is a 10% chance for the resurrected character to permanently lose 1 point of Constitution. This Eye is rare.

8 . The Eye of Calling Forth an Unconquerable Army: This device contains a force of fighting automata, who can be called forth by expending a charge. These beings are retained by the Eye upon another dimensional plane. Treat them as 3rd level human Legionaries wearing the equivalent of heavy armor and carrying swords and shields (treat as chlén-hide). They remain on this plane for 2d10 combat rounds and then must return to the Eye. The number of automatons called forth on a given charge is determined by rolling percentile dice; there is always a maximum of 1-100 such beings, even if some have been slain previously . These automatons are fighters only and cannot obey other orders (e.g. open doors, search chests, stand guard).

9. The Eye of the Creeping Fog of Doom : This Eye produces a cloud of any gaseous element the user requires. Its settings were known only to the ancients, however, and most of these devices now produce poisonous gases (50 percent chance of inhaled poison gas, with a save of a random DC (2d6+6), initial damage 1 Con, secondary damage 1d8 Con; 40 percent chance of contact poison gas, save of 2d4+6, initial damage 1 Con, secondary damage 1d6 Con; 10 percent chance of some non-poisonous gas, such as oxygen). The cloud is blown out at a speed of 3m per round, and it covers an area 30m square. It lasts 6d10 rounds before dissipating . Beware of wind direction, since the gas can blow back and slay its sender . This Eye must not be used in a confined space either, since the gas requires room to roll out and spread.

10. The Eye of Departing in Safety: This device instantly transports 1d12 beings or equivalent weight to a

predetermined place . It is necessary to focus the Eye first upon the place to which one wishes to return; after this, it automatically carries its load back to that place. It has a maximum range of 100m, and if this Eye is used

without first determining the destination, it transports the user into illimitable darkness from whence there is no returning. Note that this Eye may also be"unset" by simply twisting the stud, if the user changes his or her mind and no longer wishes to be focused upon a previously selected location; this costs no charges.

[H5] Other items

These may be technology of another form or perhaps ‘magic’ instruments, though it should be remembered that any technology may be seen as magic. Power levels as follow- moderate[m], artifact[a] and eldritch [e]in increasing order. Eldritch should always be in cooperation with gm and player storytelling. [note that ‘lead feet’ or opportunities for bad things to happen while used have been applied]

1. the smooth stone. resembling a ‘worry stone’ these small disklike items fit in the hand and are rubbed smooth in the center. if a person with even a modicum of psychic ability rubs the stone while experiencing enough emotion, they will be transported to another place. some of the stones will even return you to your origin point. good luck. [m]
2. the book. these books are filled with glyphs that when used correctly will transport a person to another place and/or time. companions may come if they are touching it. the glyphs themselves possess the power, all one has to do is to follow the patterns correctly. unfortunately the ink and patterns do fade with use. good luck. [m]
3. the ring of the first founder. this item is a left over from the scouts who first landed on tekumel. they possess a limited ‘other dimensional space’ and some have a ‘demon’ within them that allows limited use as a weapon or secure storage facility. typically the person who wears one is healthier, and more alert with aging slowed or stopped. it is unknown if the demon is a computer [nanites in your body!] or not, whether or not the rings have been tampered with by those of the latter times, or even if the items are indeed from the first founder’s time. they just work. [a]
4. the sword of janule. rediscovered well before the death of the last emperor, this sword is purported to be the weapon of the entity that guarded lady avanthe at dormoron plain (as she would not usually fight physically herself). the sword served the empress janule in her rise to power and most recently was quietly readied should the civil war have unfortunate consequences. its powers are simple and brutal. activated only by a prayer to the goddess by a servant of avanthe or dlamelish, the sword takes over its bearer (using nanotech or some other means) and an aspect of the goddess moves forward to battle. a blue glow surrounds the wielder such that they cannot be harmed. things that may activate the sword include technology, fire, ksarul things, undead things, etc. if used on a servant of avanthe or dlamelish the sword becomes like unto swiss cheese and does not harm them. natural beings may be treated in this manner or the sword may be like chlen hide. the sword itself does not do significant damage past the ‘magical steel’ range, so things that are really powerful (I’ve seen it fight a 40’ long serpentine ru’un) are not necessarily harmed by it. good luck thinking a way out while the sword holds the enemy off. [gm may add other appropriate powers and miracles may happen – this item should be managed by close gm-player consultation][e]
