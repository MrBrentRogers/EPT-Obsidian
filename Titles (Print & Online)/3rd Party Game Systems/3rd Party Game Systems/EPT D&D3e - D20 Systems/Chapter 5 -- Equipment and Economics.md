[H1] Chapter 5: Equipment and Economics

[H2] Handling Money

The GM should determine the best way to handle finances in your _Tékumel d20_ campaign, probably in consultation with players. Many groups prefer not to have to keep track of every last hlásh that every character acquires or spends, though that approach can certainly work. For example in a low-status campaign that revolves around an economic and literal fight for survival, every hlásh really does count – so it makes sense to even count every qirgál, because it could make the difference as to whether or not the character eat that night. Likewise, in a campaign that revolves around a merchant clan's trading trips, it makes sense to keep close track of finances.

For a campaign that is more about high-status characters (who regard money and bills as somewhat beneath them, anyway), it may be best for the GM to simply allow each player to have access to whatever resources seem reasonable, based on their status and wealth (taking account of their Clan, and if they have it, the Wealthy feat). If they want access to especially high-cost items, those might need to be purchased through their clans, with the clan retaining ownership of it.

The Access to Clan Resources rules (p. XX) can be used as a middle ground, allowing the GM to assume that characters will have status-based expenses and status-based income that more-or-less balance out, at least while at home, but perhaps requiring the players to keep more careful track of coinage while on adventures.

[H2] Tsolyáni Currency

Though iron is rare, and thus, staggeringly valuable, on Tékumel, more terrestrially valuable metals are not quite so scarce. Thus, the currency is based around small coins of gold, silver, and copper. The gold coin is the 3-gram káitar. A káitar is worth 20 silver hlásh, with each hlásh worth 20 copper qirgál

[BEGIN CHART]

Coin Material Quantity per káitar

káitar gold 1

hlásh silver 20

qirgál copper 400

[END CHART]

Low Clan Tsolyáni may never even see a káitar up close, and rarely or never handle a single hlásh. On the other hand, High or Very High clanmembers actively prefer not to know about money, or precisely how wealthy they are, thinking that such concerns are beneath them. Thus, they may never see anything smaller than a káitar, and even regard such gold coins as rather vulgar. Such nobles expect their servants to deal with all financial matters.

Clanhouses offer banking facilities, and most Tsolyáni make use of them, rather than carrying a great deal of cash with them. For transporting large sums from one place to another, the practical solution is to either carry a draft from one's clanhouse treasury, or simply convert the cash to high-value, low-bulk gems, which can be resold on arrival.

[H2] Access to Clan Resources

All clanmembers, of however lowly a status in however lowly a clan, have access to equipment and other resources from their clan storehouses. A Tsolyáni's first thought, on realizing the need for a particular item, would not be "where can I buy it?" but "does my clan already own one that I could borrow?" Table X-X: Access to Purchases (page xxx) gives a good indication of what kind of things a character could get access to, depending on their starting Resource Points. A Wealthy character (see p. XX) comes from a richer clanhouse, and thus has access to more or better resources. Note that however wealthy or high-status one is, generally, a small, poor, rural clanhouse may simply not own the same resources as one's usual home clanhouse (though in most cases, the rural clanhouse administrators will try their hardest to fulfill any requests from such visiting nobles, for the sake of honor). Likewise, even a poor clanmember may be able to gain access to more resources than usual when visiting an especially rich clanhouse, even allowing for a certain amount of suspicion of the "poverty-stricken yokels" on the clanhouse administrators' part.

Access Value

If a character wishes to use clan resources, follow this procedure:

Take the item's worth in káitars

Divide this worth by the character's Resource Points. This determines the Access Value of the item.

If a character has a negative Reputation, an item's Access Value increases by one category for each level of negative Reputation. Conversely, a positive Reputation decreases the item's Access Value by one category per two levels. The GM can increase the category if a character has irregular finances, particularly if the clan quartermaster suspects them of keeping money back from the coffers. Likewise, if the character is in the clan elders' bad books for whatever reason, the Access Value category may increase.

[[ITALIC]]Example:

Elechu has 50 Resource Points. He needs a physician's bag (80 káitars). For Elechu, the physician's bag has an Access Value of 1.6 (80 ÷ 50 = 1.6). As this is between 1 and 2, he can have the bag, so long as he explains exactly what it is for, and agrees to return it after use. If he had one level of negative Reputation, he would effectively have an Access Value of 2 to 5, and thus would probably only get the physician's bag if on clan business (and would need to account for every bandage and ointment he used in the process).[[ITALIC]]

[BEGIN CHART]

Table X-X: Access to Purchases

Access Value Description of Access

up to 0.25 Unlimited personal use. You do not need permission for this item, and the quartermaster probably doesn't even make a note that you have taken one.

0.25 to 0.5 Near-unlimited personal use. Again, the quartermaster doesn't question you over your need for it, but might start to notice if you regularly started taking several of them.

0.5 to 1 Limited personal use. You would need to demonstrate a specific need for the item. The quartermaster probably wouldn't try too hard to verify the facts of your need, but would certainly take a note of your loan of the item, and would expect to see it back eventually, in good condition.

1 to 2 Very limited personal use. Again, you would need to prove a need for the item. The quartermaster will pay attention to your request, considering it carefully and possibly making specific investigations as to the veracity of your supposed need. You would be expected to return it as soon as your need was over, and might be given a specific time limit for its use. It would need to be returned promptly and in good condition.

2 to 5 Limited clan use. You would need to prove that not only did you need the item, but that your having it would provide a specific benefit to the clan. It must be returned intact as soon as your task is over, or as soon your task stops benefiting the clan.

5 to 10 Very limited clan use. This item will only be issued as part of a clan project, rather than a personal one. The clanmaster and clan elders must be aware of, and approve of, the project. It will be made clear to you that the clan retains full possession and ownership of the item at all times; you are not so much being loaned it, as being made temporary custodian of it for the good of the clan.

10+ GM's discretion only. Again, this would only be issued as part of a clan project, and the clan elders would want to ensure the PC was closely supervised throughout. If it is issued at all, it is unlikely to be issued to a single clan member; rather, an entire group must take responsibility for its safe and prompt return.

[END CHART]

Clans do vary in the equipment they have available, and will not, of course, be able to loan out anything they do not possess! Unusual or rare items, particularly magical or steel items, may be totally unavailable, unless the clan specializes in dealing with such things.

[H2] Income and Expenses

Most characters will have some kind of monthly income, and all will have regular monthly expenses, even if living in clan accommodation.

[H3] Income

Income varies according to character rank, skills, social status, and location.

Income and expense figures are listed in káitars, unless otherwise specified.

[H4] The Professions

Anyone with an official position, such as a government official or priest, will receive pay based on Circle Rank (or military rank, for those who are members of a Legion in any capacity). At lower ranks, these salaries are quite poor, but clans are often willing to assist characters in such positions, in the hope of later repayment in influence once the characters are of higher rank.

[H5] The Government

Government salaries are given in Table X-X, but can be considered a starting point, only. The figures given assume a large city; reduce by 10% for a smaller city or large town, or 25% for small-town or rural areas. A character who is willing to accept bribes may earn considerably more, depending on the precise nature of his or her work.

[H5] The Priesthood

Priest salaries are the same as those of government officials (again, refer to Table X-X), at least for Ritual Priests. Administrative Priests are paid a little more (+5%). Priests in Cohorts are paid less (-10%), and any other priests not listed above are also paid less (-5%). The priest salary scale does not apply to temple guards, who are paid according to their military rank (see Table X-X).

[END TABLE]

The salaries in Table X-X apply to members of Legions. Temple Guards are regarded as more prestigious, and so are paid more (+10%). Other guards and police are generally seen as less prestigious, being paid considerably less (10% less for Sákbe Road Guards, 15% less for Militia and Tomb Police, and 50% to 70% less for town or village constables, depending on the size and wealth of the settlement).

[H4] Clan Employment

Those who work for their clan are generally paid according to how skilled they are (measured in Skill Ranks), the status and perceived value of their profession (usually dependent on clan level), and the location he or she is working in.

Table X-X: Profession Salaries

Monthly Income by Skill Ranks (káitars)

High elite professional (Sorcerer's Bodyguard, Clanmaster) 7.5 15 25 50 100 200 400

The GM should feel free to adjust theses figures to between 50% and 200% of the values given in Table X-X, depending on the wealth and size of the clanhouse in question.

For Legionaries, use whichever is highest from the following: Attack Bonus (including Base Attack Bonus, plus the highest of Str and Dex bonus), Teamwork ranks, Knowledge: Military ranks.

For Guards, use whichever is highest from the following: Attack Bonus (including Base Attack Bonus, the highest of Str and Dex bonus), Knowledge: Religion ranks, Spot ranks.

[H5] Self-Employment

Those who are self-employed will find their income varying randomly each month, depending on the relative success or failure of their business at that point. Their base income is the same as that found in Table X-X: Profession Salaries. This is then modified based on a skill check (roll on Knowledge: Business, Knowledge: Nobility, or Appraise, whichever is highest). Refer the result of the skill check to Table X-X: Modified Income.

Check Result Modified Income

4 or less No income (-100%)

5 to 9 -70%

10 to 14 -30%

15 to 19 No modifier

20 to 24 +20%

25 to 29 +40%

30 to 35 +60%

Etc. Etc.

Merchants take even larger risks; do the same thing, but modify the result as follows:

Check Result Modified Income

4 or less No income; instead, you make a loss equivalent to 1d6 x 100% of your income. If you cannot pay, and your clan will not bail you out, you will be sold into slavery.

5 to 9 No income (-100%)

10 to 14 -50%

15 to 19 No modifier

20 to 24 +40%

25 to 29 +80%

30 to 35 +120%

Etc. Etc.

[H4] Investment

It is always possible for a character with surplus money to invest in business ventures, property, caravans, etc. Usually it is expected that they will invest this money in their clan's various enterprises, though this is certainly not a strict requirement.

Broadly, each investment opportunity can be divided into Low Risk, Medium Risk, and High Risk categories, whatever the nature of the business. Prior to investing, a character may make an Appraise check (DC 15) to determine how risky the venture is.

Each month, whichever character is managing the investment makes a Knowledge: Business skill check, then cross-checks the result with the riskiness of the business on Table X-X to determine how much is gained or lost that month.

Table X-X: Investment Results

Check Result Gain or Loss

Low Risk Medium Risk High Risk

4 or less No gain; you lose your initial stake, too, as a merchant venture goes bust or your clan makes a very poor business decision.

5 to 9 Loss of 10% Loss of 20% Loss of 30%

10 to 14 Loss of 5% Loss of 10% Loss of 15%

15 to 19 No gains or losses

20 to 24 Gain of 5% Gain of 10% Gain of 15%

25 to 29 Gain of 10% Gain of 20% Gain of 30%

30 to 35 Gain of 15% Gain of 30% Gain of 45%

Etc. Etc. Etc. Etc.

Of course, the GM may modify the check as appropriate. For example, characters who become directly or indirectly involved in a particular business venture (perhaps dealing with the bandits who have plagued the clan's caravan route for many months), the GM may give a significant bonus or penalty to the skill check.

[H3] Expenses

Every character will have a monthly expenses tally, based on food, dependents, staff, taxes, etc.

[H4] Basic Expenditures

Basic monthly expenses are worked out according to the character's income. Status is so vital in Tsolyánu society that characters will find their expenses increasing as their income does, just so that they can maintain the lifestyle expected of their status.

Most characters will live in clanhouses. Doing so costs 50% of income, to cover food, lodging, and other monthly expenses. It costs 45% if living in a barracks or temple situation, but 60% if living in private accommodation.

Merchants may subtract half their Haggle percentage (if any) from their living costs. A high-income character spends proportionately less on expenses (5% less for a monthly income over 100 káitars; 10% less if over 500 káitars).

Dependents increase expenses by 5% per spouse (assuming they are not working), or 1% per child under 12.

[H4] Income Tax

Assess a further 1% off all characters' incomes to account for income tax. Cheats are likely to be punished severely.

[H4] Servants and Slaves

Any character who has servants or slaves must pay further costs for them: wages for servants, or upkeep costs for slaves. Paid members of staff expect wages according to their skills and social class, as found on Table X-X: Clan Employment (see p. XX).

Slaves cost around 3% of their purchase price, every month, to keep them clothed, fed, and generally happy.

A servant or slave being underpaid will tend to perform poorly and grudgingly, or even leave (attempt escape, in the case of a slave), in extreme circumstances. Of course, a character wishing to reward or encourage exceptional service can always pay more.

[H2] Weights and Measures

_Tékumel d20_ uses the metric system. Tsolyánu weights and measures are a little different, and are provided here for additional flavor.

[END CHART]

[H2] Items and Prices

Prices here are in káitars, unless noted to the contrary. They are a guideline, based on average prices for average quality goods in typical marketplaces; the GM may alter them according to any unusual factors that may apply, such as the quality of an item (well-made or antique items costing 200% or more of the list price; badly made or second-hand items, as little as 50% less), local variations (for example, chlén-hide items may be cheaper in an area that has a great many chlén), etc.

As ever, Merchants may subtract their Haggle percentage, if any. A character wishing to spend a little time (10 minutes minimum) turning on the charm in the hope of a slight discount may make a Diplomacy check to get a discount (DC 20 for a 5% discount; DC 25 for 10%; a failure to meet at least DC 15 may mean the stallholder takes an active dislike to the character).

[H3] Weapons and Armour

Tékumel has very little iron. The need for something hard and durable to make into armor and weapons has led to the development of chlén-hide, from the chlén-beast. Thick layers of this hide can be harvested twice a year without injury to the chlén, then softened, carved, molded, and hardened. All the processes in turning chlén-hide into its hard, metal-like final form are secrets, guarded carefully by the tanner clans. Chlén-hide weapons and armor do not last so long as steel would, nor hold such a sharp edge, but they are significantly lighter (around 1/3 of the weight of an equivalent steel item). Chlén-hide may shatter in use, and are not repairable, so it is important to carry several spares even on a short campaign.

The Tsolyáni love of decoration means that chlén-hide is rarely seen in its dull greyish state, but is lacquered or painted in a variety of bright colors according to the owner's clan, religion, and personal style.

Steel weapons and armor are very scarce. The small quantities of iron found are soon bought up by rich, high-status temples or legions to turn into steel arms and armor for their own use, and are rarely available for purchase by private individuals.

All prices given in Table X-X assume chlén-hide (or, occasionally, bronze, which is in every way equivalent to chlén-hide in game terms). On rare occasions when steel items become available on the open market, they sell for at least 100 times as much as the equivalents in chlén-hide or bronze, even for the most corroded, rusted old iron sword. A well-made item, with a known history and a reputable manufacturer, could sell for up to 5,000 times as much as the chlén-hide or bronze equivalent.

Asterisked items are not usually made from steel, since non-metal equivalents are easily available and equally good. For example, bows, crossbows, and weapon shafts are generally better when made from wood.

[H4] Custom Weapons

Chlén-hide is easy to carve and mold prior to the hardening process, allowing Tsolyáni chlén-hide crafters to create quite unusual and exotic weaponry. See the Designing Special Items rules (p. XX) for more info.

[H4] Weapons and Armour for Non-humans

Non-human characters will need specially made weapons and armor, since human-made items will not fit or suit them (at least a -4 penalty on relevant rolls or checks, at the GM's discretion; some items may be simply unusable by some species). Specially made weapons are available at the listed price, so long as the non-human character goes to a crafter of his or her own species. Otherwise they will cost double.

NB: An incendiary fire-pot is essentially a primitive incendiary grenade. A thin-walled clay pot is filled with flammable materials, then lit before being thrown (or hurled in a staff-sling). Each pot weighs 2 kg.

[H4] Armour

Ordinary soldiers are usually issued with chlén-hide armor (typically low to middling quality, depending on the legion or temple), but may purchase better quality armor if desired. Even units that possess steel armor do not issue it to soldiers except when immediate battlefield use is anticipated, since it is so scarce and valuable. An officer of Heréksa rank or higher is expected to buy his or her own suit of armor.

The hot climate makes long-term armor use uncomfortable and potentially even dangerous (heat exhaustion is a real risk, particularly for characters in heavy steel armor, so characters not expecting imminent danger tend not to wear it. Dress uniforms are typically made to resemble armor, but offer little or no actual protection (see Clothing, p. XX, for prices for this ceremonial "armor"). Civilians do not tend to wear armor unless their profession is violent or dangerous.

Off-duty priests wear civilian outfits appropriate to their class and status. Lay priests can borrow such outfits from the temple as necessary.

5,000 Priest of Circles 11-up: More fancy ritual robes incorporating braiding, complex patterns, lush fabrics, precious metal, etc. Again, priests will need suitable civilian clothing too. In the unlikely event that a lay priest would need such garb, she could borrow it from the temple.

250 Soldier, Tirrikámu to Kási: Ceremonial uniform and armor. Soldiers will also need civilian wear appropriate to their class. Characters who are only loosely attached to legions, or who are in legions that rarely need ceremonial armor, may simply be able to borrow a suit from the legion as necessary.

5,000 Soldier, Dritlán or above: Ceremonial uniform and armor. These will be made from precious metals, or at least shiny and fancy materials.

[END CHART]

[H4] Individual Garments

Those non-humans who do not wear clothing, but use straps, baldrics, webbing, harnesses etc. to carry equipment, can buy such items for around 1-10 káitars in most big cities.

[BEGIN CHART]

[H4] Ceremonial Forms of Dress

Ceremonial dress comes in a variety of ever-more-elaborate versions depending on the status and position of the character. Each Form has a very specific style of ceremonial dress, which can be purchased at a cost of 1000 káitars per rank or character level.

[H3] Precious Metals, Gems, and Jewellery

Jewelry on Tékumel has similar uses to elsewhere, in that it can be a display of personal status and social class, or a useful, portable form of wealth. It is also favored for giving gifts and bribes of all kinds, being seen as far more appropriate than hard currency.

To determine the value of an item of jewelry, take the basic cost of the metals and gems involved, then add the labor costs of having goldsmiths and gemcutters work on the piece (typically adding 20% to 200% of the original cost, again, depending on the complexity and skill involved). If it is to be bought retail, the merchant may add another fee on top (anything from 20% to 50% or even more). An antique piece may be slightly or considerably more valuable (another +10% to +1,000% added to the cost, depending on provenance, fame of jeweler, quality, and era).

[H4] Metal Ingots

Metal ingots may also be used as currency.

[H4] Gems

A beautiful array of gemstones can be found on Tékumel. Table X-X: Gem Costs lists types of gem with typical prices for 1-carat stones. A flawed or discolored stone may be worth only 70% to 90% of the value given, while a perfect gem might be worth twice as much.

Note that for stones categorized as "precious" or above, significantly larger gems cost significantly more, due to their rarity. As a guideline, multiply the base price by the square of the number of carats; for example, a 7-carat black pearl (usual cost for 1 carat = 60 káitars) will cost 60 x 7 x 7 = 2,940 káitars. This does not apply to the cheaper stones, which can generally be found in larger pieces.

The prices given are for uncut gems. A cut stone will be worth at least twice as much, depending on the quality of the workmanship.

[H4] Complete Meals

These costs include a fee for preparation, and so represent a meal at a hostel or prepared by a food-oriented clan. Characters who prefer to make their own meals can do so at half the listed cost.

[H4] Beverages

Non-alcoholic drinks are usually sold by the mug (around 0.6 liters), whereas alcoholic drinks are sold by the bottle (2.7 liters).

[BEGIN CHART]

Table X-X: Beverage Costs

Article Price Particulars

A'ásh 3 káitars This is a rough, grain-based alcohol, popular among the lower classes. It is commonly found in Úrmish and Katalál. The most powerful blend is known as Jékw, and is produced in Yán Koryáni.

Chumétl 16 qirgáls This is non-alcoholic beverage of savory Hmélu buttermilk is drunk by every social class throughout Tsolyánu, Yán Kór, Salarvyá, and Mu’ugalavyá. It is salted and heavily spiced, with the precise recipe varying enormously depending on region and social class. Ahoggyá hate it.

Dátsu 6 káitars This robust dlél-fruit brandy is purple-red in color. The Kráa Hills varieties are particularly prized, as are vintages from northeast of Khéiris in Mu’ugalavyá, or the Nuférsh and Kakársh regions in Livyánu. A high-quality bottle might cost 50-100 káitars.

Drónu 12 káitar Drónu is a dark-colored dessert wine made from urtsé berries. A top-quality bottle from Koylúga or Jaekánta could cost up to 100 káitars.

Faóz 6 hlásh This simple rice beer is common in Livyáni, particularly among the working class, but rarely found elsewhere.

Héngka 5 hlásh This wheat or dná beer is found everywhere, but usually regarded as suitable only for commoners. Héngka can be used as a generic term to refer to other relatively weak alcoholic drinks.

Lás 2 qirgáls Lás is an infusion of tíu tree leaves, favored in the north and northeast, and drunk hot. Some add milk, sugar, or salt, depending on region and personal taste.

Másh 10 káitars This is another brandy, though generally better-regarded than dátsu. It is sweet and gold-colored, with a delicate yet exotic flavor. A bottle of the best could cost 100-500 káitars.

Ngálu 5 káitars Ngálu is a common wine, found in all the Five Empires and the surrounding area. A top-quality bottle from a particularly favored vintage could cost 50 káitars or more.

Tsuhóridu 90 káitars This is any one of a variety of swamp liqueurs, made from the crushed seeds of ferns. As well as the usual alcoholic effects, many varieties of tsuhóridu can have other properties, thanks to strange compounds in the seeds, including addiction, hallucination, partial paralysis, paranoia, heightened sexual urges, etc. A particularly fine quality tsuhóridu could cost as much as 1,000 káitars per bottle, but would more usually be sold in tiny cups.

Tuór 24 qirgáls This is a sweet, sherbet-like drink beloved in Livyánu and some regions of Mu’ugalavyá, where it is drunk by all classes of society, with the most expensive varieties (up to 50 káitars for a small cup) being flavored with exotic herbs and spices.

[END CHART]

[H4] Drugs

The common social drugs of Tsolyánu and nearby are typically consumed in clanhouses, or occasionally in public premises hosted by clans specializing in preparing drugs and herbs. Typical prices per kilogram are given on Table X-X: Drug Costs, though these prices may vary: a person buying only a few grams for personal use will of course pay proportionately more, and costs per kilogram can be considerably lower if drugs are bought in the regions they are produced.

Pygmy Folk and Hláka are affected by the listed drugs in the same manner as humans. For most other non-humans, these drugs have no particular effects, though Shén are badly affected by Chümaz (which is a dangerous poison for them) and Ntó (which turns them psychotically angry).

Inevitably, some of the non-human species have their own drugs, such as Fssá roots for Shén and mmuókh bark for Páchi Léi.

[H3] Buildings and Land

It is normal in the Five Empires to live in one's clanhouse, or perhaps in one's quarters at a temple or barracks if a priest or soldier, though occasionally individuals will wish to buy or rent more private accommodation.

[INSERT EXAMPLES OF TSOLYANI BUILDING LAYOUTS]

[H4] Buildings (Rental)

It can be difficult to find suitable buildings for rental, since the practice is relatively unusual. Assume a 25% chance per week of finding an appropriate dwelling for rent. This can be increased to 30% by hiring a merátokoi agent (fee = 50% of the monthly rental, once found).

Table X-X gives monthly rents for various dwellings, assuming a location within the walls of a large city. Reduce the figures by 25% for a small city or town, and by 40% for a village or rural area.

[BEGIN CHART]

19 Medium-sized house or shop: four or so rooms, plus a stone courtyard, bathroom, and kitchen; possibly a small garden; stone or tiled floors.

125 Large house or shop: as above, but with around a dozen rooms. Some rooms may be rented out to subtenants, who cannot usually be evicted due to the vagaries of Tsolyáni law.

500 Minor mansion or small clanhouse: a fancier version of the above, with perhaps two dozen main rooms plus servants' quarters. It may have either an attached garden, orchard, summerhouse, and/or roof garden, depending on the availability of land in the area.

1500 Major mansion, minor palace, or large clanhouse: a still more complex and elaborate version of the above, with around 80 rooms plus servants' quarters, various gardens and minor outbuildings, workshops, storehouses, etc.

12,000 Major palace, or extremely large clanhouse: as above but comprising several main buildings containing hundreds of rooms, house temple, impressive gardens, several outbuildings, etc.

[END CHART]

[H4] Buildings: Construction and Purchase

Costs and time needed to erect an edifice of one's own are adjudged by the GM. The availability of

workers and materials, the location (city, suburban, rural, or wilderness), the willingness of the Imperium to

have such a building at that location, etc. must all be taken into consideration; it is unusual for the Imperium or clans to sell land to private individuals, too. An engineer-architect is required for any building project, and permission to build must be obtained at the Palace of the Realm nearest the site at a cost of 2d6 x 1000 áitars. If older buildings are to be torn down to make way for the new construction, the permission of the Imperium is mandatory: the usual cost of 2d6 x 1000 áitars, plus 2d6 x 1000 áitars in bribes. As an example, a smallish palace could be constructed in a vacant urban area of Jakalla for about 100,000 áitars (plus the costs mentioned above). A fortified mansion would cost 150,000-200,000 in the same place, though it is illegal to fortify private dwellings without Imperial permission (at least 4d6 x 1000 áitars in bribes, unless there is a genuine need). These buildings would cost about 75,000 and 125,000 áitars respectively if built in the suburban areas outside Jakalla's walls, and they would be still cheaper in a rural area, if stone quarries were nearby, and if there were a sufficient labor force in the neighborhood. A small stone castle might be built in the mountains north of Boy Sy for about 250,000 áitars, while the same fortress in the jungles of Cháka would cost double this sum, due to the lack of stone nearby and the paucity of laborers. Buying an existing mansion, palace, or fortress is somewhat cheaper and easier to do. There is around a 30% chance per month of a suitable building becoming available, at a purchase price anywhere from 50,000 to 600,000 áitars, depending upon the building's size, richness of design and furnishings, proximity to the mansions of important personages, etc. A building outside Jakalla would cost less, and one in a rural area still less, and purchase prices will go down similarly. Ruined buildings can also be restored, once the land is purchased or rented from its present owners, or obtained in fief from the Imperium . In certain areas where the central government is weak, occasional ruined fortresses and other buildings may be found which can simply be taken by "squatter's rights" and rebuilt. Costs, rentals, etc . must be judged by the GM, since it is impossible to give a hard and fast rule. Money can be borrowed from the moneylenders to be found at the Palace of the Realm in any large city. A Diplomacy check (base DC 15) will govern the lender's willingness to loan the money, at a monthly interest rate of 2d6%. Such loans must be paid back within three months (the usual time, under ánlaw); otherwise the debtor will be seized and sold as a slave.

Once acquired as slaves or employees by a player, the statistics and operation of the nonplayer character are turned over to his control, and he or she is expected to maintain the nonplayer character, pay for his or her

needs, and keep his or her record sheet. The Imperial slave markets contain those miserable persons who have lost face with their clans, debtors and indigents, minor criminals (spared by some whimsically lenient judge), miscellaneous foreigners, and a few nonhumans .

[H3] Assassination Gear

Assassination gear cannot readily be purchased on the open market, so prices are not listed. These items can generally only be acquired through Assassin Clans or specialist Imperial units.

[H4] Collar of Forever

A garrotte, made from copper wire (or less often from plant fibers), for stealthy sentry elimination. Requires Exotic Weapon Proficiency: Garrotte.

[H4] Deliverer from Existence

This is a flat throwing knife, often carried in sets. The name can be given to any throwing knife, though the assassin's version is typically designed to be disguised and concealed inside another object, such as a scroll case or part of a suit of ceremonial armor. Requires Martial Weapon Proficiency.

[H4] Pa’iya’s Kiss

A Pa’iya’s Kiss is a glass bottle with a handle, designed to be thrown and thus deliver a poison, corrosive fluid, incendiary powders, etc. It can be thrown (Martial Weapon Proficiency) or hurled in a sling (Simple Weapon Proficiency).

[H4] Summoner upon the Way

This is a small pistol-grip crossbow, usually used to shoot poison darts. Requires Exotic Weapon Proficiency: Summoner upon the Way.

[H3] Poisons, Acids, and Antidotes

Most poisons found on Tékumel need to be ingested to be effective. Only a small number (the venoms) can be used on weapons, and only one (Sagún spores) is effective when breathed in. Note that the inorganic and vegetable poisons can be bought from apothecaries and alchemists in major cities, though the various animal venoms are generally only available from assassin clans or official sources (such as the Azure Legion).

When a character takes damage from an attack with a poisoned weapon, touches an item smeared with contact poison, consumes poisoned food or drink, or is otherwise poisoned, he must make a Fortitude saving throw. If he fails, he takes the poison’s initial damage (usually ability damage). Even if he succeeds, he typically faces more damage 1 minute later, which he can also avoid with a successful Fortitude saving throw.

One dose of poison smeared on a weapon or some other object affects just a single target. A poisoned weapon or object retains its venom until the weapon scores a hit or the object is touched (unless the poison is wiped off before a target comes in contact with it).

Any poison smeared on an object or exposed to the elements in any way remains potent until it is touched or used.

Poisons can be divided into three basic types according to the method by which their effect is delivered, as follows.

**Ingested:** Ingested poisons are virtually impossible to utilize in a combat situation. A poisoner could administer a potion to an unconscious creature or attempt to dupe someone into drinking or eating something poisoned. Assassins and other characters tend to use ingested poisons outside of combat.

**Inhaled:** Inhaled poisons are usually contained in fragile vials or eggshells. They can be thrown as a ranged attack with a range increment of 3m. When it strikes a hard surface (or is struck hard), the container releases its poison. One dose spreads to fill the volume of a 3m cube. Each creature within the area must make a saving throw. (Holding one’s breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons; they affect the nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.)

**Injury:** This poison must be delivered through a wound. If a creature has sufficient damage reduction to avoid taking any damage from the attack, the poison does not affect it. Traps that cause damage from weapons, needles, and the like sometimes contain injury poisons.

The characteristics of poisons are summarized on X-X: Poison Costs and Effects. Terms on the table are defined below.

_Type:_ The poison’s method of delivery (contact, ingested, inhaled, or via an injury) and the Fortitude save DC to avoid the poison’s damage.

_Initial Damage:_ The damage the character takes immediately upon failing his saving throw against this poison. Ability damage is temporary.

_Secondary Damage:_ The amount of damage the character takes 1 minute after exposure as a result of the poisoning, if he fails a second saving throw. Unconsciousness lasts for 1d3 hours. Ability damage is temporary.

_Price:_ The cost of one dose (one vial) of the poison. It is not possible to use or apply poison in any quantity smaller than one dose.

### Perils of Using Poison

A character has a 5% chance of exposing himself to a poison whenever he applies it to a weapon or otherwise readies it for use. Additionally, a character who rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll with a poisoned weapon must make a DC 15 Reflex save or accidentally poison himself with the weapon.

Every creature within 1.5m of the point where the acid hits takes 1 point of acid damage from the splash.

[H3] Intermediate Technology

Items of Intermediate Technology are scarce, but have been created by unusually skilled, genius-level Tsolyáni crafters, rather than being examples of ancient technology or of magic. They are often assumed to be sorcerous, though.

The Games Master may permit a character (or group of characters) to start out with one of these items, if they have an appropriate background, but it should be costly.

[H4] Examples

[H5] The Far-Seer

The Far Seer was a squarish tube of black Tíu wood, its ends closed with glittering lenses of polished glass, glued into place with ochre Si’u gum … Zaren hi Murudu had developed the prototype at the Monastery of the Sapient Eye in the Chákan forests … Zaren was a rarity: a mechanical genius …Very few Tsolyáni — or any of the people of the Five Empires for that matter — were handy with machines. Sorcery was easier and more reliable!

— M.A.R. Barker, [ITALICS] Lords of Tsámra [/ITALICS]

This 8x magnification telescope is the only known example of its kind; presumably did not have a chance to build any more after making the prototype.

Game Mechanics: Magnifies distant objects or landscapes by eight times, providing a bonus to Spot checks (as determined by the GM). Easy to operate.

Resource Point Cost: 100

[H5] Fake Eyes

Eyes (see p. XX) are well known, and much feared, so there is some demand for high-quality fakes. These are available in most large cities, though those who make them do not advertise their services. A Fake Eye is visually indistinguishable from the real thing, at least without careful examination at touch range. Of course, it has no effect if the button is pushed.

Game Mechanics: A Fake Eye provides a +4 bonus to Intimidation checks.

Cost: 30 Resource Points

[H3] Magical Items

Sample magical items are included in the following section, with some background info, so that Games Masters can insert the items carefully into their campaigns.

[H4] Examples

[H5] Emerald of Hagárr of Paránta

Hagárr of Paránta was a notorious pirate and sorcerer, many thousand years ago. He created, or caused to be created, a small number of magical emeralds, which grant the holder the power to control sea creatures. Each emerald holds 100 charges, recharging one charge per day in sunlight. One charge allows the bearer one minute of total control of all non-sentient sea creatures within 20m.

Cost 300 Resource Points

[H5] Ladder of Mríddu the Magician

These magical ladders are famed in legends and tales, featuring in many daring escapades of yore. At least three are known of, though there may be more. Each Ladder of Mríddu is 17m long when fully extended, but is capable of being rapidly folded to a supernaturally small size and weight (a little less than the size of a human fist, with a weight of under 100g). It is, in effect, a sorcerous doorway to a pocket universe, in which most of the ladder is stored when folded.

Ladders of Mríddu are highly coveted, partly for their legendary associations and partly for their practical value to tomb robbers, assassins, spies, etc. Anyone seeing one in action is likely to remember it from the old tales (Knowledge: History check, DC 10).

Anyone frequently seen wielding a Ladder of Mríddu may begin to acquire a disreputable Reputation, at the GM's discretion.

If a sorcerer passes within 10m of a Ladder, the GM should make a Magic: Psychic check on the player's behalf (DC 15) to determine if the character detects the item.

[H3] High Technology: The Eyes

The best-known examples of ancient, high technology on Tékumel are the Eyes. These devices are small spheres of opaque, unknown material, around the size of a human eye and with an iris-like opening. The various types of Eye look more-or-less identical, until activated.

Some 50 percent of all Eyes have a tiny inscription on the back, written in one of the ancient languages. Eyes with no inscription must be tested - sometimes with unlooked-for results . Once the function of the device has been determined, the GM rolls percentile dice, and the score is the number of charges remaining in the Eye, i.e. the number of times it can be used before it becomes exhausted. Again, some 50 percent of all Eyes have a tiny dial just below their operating stud which indicates charges remaining; the figure shown changes each time the Eye is used . Other Eyes lack this convenience, and the referee must keep track both of his original secret roll and also the number of times the Eye is used.

There is a 5 percent chance that a given Eye will be defective, deteriorated over the long centuries of disuse .

If this is indicated, the GM rolls percentile dice again as follows: 1-50 = the Eye is now completely inactive,-

51-80 = the Eye has only half its indicated charges ; 81-90 = the device has an effect opposite to its normal purpose, or its effect is distorted in some way (referee's option); 91-100 = the Eye explodes, doing 4d6 damage to the user and 2d6 to any character within 3m!

If there is a way to recharge Eyes after use, this is certainly not widely known; most scholars would find it difficult to even open one up to examine it, without catastrophic consequences (successful DC 20 Knowledge: History _and_ successful DC 20 Craft: Jewelry checks to avoid the destruction of the eye in an explosion as per the previous paragraph).

Eyes were originally designed as tools, not weapons, so can be rather unwieldy. A character will have a -4 non-proficiency penalty when using an Eye, unless he or she has the Exotic Weapon Proficiency: Eye feat. The GM may wish to restrict acquisition of this feat to those who are willing to expend a large number of charges (4d6) with one or more Eyes in their possession.

Eyes often affect an area rather than an individual — targets may attempt a Reflex saving throw to dive out of the way. Eyes that affect individual victims usually require a Will or Fortitude save on the part of the target.

[H4] Examples

The following list is not exhaustive, and the GM may insert other types into the game as he or she sees fit. Also, the saving throws listed are typical ones – a particularly ancient or poorly made Eye may have a lower save, whereas an especially well-preserved or expertly fashioned Eye may have a higher one.

1 . The Abominable Eye of Detestation : This causes 1-12 beings to flee from the user in utter horror and revulsion. It is especially efficacious against undead (-2 penalty on the Will save). It has a range of 12m and a duration of 10 combat rounds. The victim is _frightened_ for the duration, unless she make a Will save (DC 20).

2. The Excellent Ruby Eye : This fairly common device gives the user the power to "freeze" 1d6 beings (Fortitude save negates) . The victim is frozen at the exact moment of time (for him) when he was struck, and no act, thought, etc. can be undertaken while under the influence of this Eye. Another charge of this device is needed to release a victim; no spell, etc. will succeed . This Eye has a range of 15m.

.3 . The Eye of Advancing Through Portals : This Eye projects a force which opens any door, blasts down a wall of rock up to 3m thick, and can create a tunnel 3m long and 1.5m wide through solid rock. It has a range of just 3m, and thus, though it may appear an ideal antipersonnel weapon (a person blasted with it is splashed all over the nearest wall; DC15 Reflex save negates), but the short range renders it a dangerous weapon at best .

4 . The Eye of Aerial Excellence : This permits the user and 1d12 companions or equivalent weight to fly up

to 9m per round for a maximum of 50 rounds per charge . Any comrades or objects picked up must be within a 1.5m radius of the user of this Eye. Any unwilling creature can avoid being picked up with a saving throw (DC 15 Will save negates).

5. The Eye of Allseeing Wonder : This Eye projects a 30cm diameter beam which reveals all invisible objects or

beings, dimensional doors, etc. in its path up to 50m away. It also serves as illumination in the dark. Each charge lasts 10 rounds.

6 . The Eye of Being an Unimpeachable Shield Against Foes : This Eye provides immunity from all bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing weapons (magical or not). Its effects last two turns (20 combat rounds), and up to 1d4 beings can be protected. It has no power against spells, Eyes, or other magical devices .

7. The Eye of Bestowing Life: This Eye immediately revivifies any being slain within the last three weeks. Any small fragment is enough for the Eye to act upon. No rest is necessary before returning to normal activity. There is a 10% chance for the resurrected character to permanently lose 1 point of Constitution. This Eye is rare.

8 . The Eye of Calling Forth an Unconquerable Army: This device contains a force of fighting automata, who can be called forth by expending a charge. These beings are retained by the Eye upon another dimensional plane. Treat them as 3rd level human Legionaries wearing the equivalent of heavy armor and carrying swords and shields (treat as chlén-hide). They remain on this plane for 2d10 combat rounds and then must return to the Eye. The number of automatons called forth on a given charge is determined by rolling percentile dice; there is always a maximum of 1-100 such beings, even if some have been slain previously . These automatons are fighters only and cannot obey other orders (e.g. open doors, search chests, stand guard).

9. The Eye of the Creeping Fog of Doom : This Eye produces a cloud of any gaseous element the user requires. Its settings were known only to the ancients, however, and most of these devices now produce poisonous gases (50 percent chance of inhaled poison gas, with a save of a random DC (2d6+6), initial damage 1 Con, secondary damage 1d8 Con; 40 percent chance of contact poison gas, save of 2d4+6, initial damage 1 Con, secondary damage 1d6 Con; 10 percent chance of some non-poisonous gas, such as oxygen). The cloud is blown out at a speed of 3m per round, and it covers an area 30m square. It lasts 6d10 rounds before dissipating . Beware of wind direction, since the gas can blow back and slay its sender . This Eye must not be used in a confined space either, since the gas requires room to roll out and spread.

10. The Eye of Departing in Safety: This device instantly transports 1d12 beings or equivalent weight to a

predetermined place . It is necessary to focus the Eye first upon the place to which one wishes to return; after this, it automatically carries its load back to that place. It has a maximum range of 100m, and if this Eye is used

without first determining the destination, it transports the user into illimitable darkness from whence there is no returning. Note that this Eye may also be"unset" by simply twisting the stud, if the user changes his or her mind and no longer wishes to be focused upon a previously selected location; this costs no charges.
