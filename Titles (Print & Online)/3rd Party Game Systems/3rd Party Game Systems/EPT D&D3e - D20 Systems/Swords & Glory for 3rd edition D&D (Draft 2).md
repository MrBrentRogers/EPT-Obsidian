**Copyright notice:**  These materials utilise Professor M. A. R. Barker's creation of the World of Tekumel but are not to be considered 'authentic Tekumel' and are in no way 'approved' by Professor Barker.  This work is made using the d20 system.

This conversion, like Sammy Grimes' _Empire of the Petal Throne_ (EPT) conversion, gives D&D 3e rules for gaming in the wonderful world of Tekumel ([http://www.tekumel.com/](http://www.tekumel.com/)).  Unlike the EPT conversion, this one tries to follow the guidelines presented in later Tekumel rules sets such as _Swords & Glory_ (1983-85), often abbreviated as S&G, and _Gardasiyal_ (1992-94).  These games are more complex than EPT in some ways, and characters in these games are less powerful than characters in EPT.

# General Philosophy

D&D creates heroic, larger than life characters: as we well know, high level characters can leap off tall cliffs, take on armies, and perform the most amazing feats.  A 9th level character who chooses to ignore the laws of the land has little to fear from the local constabulary.  It does not fit the S&G feel to have small parties challenge entire legions and win.  Thus, the characters created by these rules, although still formidable, are not quite as powerful as standard D&D characters.

# Abilities

Ability scores are rolled using the standard method for PCs.  Two optional scores, _Pedhetl_ and _Comeliness_, may be added if a group wishes, and are rolled in the same manner as other scores.  If Pedhetl is used, it is used in place of Charisma to calculate spell bonuses for sorcerers (see below).  If Comeliness is used, its modifier applies to any interactions with characters who would find your character handsome or beautiful; generally, this means that Comeliness does not affect interactions between characters of different races.

# Races

In the traits given below, the number in parentheses by Charisma applies only to calculating spell casting abilities.  If you are using the Pedhetl score, the number in parentheses is a modifier to Pedhetl; if there is no number in parentheses, apply the Charisma modifier to Pedhetl as well.  
    Non-human characters generally start out clanless.  Some, such as Pe Choi, have little trouble getting into a clan, possibly even a medium clan; others will be very lucky to enter a clan of any status.

Human Racial Traits:  
Humans are by far the most common race on Tekumel.  The Five Empires--Livyanu, Mu'ugalavya, Tsolyanu, Yan Kor, and Salarvya--are ruled by humans, and most of the smaller nations are formed and ruled by humans.  Except for the N'lüss they conform to the standard rules for creating humans in the _Player's Handbook_.  Optionally, female characters may be given a +2 to Dexterity and one spell casting prerequisite (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma) for a -2 to Strength.

# Classes

As described above, characters on Tekumel are generally somewhat less powerful than their standard D&D counterparts.  
 - Aristocrat (Mrígnu): As described in the 3e DMG, p. 38.
  
- Aristocrats must be human and in a High, Very High or Imperial clan.  
 - Barbarian (Faltérikh): As described in the 3e PHB, pp. 24-26, except that Tekumelani barbarians do not have the Rage or Damage Reduction abilities.
  
- Characters who begin as barbarians are clanless until adopted by a clan.  
 - Expert (Gámra): As described in the 3e DMG, p. 39.  Many Administrative and Ritual priests are experts.
  
- Experts must be in a Medium, Low or Very Low clan.  
 - Fighter (Púrdalmokoi): As described in the 3e PHB, pp. 35-37, except that their Hit Die is d8.  Fighters are specialists in one-on-one combat, and are thus usually gladiators of low clans, although a few nobles might pick up a level or two of fighter if their lives are adventurous.
  
- Fighters can come from a clan of any status, but if they start as fighters, they must be in a Medium, Low or Very Low clan.  
 - Monk (Dedaratlkói if they follow Stability or Hu'onkói if they follow Change): As described in the 3e PHB, pp. 37-41, except that Tekumelani monks gain no supernatural or spell-like abilities.
  
- Monks can come from a clan of any status.  
 - Sorcerer: As described in the 3e PHB, pp. 48-52, except that they cannot have familiars.
  
- Sorcerers can come from a clan of any status, but the requirements are strict: a sorcerer's Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma (or Pedhetl, if it is used) must each be at least 19 minus her clan level (see below).  
 - Shaman (Bálash): As the sorcerer, except that shamans have a different spell list and a barbarian's skill selection.
  
- Characters who begin as shamans are clanless until adopted by a clan.  
 - Warrior (Changadésha): As described in the 3e DMG, p. 39, except that Tekumelani warriors can take Weapon Specialization as a feat and have exclusive access to the Soldiering skill (see below).  Warriors are soldiers, best trained in large scale combat.
  
- Warriors can come from a clan of any status.

There is no priest class; priests may be of any class except barbarian or shaman, and may be of any clan level, including clanless (cf. _Man of Gold_).  Note that a priest's Circle is not equal to his class level, and the two may not even be very well correlated.

Multiclass characters must obey all clan restrictions for each of their classes.  For example, an aristocrat cannot take any levels of barbarian, expert or shaman.  Characters who start as barbarians or shamans can not advance in those classes if they take levels of any other classes and remain in 'civilized' areas.  Sorcerers rarely take levels in another class.

**Race and character class:** There are limitations to the level a non-human character may attain in the Five Empires, depending on their character class.  Tsolyani society seems to have very few non-humans in positions of real power.  For example, it seems logical that Pe Choi or Tinaliya sorcerers should be able to reach greater power than humans, yet Tsolyani attitudes and the generally insular non-human mindsets limit such things.  Non-humans have unlimited advancement in their homelands.  The table below indicates the limits to advancement by character class for non-humans:  
 

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Race**|**Warrior / Expert**|**Sorcerer / Monk**|
|N'luss|11|0|
|Ahoggya|11|0|
|Hlaka|11|0|
|Pachi Lei|11|11|
|Pe Choi|11|11|
|Pygmy Folk|8|11|
|Shen|11|5|
|Swamp Folk|11|0|
|Tinaliya|8|11|
|Urunen|11|11|

# Clans

Clan names and descriptions can be found at [http://Tekumel.com/game_images/downloads/player.zip](http://Tekumel.com/game_images/downloads/player.zip).  Clans are divided into levels as follows:  
 

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Imperial|6|
|Very High|5|
|High|4|
|Medium|3|
|Low|2|
|Very Low|1|
|Clanless|0|

Characters get +1 to all influencing NPC attitude checks (pg. 149, 3e PHB) per level of clan difference when dealing with others of lower clans and -1 per level of clan difference when dealing with others of higher clans.  There is also a -2 modifier (in both directions) when dealing with someone from another country (or even another region sometimes--e.g., a Vriddi of Fasiltum talking to a grandee of Jakalla).  
    Characters may expect shelter from fellow clan members in other Tsolyani cities.  They also receive an income from their clan; see _Swords & Glory, Vol. II_ or _Adventures on Tekumel, Part One_, p. 18.

# Skills

D&D's skill system is more coarse-grained than the _Swords & Glory_ skill system.  Thus, for example, all Ritual priest skills would be grouped under Knowledge (Religion) and Knowledge (The Many Planes).  
    Some D&D skills do not exist on Tekumel.  For example, the Ride skill does not exist, since there are no suitable riding creatures to be found on the continent.  The Pick Pocket skill is also unavailable--Tsolyani thieves generally have short, miserable lives.  
    Characters can only acquire ranks in Knowledge for Arcana, Religion, Architecture, Geography (High Cartography on Tekumel), the Many Planes or History under temple tutelage.  In addition, there is an Ancient Devices field for the Knowledge skill, giving those who possess it clues to the function and operation of ancient technological devices.  Some sample DCs are given below:  
 

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Task**|**DC**|
|Use an Eye|10|
|Read an charge indicator that isn't labeled in a modern language|24|
|Fly an aircar|28|
|Operate a Lightning Bringer|30|
|Fly a spaceship|60|
|Repair a spaceship|80|

Warriors have exclusive access to the following skill:

**Soldiering (Int; Trained Only)**  
    This skill represents a character's military training: his ability to march and attack in formation, to understand military history, and so on.  Each rank gained in Soldiering corresponds to one step in soldier skills in _Adventures on Tekumel, Part One_, p. 34.

    Finally, if you wish, you can retain the S&G skill system for nonwarrior skills; costs should be changed to 1 point per rank for all skills.

# Feats

Access to the special spells of the temples is only granted to sorcerers in good standing.  The following feats describe these milestones in a sorcerer's career:

**Generic Magic**  
You can cast the Generic spells of your temple.  
    **Prerequisites:** Spellcaster level 1+.  
    **Benefit:** As described above.

**Temple Magic**  
You can cast the Temple spells of your temple.  
    **Prerequisites:** Spellcaster level 10+.  
    **Benefit:** As described above.

Shamans must take similar feats to gain access to Generic and Shaman spells, respectively.  
    Although most magical knowledge is in the hands of the temples (see below), a few spells are given to characters by a friendly sorcerer (invariably for a good reason) or passed down within a clan or lineage as a jealously guarded secret.  The following feat describes this rare occurrence.

**Cast Spell (Special)**  
You know one spell.  
    **Prerequisites:** No spellcaster levels, sufficient Charisma and sufficient Intelligence or Wisdom to cast the spell, and you must be as high in level as a sorcerer who could cast the spell.  
    **Benefit:** You know one spell and can cast it as a sorcerer or shaman of your level (including the number of times per day).  Flashy combat spells can _not_ be selected--more than one Temple would hunt an uninitiated character to his death if he knew Doomkill!  In addition, use of the spell should invariably be subtle, particularly if it is a Generic or Temple spell, as it is a dangerous secret to possess.  Your DM will need to approve any spell you wish to possess, and you (or the DM) should have a good in-game reason why your character possesses such knowledge.

# Money and Equipment

Money in Tsolyánu is based on the Káitar, a gold coin weighing approximately 3 grams and roughly equal in value to the standard D&D gold piece.  The coin system is base 20 (instead of base 10) so multiply prices in silver by x2 to find the cost in silver Hlásh and multiply prices in copper by x4 to find the cost in copper Qirgál (there are no platinum coins).  Items made of Iron cost more (see below)  
 

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
||**Káitar**|**Hlásh**|**Qirgál**|
|**Káitar**|1|20|400|
|**Hlásh**|1/20|1|20|
|**Qirgál**|1/400|1/20|1|

**Chlén-hide:**  Weapons and armor made of Chlén-hide are specially treated to make them almost as hard as bronze.  Chlén-hide weapons are -1 to hit and -1 to damage.  Chlén-hide armor has -2 armor protection, but has -10% spell failure, maximum Dexterity bonus is increased by 2, and armor check penalties are increased by 3.  Cost is normal.  
**Ordinary Steel:**  No modifiers, cost is x400 normal  
**Excellent Steel:**  Armor has +1 AC bonus, weapons have +1 hit and damage, cost x1000 normal  
**Enchanted Steel:**  Armor has +2 AC bonus, weapons have +2 hit and damage, cost x2500 normal

Holy water, alchemical devices such as thunderstones, repeating crossbows, lances, spiked chains and thieves' tools are not available.

# Combat

To better reflect the lethal nature of Tekumelani combat, the following variant rules should be used: Instant Kill (3e DMG, p. 64), Critical Misses (ibid., p. 65), Clobbered (ibid., p. 66), Death from Massive Damage Based on Size (ibid., p. 66) and Damage to Specific Areas (ibid., p. 66-67).

# Magic

First, some general notes about magic on Tekumel.  Although sorcery is not dependent on the gods for it to work, the temples are the main sources of learning how to do it.  Those priests who choose to specialize in sorcery are called "sorcerer-priests".  Those who learn sorcery but choose to be somewhat aloof from their temple are called "lay-priests" or "jack-priests".  Sorcerers are only taught those spells known to their temple (and the body of spells common to all temples).   Temple sorcery is a tightly guarded secret, and those that betray those secrets can expect to be hunted down and executed in the most horrible fashion imaginable.  Even scrolls of temple spells are enchanted so that only worshippers of the same deity (or his/her cohort) may use it.  If a person wishes to abandon their faith and join another temple, their memory is wiped so that they cannot remember their spells, and they must start over as 1st level sorcerers or shamans.  Notice that there are some spells common to all temples; these are not kept secret because everybody already knows them.  
    Tekumelani spells are of two types: _psychic_, which require no casting components and are cast purely by will, and _ritual_, which have both verbal and somatic components.  The minimum Wisdom to cast a psychic spell is 10 + the spell's level, and the minimum Intelligence to cast a ritual spell is 10 + the spell's level.  Both types of spells are arcane.  Tekumelani sorcerers and shamans gain bonus spells based on their charisma (or pedhetl, if you use that score).  There is no "magic" script.  Spells are studied and learned using ordinary languages.  The "Read Magic" spell is no longer necessary.  
    There are no metamagic or item creation feats on Tekumel, nor is countermagic possible.  
    Contact with metal grounds the use of both psychic and ritual magic (though this has no effect once the spell is cast).  For every gram of metal in contact with the caster there is a base 1% chance of failure (in addition to normal Arcane Failure checks), and if such a spell fails, the caster has a 50% chance of dying.  Because of this spellcasters avoid carrying metal arms and armor and tend to avoid even carrying coins, making use of gems or letters of credit instead.

# Conversion Tables

**Magic:** Some groups may wish to retain the S&G magic system. If so, sorcerers and shamans gain 25 spell points to buy spells each time they go up a level.  The following conversion tables will be useful in translating S&G spells to D&D mechanics:
