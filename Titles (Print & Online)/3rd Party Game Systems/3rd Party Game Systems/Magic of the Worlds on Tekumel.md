Introduction

The purpose of this is to list and compare all Tekumel spells, as well as other game system spells. This is done for the purpose of reviewing the spells and being able to incorporate the spells, sometimes just in name, into other game systems.

The root and meaning of the spell name, as well as any other information, when and if I can.

Besides Tekumel game systems, there will be inclusions for:

Dungeons & Dragons Edition 3.5 (Wizards of the Coast, 2003)

Spells in Alphabetical Order

## Acceleration (Haste)

Word Origin: Latin

(noun) increase in the rate or speed of something

### Slow/Haste (Barker M. , 1987, p. 24)

510. Descriptions of Bonus Spells\Group II\ 14. Slow/haste

### 27. Acceleration (P)* BE, HN, KA, VI (Barker & Cauley, 1994, p. 16)

G8: Gives the target triple speed. This affects movement speed and combat actions. Dexterity is tripled for purposes of initiative only. Spell casting cannot be accelerated: Only one spell can be cast per Round. Range: 15ft; Duration 2mins.

### 3.27.1 Acceleration (Tekumel Spell Lists, 2009)

Temples: Belkh´anu and Q´on, Hn´alla and Dr´a, Karak´an and Cheg´arra, Vim´uhla and Chit´eng  
Level: 5  
School: Transmutation  
Prerequisites: None  
Components: None  
Casting Time: Standard action  
Range: Fifteen feet  
Target: One creature  
Duration: Concentration, up to two minutes  
The target’s movement speed is tripled, they may make an attack as a swift  
action, and a full attack only requires a standard action. When rolling for  
initiative, the target gets a +3 bonus due to their speed.

Haste (Dungeons & Dragons Players Handbook 3.5 Edition, 2003, p. 239)  
Transmutation  
Level: Brd 3, Sor/Wiz 3  
Components: V, S, M  
Casting Time: 1 standard action  
Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
Targets: One creature/level, no two of  
which can be more than 30 ft. apart  
Duration: 1 round/level  
Saving Throw: Fortitude negates (harmless)  
Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)  
The transmuted creatures move and act more quickly than normal. This extra speed has several effects. When making a full attack action, a hasted creature may make one extra attack with any weapon he is holding. The attack is made using the creature’s full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. (This effect is not cumulative with similar effects, such as that provided by a weapon of speed, nor does it actually grant an extra action, so you can’t use it to cast a second spell or otherwise take an extra action in the round.)  
A hasted creature gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves. Any condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes you lose dodge bonuses.  
All of the hasted creature’s modes of movement (including land movement, burrow, climb, fly, and swim) increase by 30 feet, to a maximum of twice the subject’s normal speed using that form of movement. This increase counts as an enhancement bonus, and it affects the creature’s jumping distance as normal for increased speed.  
Multiple haste effects don’t stack. Haste dispels and counters slow.  
Material Component: A shaving of licorice root.

Haste (D&D Players Handbook 5th Edition, 2014, p. 250)  
3rd-level transmutation  
Casting Time: 1 action  
Range: 30 feet  
Components: V, S, M (a shaving of licorice root)  
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute  
Choose a willing creature that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the target’s speed is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to AC, it has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action.  
When the spell ends, the target can’t move or take actions until after its next turn, as a wave of lethargy  
sweeps over it.

## Acclimatisation

**Acclimatization**  

(Verb) (UK also acclimatisation; US also acclimation) is the process in which an individual organism adjusts to a gradual change in its environment (such as a change in temperature, humidity, photoperiod, or pH), allowing it to maintain performance across a range of environmental conditions.

You can change the target’s altitude by up to 20 feet in either direction on your turn. If you are the target, you can move up or down as part of your move. Otherwise, you can use your action to move the target, which must remain within the spell’s range.

### Neutralize Poison (Wizards of the Coast, 2003)

:Immunizes subject against poison, detoxifies venom in or on subject.

Conjuration (Healing)  
Level: Brd 4, Clr 4, Drd 3, Pal 4, Rgr 3  
Components: V, S, M/DF  
Casting Time: 1 standard action  
Range: Touch  
Target: Creature or object of up to 1 cu. ft./level touched  
Duration: 10 min./level  
Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless, object)  
Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless, object)  
You detoxify any sort of venom in the creature or object touched. A poisoned creature suffers no additional effects from the poison, and any temporary effects are ended, but the spell does not reverse instantaneous effects, such as hit point damage, temporary ability damage, or effects that don’t go away on their own. For example, if a poison has dealt 3 points of Constitution damage to a character and threatens to deal more damage later, this spell prevents the future damage but does not repair the damage already done.

The creature is immune to any poison it is exposed to during the duration of the spell. Unlike with _delay poison_, such effects aren’t postponed until after the duration —the creature need not make any saves against poison effects applied to it during  
the length of the spell.  
This spell can instead neutralize the poison in a poisonous creature or object for the duration of the spell, at the caster’s  
option.  
_Arcane Material Component:_ A bit of charcoal.

The target has 3 Combat Rounds (3 round or 18 seconds) to hide behind a magical or physical barrier before the spell arrives. If unable to do this, he must make a Saving Throw. Fail means they are transported to the Antechamber of the Blue Room, beyond which mighty Ksarul lies in his eternal, enforced sleep. If a devotee of Ksarul, Gruganu, or one of the foreign Ksarul-related deities is stuck by the spell (and this must be done accidentally), they will be returned unharmed to the location and time from whence he came. If the caster attempts to send the same target to the Blue Room twice, the caster is slain. One who does not worship the Doomed Prince or one of the associated deities is killed by the attendants of the Blue Room unless they make a Save at -10. Since the body is not on Tekumel, no revivification is possible. This spell affects only human-sized intelligent beings. Range: 90 ft; Preparation: 1 CR (1 round).

T8: As above, but 1-6 multiple targets are seized. These have 2 CR (2 rounds) to avoid the attack; a failed Save sends them to the Antechamber. Diameter: 10 ft; Range: 180 ft; Preperation: 1 CR (1 round).

A faint disturbance appears in the air in front of the caster and moves towards  
the target. If the target cannot get themselves behind a magical or physical

Will saving throw. If the target fails the saving throw, they are transported  
to the Antechamber of the Blue Room, beyond which mighty Ks´arul lies in his  
eternal, enforced sleep.  
Devotees of Ks´arul, Grug´anu, or one of the foreign Ks´arul-related deities  
struck by this spell accidentally are immediately returned unharmed to the  
location and time from whence they came, and a second attempt by the caster  
to send the target to the Blue Room results in the caster being slain instantly.  
Targets that do not worship the Doomed Prince or one of the associated deities  
are killed by the attendants of the Blue Room unless they make a Reflex saving  
throw, in which case they manage to throw themselves into the Unending Grey.

### Detect Thoughts (Wizards of the Coast, 2014, p. 231)

_2nd-level divination_  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S, M (a copper piece)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute  
For the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain creatures. When you cast the spell and as your action on each turn until the spell ends, you can focus your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn’t speak any language, the creature is unaffected.

You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature—what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature’s mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into ts reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that loom s large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.

Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell  
is particularly effective as part of an interrogation. You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can’t see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you.

You can’t detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn’t speak any language.  
Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as  
described above, even if you can’t see it, but it must still be within range.

### Rary’s Telepathic Bond (Wizards of the Coast, 2014, p. 270)

_5th-level divination (ritual)_  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (pieces of eggshell from two  
different kinds of creatures)  
**Duration:** 1 hour  
You forge a telepathic link among up to eight willing creatures of your choice within range, psychically linking each creature to all the others for the duration. Creatures with Intelligence scores of 2 or less aren’t affected by this spell.

Until the spell ends, the targets can communicate telepathically through the bond whether or not they have  
a common language. The communication is possible over any distance, though it can’t extend to other planes of existence.

### Telepathy (Wizards of the Coast, 2014, p. 281)

8 _th-level evocation_  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Unlimited  
**Components:** V, S, M (a pair of linked silver rings)  
**Duration:** 24 hours  
You create a telepathic link between yourself and a willing creature with which you are familiar. The creature can be anywhere on the same plane of existence as you. The spell ends if you or the target are no longer on the same plane.

Until the spell ends, you and the target can instantaneously share words, images, sounds, and other sensory messages with one another through the link, and the target recognizes you as the creature it is communicating with. The spell enables a creature with an Intelligence score of at least 1 to understand the meaning of your words and take in the scope of any sensory messages you send to it.

Duration: Instantaneous  
The caster removes the target’s spirit-soul, leaving the victim a mindless shell.

T5 to insert the persona of a deceased individual. Only Perceptions of the  
Energies G2 can detect this transfer, and Disenchantment U10 is required to  
remove the new inhabitant and restore the original. If cast out of a body in  
this manner, a dead person’s soul can never again be contacted. If the caster is  
driven out of a body, they either return to their original body if possible, or are  
destroyed. The caster’s body will perish in days if not cared for.

Casting Time: 1 standard action  
Range: Personal or touch  
Target: You or a creature or object weighing no more than 100 lb./level  
Duration: 1 min./level (D)  
Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless) or Will negates (harmless, object)  
Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless) or Yes (harmless, object)  
The creature or object touched becomes invisible, vanishing from sight, even from darkvision. If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too. If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so.  
Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible, such as a trailing rope.  
Of course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as stepping in a puddle). The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. (Exactly who is a foe  
depends on the invisible character’s perceptions.) Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear. Spells such as bless that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area.  
See Table 8–5: Attack Roll Modifiers and Table 8–6: Armor Class Modifiers, page 151, for the effects of invisibility on combat.  
Invisibility can be made permanent (on objects only) with a permanency spell.

### Animate Dead (Wizards of the Coast, 2014)

_3rd-level necromancy_  
**Casting Time:** 1 minute  
**Range:** 10 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a drop of blood, a piece of flesh, and a pinch of bone dust)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  
This spell creates an undead servant. Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of a Medium or Sm all humanoid within range. Your spell imbues the target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an undead creature. The target becomes a skeleton if you chose bones or a zombie if you chose a corpse (the DM has the creature’s game statistics).  
On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally com m and any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can com m and any or all of them at the sam e time, issuing the sam e com m and to each one). You decide what action the creature will take  
and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general com m and, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no com m ands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.  
The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any com m and you’ve given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again before the current 24-hour period ends. This use o f the spell reasserts your control over up to four creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating a new one.  
_A t Higher Levels._ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you animate or reassert control over two additional undead creatures for each  
slot level above 3rd. Each of the creatures must com efrom a different corpse or pile of bones.

Casting Time: 1 hour  
Range: Touch  
Components: V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 500 gp,  
which the spell consumes)  
Duration: Instantaneous  
You return a dead creature you touch to life, provided that it has been dead no longer than 10 days. If the  
creature’s soul is both willing and at liberty to rejoin the body, the creature returns to life with 1 hit point.  
This spell also neutralizes any poisons and cures nonmagical diseases that affected the creature at the  
time it died. This spell doesn’t, however, remove magical diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these aren’t first  
removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when the creature returns to life. The spell can’t return an  
undead creature to life.  
This spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn’t restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking  
body parts or organs integral for its survival—its head, for instance—the spell automatically fails.  
Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a - 4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and  
ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.

Duration: Instantaneous  
You touch a dead creature that has been dead for no more than a century, that didn’t die of old age, and that  
isn’t undead. If its soul is free and willing, the target returns to life with all its hit points.  
This spell neutralizes any poisons and cures normal diseases afflicting the creature when it died. It doesn’t,  
however, remove magical diseases, curses, and the like; if such effects aren't removed prior to casting the spell,  
they afflict the target on its return to life.  
This spell closes all mortal wounds and restores any missing body parts.  
Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a - 4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and  
ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.  
Casting this spell to restore life to a creature that has been dead for one year or longer taxes you greatly. Until you finish a long rest, you can’t cast spells again, and you have disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability checks,  
and saving throws.

is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed upon entering the area. You can exclude one or more of those  
types of creatures from this effect.

Second, you can bind an extra effect to the area. Choose the effect from the following list, or choose an  
effect offered by the DM. S om e of these effects apply to creatures in the area; you can designate whether the  
effect applies to all creatures, creatures that follow a specific deity or leader, or creatures of a specific sort,  
such as ores or trolls. When a creature that would be affected enters the spell’s area for the first time on a  
turn or starts its turn there, it can make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature ignores the  
extra effect until it leaves the area.

**_Courage._** Affected creatures can’t be frightened while in the area.

**_Darkness._** Darkness fills the area. Normal light, as well as magical light created by spells of a lower  
level than the slot you used to cast this spell, can’t illuminate the area.

except for bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.

U5: Hurls a net of tangling webs; if a target is affected, he loses 1-2 T (12mins) struggling to get free. A Dexterity Test at the “Harder” level is allowed once every other Combat Round to extricate oneself from these webs. Range: 30ft; Diameter: 10ft

### Web (Wizards of the Coast, 2003, p. 301)

Conjuration (Creation)  
Level: Sor/Wiz 2  
Components: V, S, M  
Casting Time: 1 standard action  
Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)  
Effect: Webs in a 20-ft.-radius spread  
Duration: 10 min./level (D)  
Saving Throw: Reflex negates; see text  
Spell Resistance: No  
Web creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands. These strands trap those caught in them. The strands are similar to spider webs but far larger and tougher. These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points—floor and ceiling, opposite walls, or the like—or else the web collapses upon  
itself and disappears. Creatures caught within a web become entangled among the gluey fibers. Attacking a creature in a web won’t cause you to become entangled.  
Anyone in the effect’s area when the spell is cast must make a Reflex save. If this save succeeds, the creature is entangled, but not prevented from moving, though moving is more difficult than normal for being entangled (see below). If the save fails, the creature is entangled and can’t move from its space, but can break loose by spending 1 round and making a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 25 Escape Artist check. Once loose (either by making the initial Reflex save or a later Strength check or Escape Artist check), a creature remains entangled, but may move through the web very slowly. Each round devoted to moving allows the creature to make a new Strength check or Escape Artist check. The creature moves 5 feet for each full 5 points by which the check result exceeds 10.  
If you have at least 5 feet of web between you and an opponent, it provides cover. If you have at least 20 feet of web  
between you, it provides total cover (see Cover, page 150).  
The strands of a web spell are flammable. A magic flaming sword can slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cobwebs. Any fire—a torch, burning oil, a flaming sword, and so forth—can set the webs alight and burn away 5 square feet in 1 round. All creatures within flaming webs take 2d4 points of fire damage from the flames.  
Web can be made permanent with a permanency spell. A permanent web that is damaged (but not destroyed) regrows in 10 minutes.  
Material Component: A bit of spider web.

### Web (Wizards of the Coast, 2014, p. 287)

2nd-level conjuration  
Casting Time: 1 action  
Range: 60 feet  
Components: V, S, M (a bit of spider web)  
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour  
You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice within range. The webs fill a 20-foot cube from that point for the duration. The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure their area.  
If the webs aren’t anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered  
over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.  
Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a Dexterity  
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.  
A creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained.  
The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire  
damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.
