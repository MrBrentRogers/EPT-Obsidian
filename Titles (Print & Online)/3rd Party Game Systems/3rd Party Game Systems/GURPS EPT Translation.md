**Empire of the Petal Throne to GURPS Translation**

[**http://www.weirdrealm.swifthost.net/gurps/gurpsept.html**](http://www.weirdrealm.swifthost.net/gurps/gurpsept.html)

**Experience**

Since starting characters in GURPS have 100 points, a first level EPT PC starts with that amount. But a "normal" person in GURPS is 25 points, so 1st level EPT NPCs start at that number of points. The following table shows the points given for various EPT levels:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**EPT Level**|**GURPS PC Points**|**GURPS NPC Points**|
|1|100|25|
|2|105|30 (+5)|
|3|110|35|
|4|115|40|
|5|120|45|
|6|125|50|
|7|130|55|
|8|140|65 (+10)|
|9|150|75|
|10|160|85|
||...||

Players should design their characters at 100 points and then spend the extra points as if they received them during play. This way any increases in the basic attributes will cost double and they won't be able to take 150 points of physical advantages.

**Attributes**

The following table shows the equivalent EPT Basic Talents and GURPS Attributes:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**EPT Basic Talent**|**GURPS Attribute**|
|Strength|ST|
|Dexterity|DX|
|Intelligence|IQ|
|Constitution|HT|

Since Empire of the Petal Throne uses randomly rolled Basic Talents, the levels of GURPS ST, DX, IQ and HT given below are guidelines, and therefore optional. Character points must still be spent normally. Since there are no attributes in GURPS for Comeliness and Psychic Ability, these EPT attributes translate into the GURPS Appearance advantages/disadvantages and Magery, respectively (see tables below).

When choosing basic attributes for the converted character keep the relative ratios approximately the same. If the character's Strength was higher than his Intelligence as a EPT character it should be higher as a GURPS character as well. The primary idea is to capture the same feeling in the character. The following tables work well as numbers with which to start. Adjust them as needed.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**EPT Basic Talent**|**GURPS Attribute**|
|1|3|
|2|4|
|3-5|5|
|6-9|6|
|10-16|7|
|17-26|8|
|27-38|9|
|39-50|10|
|51-62|11|
|63-74|12|
|75-84|13|
|85-91|14|
|92-95|15|
|96-98|16|
|99|17|
|100|18|

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**EPT Comeliness**|**GURPS Appearance**|
|01-10 Hideous|Hideous|
|11-20 Ugly|Ugly|
|21-30 Average|Unattractive|
|31-50 Average|Average|
|51-70 Goodlooking|Attractive|
|71-80 Very Goodlooking|Attractive, +1 Charisma|
|81-90 Handsome / Beautiful|Handsome|
|91-95 Very Handsome / Very Beautiful|Very Beautiful|
|96-00 Wildly Handsome / Gloriously Beautiful|Very Beautiful, +5 Charisma|

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**EPT Psychic Ability**|**GURPS Magery**|
|01-20 Non-Psychic|none|
|21-40 Barely Psychic|none|
|41-60 Average Psychic|none|
|61-80 Somewhat Psychic|Magery 1|
|81-95 Quite Psychic|Magery 2|
|96-00 Highly Psychic|Magery 3|

**Example**

Using the above charts, a 6th level Str 93, Dex 77, Int 35, Con 65, Psy 39, Com 45 EPT warrior might be ST 15, DX 13, IQ 9, HT 12 in GURPS with no Magery and Average appearance. This would cost 100 character points which would require the character to take some disadvantages to afford advantages and skills. Once the initial design is done, award the extra 25 points for having been a 6th level EPT character.

**Money**

The various coinage in EPT and GURPS breaks down as follows:

EPT Money : 400 copper Qirgal = 20 silver Hlash = 1 gold Kaitar.  
GURPS Money : 100 copper = $20 = 1 gold.

Convert EPT money into silver Hlash, then Hlash = GURPS $. GURPS wealth advantages and disadvantages will need to be taken, if starting wealth (including possessions) is above or below $1000. See Wealth table below:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**EPT Wealth**|**GURPS Wealth**|
|< 10 Kaitars|Dead Broke|
|10-24 Kaitars|Poor|
|25-49 Kaitars|Struggling|
|50-99 Kaitars|Average|
|100-249 Kaitars|Comfortable|
|250-999 Kaitars|Wealthy|
|1000-4999 Kaitars|Very Wealthy|
|5000-49,999 Kaitars|Filthy Rich|
|Each additional x10|+1 level of Multimillionaire|

**Skills**

Converting skills is relatively easy. Pick the GURPS equivalents of the desired EPT skills and add a few more from the GURPS list. Some of the EPT skills are multiple skills in GURPS (EPT assassin-spy-tracker becomes Stealth, Tracking, Shadowing, Poison, etc.).

**Spells**

Converting spells is relatively difficult. If you try to pick the GURPS equivalents of a number of EPT spells it may turn out that you need to know a hundred spells (or more!) to meet all the prerequisite requirements. Pick out the major spells that have close equivalents and take all their prerequisites.
