**The Concordat is an agreement between the 20 major religions agreeing to avoid civil war. It does not cover the Pariah Deities (She Who Must Not Be Named, The One, and The One Other) whose aim is to destroy all existence. It is generally assumed that people from the Five Empires worship the same group of “gods” and their “cohorts” (Pavar “discovered” a total of 20) under different names and levels of understanding. Everyone assumes they have a clearer picture than those “poor, ignorant heathen from [insert country other than your own here]”.

# Appendix B: More About Clans and Related Topics

**_1) Clans: I'd like to know more about the clans - their internal structure, typical and extreme sizes, the number of clans, political and religious allegiances, major characters, alliances etc._**

This is probably more detail than you need to explore initially, but here are some thoughts: Clans are generally collections of families of a similar faith and trade. This varies from clan-to-clan, with the more powerful clans holding more strictly to their identities (the Golden Bough clan, for instance, is a conservative Stability clan, meaning its members are generally Hnalla, Thumis or Avanthe worshippers of high status), while the lower clans are less rigid: the Black Mat clan which weaves sleeping mats, for instance. There are members of the Golden Bough clan who have gone on to worship the Change gods Chiteng or Hrihiyal, but they are definitely "black sheep" (or "black hma" as the case may be). The Black Mat clan has no time for such niceties: "Just weave yer accursed mat and shut up!"

**_2) A random thought on transport - does Tekumel have the wheel? Are carts and rickshaw-type conveyances common? What about carried litters? Or do people tend to walk everywhere?_**

Well, the problem is that Tekumel has the wheel, but they don't have a decent draft animal. Horses don't exist, and _Hmelu_ and _Chlen_ move about as fast as a hippo, so although carts are common they are of limited use. Carried litters are very* common, but rickshaws haven't been figured out. And remember, if your players decide to introduce such a thing, that the various litter-bearing, litter-building, and transportation clans would strive very hard to prevent the success of the venture. They have their livelihoods to maintain, and no they're not interested in any newfangled ideas, thank you.

**_3) Did S&G extend the character classes into other professions, and what sort of roles do they occupy in Tsolyani life? What I want here is a feel for how things like theft, assassination, spying, etc. are carried on. I can easily, I guess work something out from a mediaeval Japanese basis but I'm not sure how true that would be to the background of the world. Then again, perhaps basic things like human nature transcend culture._**

There are few thieves -- their penalty is death, and not even the honorable death of impalement. Spying is commonplace, and is not practiced by a "spy" profession -- the temple of Ksarul is made up either of spies or time-servers, and any high-level party (say a Governor's Ball) will be comprised entirely of people trying to get the goods on each other. These will be bureaucrats, politicians, clan elders, etc., all spying like mad.

Assassination is VERY touchy: honor -- the concepts of _lan_ and _bussan_ (honorable and dishonorable acts) is very important, and assassination is a dishonorable way to kill someone. Therefore, assassins are rare. Each major temple (say a BIG temple in a MAJOR city, like the temple of Hnalla in Usenanu) will have a house assassin, but he will rarely be employed, because once he acts he will hunted down and killed by the two assassin clans. They are the Dark Fear clan, located in the Chakan forests on the west border of Tsolyanu, and the Black Y clan, which is a secret and pervasive clan. These are the only two clans for whom assassination is an honorable act. Unfortunately you must be born into these clans in order to become a clan assassin, and not even Professor Barker knows enough about these clans to say what their internal society is like. Thus an assassin character would be difficult to play. And to be found in possession of assassin's weapons -- a Springing Doom or a Sender Upon the Way -- is also a death penalty.

**_4) Back to clans again - there are hints in the rulebook of clans based on professional ties as well as blood ones. Do clans have a different basis at different social levels?_**

As explained above, clans are collections of families, generally with both religious and professional identities. These identities vary greatly: some clans are "religious clans" (my own Cloak of Azure Gems), while others are "professional clans" -- various mercantile clans pay only lip-service to a religious faith. And again, the richer you are, the better a show you have to put on. The poorer you are, the less anyone cares.

**_5) Social ranks - are there any distinguishing marks used to differentiate people of different social ranks, like caste marks in India?_**

Not strictly: the nation of _Livyanu_ to the southwest uses tattoos called _aomuz_ to specify caste and rank and religion and shoe size and wine preference, in a pattern and code which has never been interpreted by any other nation except that the more one has the more important one seems to be. This is due in large part to the fact that the nation is very secretive -- you cannot travel in Livyanu outside the Foreigner's Quarters (more like a Foreigner's Compound) without an encyclopedic collection of authorization papers. If you try, the all-encompassing _Vru'uneb_ (secret police) will definitely catch you and kill you.

_Tsolyanu_ has no such coding. The only distinctions are subcultural: the _Vriddi_ are proud and arrogant with a distinctive beak-like nose (what would be called a "Roman nose"). They are _Vimuhla_ worshippers and delight in tracing their lineage back 20,000 years to the Empire of Engsvan la Gánga, which gets boring after a while but is their basis to claim that THEY ought to be running the Empire. (Do NOT point out to them that if they were so clever then why'd half of it get sunk in the ocean. They HATE that.) Other such cultural hallmarks exist, but are not of major import.

**_6) Religion - what sort of relationships exist between the different cults? Are there formal allegiances between any of them? Do they have things like monasteries? Any idea what sort of day-to-day rituals exist?_**

Uhm, please: "cults"? You don't call them cults. Very bad. There are no "formal" inter-religious allegiances, save the brief ones which lead to short-term mutual advantage and they dissolve when the first person blinks. Yes, Stability and Change temples tend to keep to themselves, but there are enough similarities of interest that you will occasionally see _Ksarul_ working with _Hnalla_ or _Avanthe_ with _Hru'u_. Not often, though.

There are* monasteries, but they tend to be hard to find. There is a _Hnalla_ monastery in the mountains southeast of _Sunraya_, a _Vimuhla_ monastery west of _Tumissa_, and a _Thumis_ monastery out there somewhere. These are not collections of chaste sophants moaning litanies to the gods (well, maybe in _Thumis'_ case), but are centers of power for the temples, magical research, and respite from the political melting pot of the empire proper. Part of the reason these monasteries are hard to find is because they are generally on side-planes and are only anchored to these physical locations tenuously. I've been to the _Thumis_ monastery twice and have yet to determine where its physical location might be.

**_7) "Adani" - how difficult is it for a woman to declare herself "adani", to be accepted as such and to maintain this status? (This might be relevant to a character in the planned campaign.)_**

That's _Aridani_. To become _Aridani_ is not difficult, except that maybe your clan might have other plans for you (marry you off to some land-baron or something). Barring unusual circumstances, you simply visit your local office of the Imperium (located near the governor's mansion or an office of the Omnipotent Azure Legion [the _Tsolyani_ Imperial police]) and declare yourself _Aridani_. It's recorded in the Imperial records, and you can go home and tell your clanmaster that the local land-baron can go take a flying leap. On the other hand if they lock you in your room BEFORE you can declare _Aridani_ status, you're socially considered 'their property' and certainly the marriage is for your own good.

And of course, everything is greased by gold. Say you declare your status with two witnesses and it's recorded on the register. But you're Golden Bough Clan and the reason you're declaring _Aridani_ is because then, instead of becoming the fourth wife of the Governor of _Sokatis_, you can marry that cute boy of the Rampant Chlen clan who peels the hides off the chlen and has such big muscles. By nightfall your two witnesses have been accidentally killed by inadvertent sword-thrusts to the gut, your records of status are nowhere to be found, your cute fiancé has been trampled by a chlen in the compound, and your clan is several thousand Kaitars poorer than the day before. And you're not _Aridani_ and you are on a litter bound for _Sokatis_, with "bound" having multiple meanings in this case.

# Appendix D: Suggested AD&D™ Rule Variations

## The Rules:

### Ability Scores:

Roll for Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, Dexterity, Constitution, Charisma, and Comeliness via whatever _AD&D_ system is considered desirable. I prefer to use Method IV, where players roll 3d6 twelve times, and place scores where desired, for the first six characteristics, and Comeliness is rolled without a choice. Comeliness is added from the 1st edition _AD&D Unearthed Arcana_ volume (p. 6), as Tekumel requires a physical appearance roll. Be sure to incorporate the bonuses and penalties to Comeliness from Charisma. If _Unearthed Arcana_ is unavailable, try the following:

Comeliness is modified by one's charisma. Subtract 2 from Comeliness if Charisma is less than 5, subtract 1 if Charisma is greater than 5 but less than 9, add 1 if Charisma is greater than 12 but less than 15, add 2 if Charisma is greater than 15. Comeliness may be less than 3 or greater than 18, and these scores make one inhumanly ugly or beautiful. Comeliness will affect reaction rolls for NPCs just like Charisma, so charismatic, good-looking PCs will have a double bonus.

Alternatively, you may choose to ignore comeliness and stick to charisma alone. In this case, keep in mind that charisma must also simulate physical appearance.

### Possible Non-human PC Races:

(See EPT, The _Tekumel Sourcebook Vol. 1_, or the _Tekumel Bestiary_ for more information.)

1. **N'luss**: +1 Str, -1 Int, -1 Dex, +2 Con, -1 Cha*, base AC 10, 1 HD. (Actually, N'luss are a subtype of human.)
2. **Ahoggya**: +2 Str, -1 Int, -2 Dex, +2 Con, -5 Cha* (minimum 1), base AC 6, 3 HD. Ahoggya have two attacks per round (against different targets if they are man-sized, or they may be against the same target if larger) at no penalty, and may have four attacks per round if surrounded.
3. **Hlaka**: +1 Dex, -2 Cha*, base AC 10, 1 HD.
4. **Pachi Lei**: -1 Cha*, base AC 10, 1 HD. Pachi Lei can see in the dark, and has a 30% chance of detecting ambushes, secret doors, etc. This rises to 50% if the character is actively searching for these things.
5. **Pe** **Choi**: +1 Dex, -1 Con, base AC 11, 1 HD. Pe Choi get two attacks per round against the same or different foes at a lesser penalty than humans (see below), and they have excellent hearing permitting an 80% chance of detecting secret doors and ambushes. This rises to 90% if the creature is actively searching. They heal wounds at only 75% the human rate, regardless if this is due to spell or rest.
6. **Pygmy** **Folk**: -1 Str, +2 Dex, -1 Con, -2 Cha*, base AC 11, 1/2 HD. They can see in the dark, and have better hearing than the Pe Choi, although at short range.
7. **Shen**: +2 Str, -1 Int, -2 Dex, +2 Con, -2 Cha*, base AC 8, 3 HD. Shen get an extra attack per round behind them by using their tail. Their tail does 1d4 damage. Notice that this is semi-involuntary, and friendly figures behind them may be struck.
8. **Swamp** **Folk**: +1 Con, base AC 10, 1 HD. Swamp folk are able to sense "wrongness", such as a change in direction, a slope, dimensional nexus points, etc.
9. **Tinaliya**: -2 Str, +1 Int, +1 Dex, -1 Cha*, base AC 11, 1/2 HD.
10. **Urunen**: +1 Int, -1 Con, base AC 10, 1 HD.

Notes:

1. Races with an * after Charisma means this modification has no effect when the character is dealing with others of the same species. Only Pe Choi use their comeliness score when dealing with humans. The hit dice score indicates the number of hit dice for first level characters. When characters attain a new level, they get one full hit die normal to their character class.
2. Yes, those are armor classes of 11 for some creatures. Treat it as AC 10, but the opponent gets an addition +1 to hit.

### Race and Character Class:

There are limitations to the level a character may attain, depending on their character class. The table below indicates these limitations:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Race**|**Max. Warrior Level**|**Max. Wizard/ Cleric Level**|
|**N'luss**|12 ([[#^comment-0\|Comment Unknown Author 1]])|5 ([[#^comment-0\|Comment Unknown Author 2]])|
|**Ahoggya**|12 ([[#^comment-0\|Comment Unknown Author 1]])|4 ([[#^comment-0\|Comment Unknown Author 4]])|
|**Hlaka**|12|12 ([[#^comment-0\|Comment Unknown Author 3]])|
|**Pachi Lei**|12|12|
|**Pe Choi**|12|12 ([[#^comment-0\|Comment Unknown Author 2]])|
|**Pygmy Folk**|9|12|
|**Shen**|12 ([[#^comment-0\|Comment Unknown Author 1]])|6|
|**Swamp Folk**|12|N/A|
|**Tinaliya**|9|12 ([[#^comment-0\|Comment Unknown Author 1]])|
|**Urunen**|12|2|

Notes

1. A high prime requisite allows higher limits:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Prime Requisite**|**Maximum Level**|
|14-15|13|
|16-17|14|
|18|15|
|19|16|

1. Pe Choi spell-casters can add one to their maximum attainable level on the prime requisite increase table.
2. Hlaka spell-casters must be shamans.
3. Shamans may be one level higher than wizards or clerics.

### Character Classes:

There are essentially three character classes available to players: Warriors, Wizards, and Clerics.

Warriors are simply fighters, no other classes allowed--no rangers and no paladins. Warriors must have a minimum strength of 9. I don't have a list of kits (I stopped buying AD&D materials when the various class handbooks came out), so I don't know enough about which ones would be appropriate. Kits should be chosen based on the types of careers available to warriors in the Five Empires.

Warriors from the Five Empires tend to fall into several categories. Choose kits that would simulate these roles:

1. Soldiers.
2. Gladiators from the Hirilakte arenas.
3. Bodyguards.
4. Police (tomb police, temple guards, Sakbe road guards, etc.) E. Secret agents (Omnipotent Azure Legion). [This should not be open to low-level PCs.]

Outside of the Five Empires, things are more flexible. You might consider barbarians (perfect for N'luss warriors) or other uncivilized, outdoorsy types. In any case, only the most unusual warriors will have access to either spells or spell-like abilities, if any of the kits permit these.

Spell-casting classes don't fit precisely to the AD&D system. On Tekumel, sorcery is a ritual/psychic exercise that is independent of the gods (therefore, no clerics in the AD&D sense), yet it is taught primarily by the temples, and one's choice of spells is completely determined by the deity one chooses to worship (hence, all spell-casters could be considered clerics in AD&D terms). An earlier draft of these rules, which used the Swords and Glory magic system, did not distinguish between clerics and wizards--all spell-casters were sorcerers. (This can still be accomplished using the magic system from the Gardasiyal rules set.) However, AD&D players may be more comfortable with separated cleric and wizard classes. This is easy enough to do, although perhaps not quite Tekumelani.

### Other character classes

A player may choose to be a non-spell casting priest of one of the temples. Such a priest could have religious and political power, but no adventuring ability: no armor, no weapons, no spells...not much fun for most players.

Players may also choose to be warrior-priests, warriors affiliated with their temple. Such characters have the advantage of gaining experience points for performing deeds that advance their temple's or their deity's interests. The disadvantage is that such characters are now going to be restricted by the orders that the temple will give them, and they will have less freedom of movement. Warrior-priests may use whatever weapons or armor they like: they are simply warriors with close ties to their temples. Warrior priests are most common to the temples of the war gods: Karakan and Chegarra, Vimuhla and Chiteng.

#### Shamans

Players may choose to be a "barbarian"; a person from outside of the Five Empires. Spell casters from non-civilized regions, such as jungles, deserts, and mountains, do not have temples to learn magic from. Instead, there are tribal shamans. Shamans may be either clerics or wizards, as above; the difference is that spells are not learned from the temples.

A shaman PC in the Five Empires is going to have real problems learning new spells--higher level shamans are virtually non-existent outside of their "wild" territories, and the temples are not going to teach spells to an outsider. PCs may join a temple in the Five Empires, of course, and simply learn temple spells in addition to their shaman spells. However, the temples are going to be very reluctant to admit a barbarian (so hefty bribes and "inducements" will be needed, and a good reputation will be useful). There may be tests each time a PC goes up a level, to "prove" that she/he is still committed to the values of the faith. Alternatively, PCs may journey back home to the wilds every time they go up a level. All in all, this option is best left to NPCs.

By the way, a PC shaman who joins a temple should not teach shaman spells to non-shamans, either. Although there is no "shaman's court" to try and execute a rogue shaman, it would unbalance the game. Such an unscrupulous person would not be likely to be taught spells in the first place.

#### Rogues:

Tekumel has no bardic tradition, so bards are not permitted. Thieves may be allowed, but only under special circumstances. Unlike most AD&D settings, the Five Empires are highly organized societies, and the police can be very effective. Any attempts to create a "thieves guild" would be ruthlessly stamped out by the authorities. This makes training to be a thief difficult. Without the political protection a thieves guild has (at the very least, without its ability to pay enormous bribes to the police forces to be left unmolested) an individual thief who made a career out of robbing the rich would be caught in short order, and their fate would make an example for others considering such a career. This limits thieves to robbing the poor, which is an unsatisfying career for a PC, and there's not much money in it. Further, given the social stratification of the Five Empires, thieves would not be likely to associate with wizards, priests, or high-level warriors; in short, it would be very difficult to create and maintain a standard AD&D-type party with a thief!

There are two exceptions in Tsolyanu that may be considered "thieves organizations". The first exception is the Assassin's clans: The Black Y Society, The Association of the Relievers of Life, and The Clan of Whispered Fear. PCs who wished to be an assassin would find their lives very circumscribed: targets would be selected by the clan elders, and individual initiative would be discouraged. It wouldn't be much of a game for players to simply receive their assignments, and then track their target and beat, main, or kill him or her, especially since an assassin's career consists of little but this. Outsiders are almost never invited to join an assassin's clan, and upstart rivals who don't belong to the three clans mentioned above would be ruthlessly suppressed, by means both legal and illegal. This is not a good option for PCs.

The other option is that of the quasi-accepted tomb robbing clans. Tomb robbers are barely tolerated in Tsolyanu, Yan Kor, and Salarvya; less so in Mu'ugalavaya, and ruthless extirpated in Livyanu. Tomb robbing is done in secret (the Nighted Tower Clan, the most well-known of the tomb robbing clans, staunchly claims its innocence of such activities), and only the lowest of the low do it. As such, tomb robbers never climb up society's ladder: PCs who choose to be a tomb robber can never mix with society, and will be scorned by anybody of higher than "Very Low" status. (Hence, no sorcerers or high-level warriors; such folk come from higher status backgrounds.) Tomb robbers are always up against the tomb police when they perform their activities. The tomb police can be bribed, of course, but they may also decide to make an example of somebody, especially if that person has despoiled an important person's resting place! The tomb police usually have the edge over parties of tomb robbers in numbers and combat ability; the tomb robbers are usually better at running away, hiding, and knowing the Underworld.

Should a DM decide to permit tomb robbers as a character class, they should not permit a pick pocket skill, as this is not what tomb robbers learn to do. Tomb robbers wear no armor--they are not warriors. Their weapons proficiencies are limited to dagger, knife, club, and short sword. They do not get back-stab abilities. The DM must decide if any kits are appropriate, but I don't think they should be. Since they all come from the same clans, it is unlikely that there are great differences between their orientations to robbing.

Tomb robbers might be allowed to make up a party with similarly low-class warriors to despoil the Underworlds, but sorcerers would be virtually unheard of. In fact, if tomb robbers invaded temple precincts in the underworlds, they could expect to be hunted by sorcerers of those temples.

At the DMs option, PCs may choose to be street-thieves: footpads, etc. These characters also do not get the back-stab option, and many not wear armor (too noticeable on the streets), and are limited to weapon proficiencies such as knives, daggers, and clubs. They may be allowed to pick pockets. However, this is does not offer much for a game:

1. If the band becomes too large, too successful, or both, the authorities will move to shut them down, and make examples of these people.
2. If the band makes a habit of robbing rich citizens (where the money is), they will be hunted down very quickly.
3. Street thieves are at the very bottom of the social order. Such individuals will never participate in the social or political parts of life on Tekumel.
4. Street thieves are unlikely to thrive as a party. Warriors make a group too organized (hello, impalement stake), and sorcerers are just plain out of the question.

The only exception I can see to the "no sorcerers with thieves rule" is if a party of thieves manages to convince a naive foreigner new to Tsolyanu to join them in their exploits. This foreigner is either not from the Five Empires (so probably a shaman), or just doesn't care about improving their life (such as if they were kicked out their temple in their native land or something like that). Notice that such sorcerers are going to find it next to impossible to find a tutor to go up levels.

Split Classes are generally not allowed. However, for non-humans and foreigners entering the Five Empires, this can be worked out in advance with the DM on a limited basis. A major problem is getting additional spells from the 20 Temples without following their rigid code of conduct. However, “gold has ways of greasing palms.”

### Alignment:

Stability and Change only. As we know, these do not correspond with "good" and "evil", but because _AD&D_'s spell list orients their spells this way, consider Stability as "good" and Change as "evil"--for spell purposes only! A "Protection from Evil" spell therefore becomes a "Protection from Change" spell; worshippers of Change do not necessarily have to act in an evil fashion.

Remember that citizens of the Five Empires are a great deal less concerned with "good" or "evil" than they are with "noble action". Just because priests of Vimuhla sacrifice humans daily on their great flaming altars doesn't mean that they aren't good company at dinner parties! Alignment on Tekumel is more a question of who you associate with and what ideals you strive for than a cosmic battle between the forces of Good and Evil.

### Proficiencies:

**Non-Weapon Proficiencies**: If non-weapon proficiencies are to be used, the skill lists from _Swords and Glory_ (section 2.239) or _Adventures on Tekumel, Vol. 1_ is recommended.

**Weapon Proficiencies**: Use _AD&D_ weapons proficiency rules, but specialization is only permitted after a warrior reaches 6th level. Warriors may obtain proficiency in any weapon they choose. Wizards and clerics are restricted to the weapon proficiencies the PHB allows their classes. Wizards and clerics of the temples of Vimuhla, Chiteng, Karakan, and Chegarra may learn to use any weapons. **_Wizards are permitted to try to use any weapon they want, but they will pay the -5 non-proficiency penalty._** Clerics may not use edged weapons at all unless members of the temples of the war gods and their cohorts, as mentioned above.

**Author's Notes**: The weapons specialization rule is one I use for standard _AD&D_ rules. The original purpose of weapon specialization was to make regular fighters attractive to play relative to paladins, rangers, cavaliers, and barbarians. With the removal of these latter two classes from the 2nd edition _AD&D_ rules, the need for specialization was eliminated, yet the rule was kept. My feeling is that it makes warriors too strong at the lower levels, but at the mid-to high level range, keeps them on a par with the wizards. If the DM chooses to permit specialization at 1st level, I recommend against allowing low-level Shen or Ahoggya warriors to choose this option, lest nobody play human warriors!

Bolas will entangle and fell an opponent unless the victim saves vs. breath weapon. Entanglement will last for 1 round during which the victim has no dexterity bonuses and counts as "stunned and prone" (+4 to be hit). Bolas generally only work on size M or smaller creatures, usually bipeds (unless legs necessary for balance are close enough together). (Taken from DRAGON #61).

Steel piercing and slashing weapons are automatically +1 to hit and +1 damage even before they are enchanted. Excellent steel piercing and slashing weapons are +2 to hit and +2 damage before being enchanted. Any enchantments are added on to this base. Bludgeon weapons don't get this bonus. If a steel bludgeon weapon is enchanted, only the enchantment bonus is added: there is never any bonus added to bludgeon weapons merely for being made of steel.

### Armor:

If the armor is made of steel, its armor class is improved by one; in effect, it becomes +1 armor. Armor made of excellent steel is the equivalent of +2. These bonuses apply to shields, also. Any enchantments added to the armor are added to the +1, so that the weakest of enchanted armors (enchanted to +1 and made of ordinary steel) is +2. Notice that Chlen-hide armor cannot be enchanted.

Use the appropriate Tekumel equipment list for armor costs rather than AD&D's equipment prices. S&G and Gardasiyal's equipment lists are preferable to EPT, but EPT should be used instead of AD&D's lists if that's all you have.

Padded armor is generally found in the extreme north, or it is used by peasants who cannot afford any better. Leather armor is the equivalent of S&G light infantry armor (light helmet, breastplate/pectoral, vambraces, and a leather tunic). Scale and chain mail are common: they are made of scraps of Chlen hide. Scale mail is more popular among the N'luss, while chainmail is more common in the Five Empires.

If you are using the S&G or Gardasiyal equipment list, consider both chainmail and scale armor as medium infantry armor (medium helmet, gorget, breast and back plate, vambraces, and greaves). Lamellar armor is not usually available for PC's: it will be found in Pechano, Yan Kor, and eastern Salarvya. Banded armor is the equivalent of heavy infantry armor (heavy helmet, gorget collar, breast and back plates, vambraces, greaves, mail kit, tasses, and sabatons).

If you are limited to EPT's equipment list, consider padded armor to cost as leather armor; scale mail costs 38 K, and banded or lamellar armor is plate armor.

**_Note that each armor assumes a helmet is worn_**. Characters may insist on wearing a heavier, lighter, or no helmet. Lighter or heavier helmets make no difference in combat, but no helmet means worsening armor class by one and could mean a lucky hit to the head for more damage and possible stunning.

Non humans and Armor: Each race has its own kinds of armor. To simplify the game, consider them as wearing human armor, but if the armor class of the armor they wear is less than their own natural armor class, consider their armor class to be 1 better than their natural armor class. Armor 2 or more classes below natural armor class of the creature is of no value, with the exception of shields.

## Magic:

### First, some general notes about magic on Tekumel:

Although sorcery is not dependent on the gods for it to work, the temples are the main sources of learning how to do it. Those priests who choose to specialize in sorcery are called "sorcerer/priests". Those who learn sorcery but choose to be somewhat aloof of their temple are called "lay-priests" or "jack-priests". Sorcerers are only taught those spells known to their temple (and the body of spells common to all temples). UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES MAY A PERSON LEARN A SPELL BELONGING TO ANOTHER TEMPLE. Temple sorcery is a tightly guarded secret, and those that betray those secrets can expect to be hunted down and executed in the most horrible fashion imaginable. Even scrolls of temple spells are enchanted so that only worshippers of the same deity (or his/her cohort) may use it. If a person wishes to abandon their faith and join another temple, their memory is wiped so that they cannot remember their spells, and they must start over as 1st level spell-casters (though they keep their hit points). Notice that there are some spells common to all temples; these are not kept secret because everybody already knows them.

Thus, whether one is a cleric (sorcerer-priest) or a wizard (lay priest) makes little practical difference in terms of capabilities. The differences mainly lie in personality, one's connections with the temple, and how involved one wishes to be in temple politics. I therefore offer three options as how to game sorcerers.

I. As close to _AD&D_ rules as possible. Simply use ordinary wizard and cleric rules:

1. Wizards get d4 for hit dice. Weapons proficiency is limited to dagger, dart, staff, knife, or sling. Notice that there are no "mages" or "specialist" wizards, as such: wizard characters must choose a deity or cohort to worship, and they get to learn the spells appropriate to that deity. However, on Tekumel, a wizard may wear leather armor if he/she wishes (but no shield!). You should not use the intelligence table to see if a Wizard can learn a spell: their lists are too depleted to allow them to fail to learn one.
2. Clerics get d8 for hit dice. Blunt weapons only are permitted, unless the cleric is a worshipper of Karakan or Vimuhla (or their cohorts). However, clerics are also limited to leather armor if they want to cast spells. (They are welcome to wear heavier stuff if they choose to melee only, and not cast spells.)
3. Both wizards and clerics may hire tutors, find scrolls, etc. to learn additional spells. Neither wizards nor clerics need spell­books: when they learn a spell, they know how to cast it. Spell books are used exclusively as teaching instruments here. Spells are memorized by sleep and meditation or prayer. Both wizards and clerics may wear nothing heavier than leather armor when spell­casting (no shield!), but clerics are allowed to wear heavier armor if they are not spell-casting.
4. In any case, wizards have intelligence as their prime requisite (minimum of 9 required) and clerics have wisdom as their prime requisite (minimum of 9 required). Clerics may be permitted experience points when they perform deeds that advance their temple's or their deity's interests. (Wizards don't care about such things.)
5. No matter which system is used, clerics do not have the ability to turn or command undead unless they are clerics of Ksarul, Gruganu, Sarku, Durritlamish, Belkhanu, or Qon. Clerics of Belkhanu or Qon can only turn undead, they cannot command them.
6. Clerics would seem to be more powerful than wizards at low levels, but wizards still have more powerful spells at the very highest levels.

### _AD&D_ Magic System

Some general comments on how _AD&D_ magic must be modified for Tekumel

1. There is no "magic" script. Spells are studied and learned using ordinary languages. The "Read Magic" spell is no longer necessary.
2. The complex spell-component system of _AD&D_ may be discarded. Instead, have Wizards purchase (and carry with them) a sorcerer's chest for about 150 Kaitars. If they buy a new one every adventure, they will have adequate components for spell casting. (The AD&D material components would hardly preserve the Tekumel "feel", anyway.) While I'm at it, Priests shouldn't need their holy symbol to cast spells either, although their robes and clothing will mark them as priests of their particular deity.
3. The spell lists include the _Player's Handbook_ and _Tome of Magic_ lists. "Wild Magic" is not a Tekumelani concept, and I have discarded nearly all of the spells listed there. There are no magic surges or random effects.
4. Most reversible spells are no longer reversible. You learn the type appropriate to your deity and training, and that's what you know.
5. On Tekumel, metal disrupts spell casting, which is why wizards wear no armor (and carry no coins or metal weapons). It's your option as to whether or not to include this rule. Wizards who cast spells while carrying metal can have the spell simply fail, lose additional spells from memory, or have the spells adversely affect them (if it can). You could simply have a wizard take 2d6 damage for casting a spell while carrying metal. Luckily, Chlen ­hide does not cause this effect, and the "Eyes" are non-metallic (see below). Notice that metal carried in extra-dimensional pockets are considered "on one's person" so long as a physical object needed to gain access to that pocket is on one's person, such as a Leomund's Tiny Chest being carried about.
6. By the way, Chlen hide armor also obstructs spell casting by restricting the freedom of movement needed to cast spells properly. This is mostly because in the Five Empires on Tekumel, armor is very ornate.
7. All spells summoning monsters, shadows, etc. have been deleted, as have spells involving riding. There are no riding animals on Tekumel to speak of, so there's no reason to believe wizards would have developed such spells. There is no such thing as elementals, either. However, every temple can summon "demons" (other planar beings) who generally support that temple's goals. These servants may be treated like _AD&D_ Tanari'i or Baatezu (or whatever they're called these days), but they come in both Stability and Change flavors. Demons of Change do tend to be quite as nasty as Tanari'i; there is little description of Demons of Stability to judge them.
8. Tekumel has rich connections to other planes, but not in _AD&D_ terms. There's no Astral, Ethereal, Inner, Outer, or Shadow Planes; instead there is a swarming infinity of "Demon Planes" around the Tekumel universe. In _AD&D_, one travels to other planes via the Astral or Ethereal plane; on Tekumel, one travels via "Nexus Points", which are more like _AD&D_'s Gate spell, in that they go directly from one plane to another. However, there is no guarantee that a Nexus Point will take you to your destination-­you must step from plane to plane, traversing a series of Nexus Points to get to where you want. Thus, even if you simply want to get to another place on Tekumel, 100 miles away, you may have to cross five demon planes in order to get there. Any _AD&D_ spell referring to planar travel, or the Astral or Ethereal plane, must be modified. "Contact Higher Plane", for example, simply contacts either one's deity, or one of the lesser races serving him/her. You don't specify the plane you request information from so much as the being you request information from. There is no astral plane in Tekumel's universe. An astral character becomes insubstantial and transparent, and can travel far distances more quickly than normally. At higher levels, the astral character may cross Nexus Points or go to other planes. There are no astral monsters, no astral vortexes, or other hazards of astral travel. You won't need the _Manual of the Planes_ for Tekumel!

# Appendix E: Suggested AD&D™ Temple Spell Lists

## Clerical Spells:

Clerics must choose their deity or cohort to worship. For our purposes, there is no difference between priests of a deity or a cohort; in practice there would be a host of minor differences. Clerics get to choose spells from both their deity's sphere and the All, Protection, and Healing spheres. The Raise Dead spell is likewise available to all clerics, regardless of deity. Shaman clerics gain access to the All and Healing spheres, as well as the Raise Dead spell.

## Wizard spells:

Wizard spells are not broken down by schools. Instead, they are divided by subject matter. As for clerics, wizards must choose a deity to worship, as their choice of spells will depend on their deity. Wizards may learn spells from their deity's list and the All list. As noted above, wizards are not permitted to choose spells from other temple lists no matter what the circumstance, nor may they ever cast spells from other temples, even if they find a scroll. Note that some spells are duplicated, and may be learned and used by different temples; this is okay. Spells from the Tome of Magic are at the end of each list.

There are an incredible number of spells out there. Add them as you see fit; here are some guidelines that I used to choose where they belong.

1. In general, the higher level a spell is, the more restricted to one deity it is likely to be.
2. Bob Dushay used the Swords and Glory list to guide me in which temples specialized in which kinds of magic. My list above should give you plenty of hints, too.
3. Try to keep spells consistent. If illusion spells are generally found in the temples of Hnalla, Belkhanu, Hru'u, Sarku, and Dlamelish, don't put an illusion spell in Ksarul's list for no reason.
4. No spells involving monster summoning or creation, Elementals, or specific other planes are included, nor are spells that depend on wild magic randomness for their effects.

# Encounter 0: We Meet In A Tavern

Standard Plot. Group of players meets for last time before the money runs out and they have to look for honest work.

## “I’ve Got A Neat Map”

A very strangely dressed man (It’s mid-December, blustery and cold, and he’s wearing a silk-like shirt and kilt) accompanied by a few of the City Watch and some courtesans enters the tavern. After surveying the inhabitants of the tavern, he mutters something to one of the guardsmen and the rest of his party heads for an unoccupied corner of the barroom while the stranger heads for your table.

“Do you mind if I join you?” The stranger offers a bulging purse of coins and says, “I’d like to buy the next round...”

“Please allow me to introduce myself,” he starts, “I am of the Clan of Black Water, Arjutme hiMerketme. I have come looking for you people because I have need of sharp swords and brave hearts. Your small group has gained that reputation.”

"I have a map." He looks around, furtively. "A treasure map. I bought it off a traveler from the lands south of the Southern Sea. I've been to the island, the map is indeed true--but it was too dangerous for me to be seen alone in that land. My presence, er, well, let us agree that I was asked to leave.

The man looks down, ashamed to continue--but realizes he must to gain the party’s trust.

“Well, if the truth be told, I was forced to leave because I have become an outcast from my temple. About a year ago, I was nearly arrested and false evidence was planted in my quarters. My rivals made it look as though I had plotted to steal and sell many of the sacred relics of the Ancients. Now, I have never been disloyal, but without money to speed up my appeals, the case could take longer than my remaining life!

“I have been desperate to regain my good name. My clan was forced to remove my name from the public rolls. I was cast out, nearly penniless, and then Hru’u smiled and I became the treasure map’s owner.

“The map tells the whereabouts of a treasure cache from many years ago. A treasure stolen from my clan by wicked pirates. Although my clan’s soldiers destroyed the pirate band, the treasure was hidden before it could be recaptured. It has been missing for 250 years. And now I have the map!

"I was hoping to hire you to take me there and recover the treasure. It's only six or seven days sailing south...

"I'd be willing to split the treasure with you--equal shares--but first I must know if you're willing. The bartender, and others, said you could trusted. The gold alone is reckoned above 10,000 crowns (GP). And, there is silver, there are gems of surpassing beauty, finely worked jewelry from the artisans of the East, and an enchanted weapon or two.

“All I ask is that you let me have one small item (if we find it) as part of my share. It’s a page from an ancient religious book my grandfather once owned. Although no longer magical, it holds great sentimental value to my clan. I would gain great prestige and be able to re-enter society. And, I would be able to very richly reward my friends who helped restore me to that position. "

**[_Insert a discussion about whether this is a good time to go, whether the treasure is really enough and how well it is guarded and by who or what, whether the danger is too great, the chance of running across pirates, storm, sea monsters, . . ._ ]**

[Those who want to fade out, do so here. The Brave and/or Greedy may read on...]

“It is decided, then. Please meet me at the city dock tomorrow before the midday meal. The ‘Queen of Everlasting Purity’ sails on the noon tide.

## A Sea Voyage

Your new “employer” meets you at the city dock in front of one of the most dilapidated trading ships you've ever seen. It's got barnacles. It's got jury-rigged masts. It's got moldy sails. This couldn’t be the ‘Queen’--but it is!

And, for the next week, it'll be your home. If you find the treasure, you think you'll be able to afford your own ship back. Perhaps a fleet of them...

## Pirates? Here?!?

At dawn on the fourth day out, the lookout spots a number of small ships and fishing boats that appear to be following you. As the morning grows into midday, there is a certainty of this. You're south of the regular shipping lanes and the ships are only half as far away as when first spotted.

By mid-afternoon, the lookout spies a pennant with three skulls flying from the mast of the nearest ship. Your worst fears begin to take shape. The three ships are full of pirates!

Quickly the captain weighs his options. After consulting with your employer and the other ships officers, he heads toward a storm some distance to the east. If you can make it there first, there may be a chance to avoid combat. **If** you can make it!

## The Big Storm

As your ship races toward the squall line to avoid the pirates, you notice the seas getting rougher. Even though faster, the pirate ships seem to back off as your ship heads into the storm. It's just as well. Your ship was not really designed for fighting pirates.

Suddenly, from directly ahead, you see what appears to be a wall of water towering 30 feet or more above the deck. The water crashes into the ship, lifting the bow to a seemingly impossible angle and driving the stern down. Down, down the ship seems to go. It feels as though you may be driven to the bottom.

As the wave crashes over the deck, crewmen are dashed against bulkheads and masts and some are washed overboard. The two sailors manning the tiller are washed away, sending the ship off course. Just then, another huge wave strikes the ship. Then there is a terrifying crash and someone shouts, "The mast!"

Slowly the ship starts to settle, listing ever farther and farther to port. The seas actually seem calmer for a moment and the deck becomes a seething mass of crewmen trying to cut loose the damaged rigging, repair what can be saved and restore order.

"Somebody grab that rope! Get the sails reefed! Cut loose that broken mast! "You two men! Get those passengers up on deck. Everyone works now if we're to avoid swimming back home!

The man with the map is beginning to appear a bit nervous and his voice begins to break, "Where's the Captain? I demand to see the Captain! I want to go back! I know my rights!"

"You fool!" shouts one of the ship's officers to the man who hired you. "You fool, you've brought down the wrath of the Sea Gods upon us! You should never have stolen that temple's map! If we escape from this, I'll see you pay!"

"Aiieeee! Here comes another one!" screams the lookout. "We're done for!"

"Grab the tiller! Bring her into the wind!"

"Everyone tie themselves to something solid!"

## “What Is That Bright Light?”

A third monster wave is approaching, you see it as a foam-covered mountain. Suddenly the top of the wave is enveloped in a blinding, almost liquid, light that envelopes the wave, the ship, and nearby water. You feel as though you are falling and the light slowly fades as you lose consciousness . . .

**_--Priests and Mages now pick a Tekumel deity from the list that matches their previously chosen deity or their personality..._** Don’t ask why, but you wake up with that name on your lips. Remember that Stability and Change are not exactly Law/Good and Chaos/Evil but may tend that way.

## Waking Up Far Away

As you regain consciousness, you realize you’re not dead. You wouldn’t hurt so much if you were. And wherever you are, it still smells like “The Queen”. You get up and look around and notice about half of the crew still alive and able to man the ship. Strangely, the only ship’s officer missing is the one who yelled at your employer.

### --Why Is It So Hot In December

Even though it’s night-time, the air is oppressively hot. In fact, it seems to be a summer afternoon temperature, about 85ºF.

### --Why Are There So Many Moons And No Stars?

A casual glance at the heavens tells you that something is terribly wrong. There appear to be five (count-’em) moons in the sky. There are no familiar constellations. In fact, for whatever reason, there don’t seem to be any stars at all...

## --Awards And Social Status

When the characters reach 5th level, they will have “performed many deeds of service to the everlasting glory of the Petal Throne” and will therefore be granted citizenship. It is assumed that they will also have learned some manners and thus will be welcome in society. They may be asked as speakers to public gatherings, challenged to friendly matches in the Hirilakte Arena, and invited to the “best” parties.

## --Joining A Clan Is Never Easy Unless You Have A Lot Of Money!

When a character reaches “name level” (i.e., stops getting extra hit dice and con bonuses), he or she is assumed to have contributed enough that a clan may be induced to allow membership. This will cost approximately 100,000GP for high-level clans, 75,000 for high-level, 60,000 for mid-level, 40,000 for low-level, and 25,000 for very low-level (but what’s the point of becoming a mat-weaver?)

Some clans, especially the very high level clans, can only be entered upon direct orders from the Petal Throne. With Dhichune currently wielding power, it is best not to contemplate that happening very soon...
