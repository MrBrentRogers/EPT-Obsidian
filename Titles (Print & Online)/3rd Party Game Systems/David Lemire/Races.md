**Races**
by David Lemire

Citizens of the _Empire of the Petal Throne_ are a proud and xenophobic lot. Unlike the Dungeons and Dragons worlds described in Forgotten Realms, Dragonlance, Greyhawk, Dark Sun, Mystara or Eberron, humans and other species in _Tsolyánu_ **do not** live near one another in villages, towns and cities. There is little ethnic diversity among humankind, and therefore little acceptance is unfortunately to be had of differences displayed by the _Pé Chói_, _Shén_, Pygmy Folk, or other once-alien species. A very few of these aliens are tolerated in the Empire, but by-and-large strict segregation is the rule.

This does not mean that non-humans cannot be citizens of _Tsolyánu_ or be found on missions for the Imperium; however, it does mean that they should be roleplayed as an extreme rarity.

_Patricia (playing Nrélu): So what is Evan’s new character exactly?_

_Dungeon Master (DM): Pygmy Folk, size of a Halfling but furred, large-beaked, and –_

_David (playing Héttukeng): So it’s a bird._

_Evan (Playing Silverback): He’s killed people for less._

_Emma (playing Tlayésha): Ha! That means he is guilty of “Burder”!_

_Evan (Playing Silverback): I hate you._

Not every intelligent species is suitable for developing as a player-character. This being a 40 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) Anniversary, old-school, EPT product, the non-human species available for play are limited to the _Pé Chói_, the _Shén_ and the Pygmy Folk. Each of these three is characterised by certain advantages and/or disadvantages that affect the roles it is best suited to fulfil. For example, the _Pé Chói_ are highly psychic and make powerful Magic Users, the _Shén_ stand about seven feet tall and make great Fighters, and the diminutive Pygmy Folk (_Ninínyal_, if the actual _Tsolyáni_ term is preferred) make fine Scouts.

Mankind is characterised by its ability to fulfil all roles [Leader, Fighter, Magic User, and Scout. More on roles, within the game’s mission alliances, and Character Class follows]. For now, players should be accepting of the fact that most characters will be Human, with perhaps one belonging to an available alien species for the advantages they bring.

**Human**

_Tsolyánu_ is an imperial expanse roughly the size of the Unites States of America. People are, however, extremely similar to one another across that entire terrain (which includes high mountains, plains, jungles and deserts). Men average about 5 feet, 5 inches in height, and women are a few inches shorter. Both generally are wiry to medium in build. Skin colour is coppery-brown, and hair is uniformly fine, straight and glossy black. Men as well as women have little body hair, so beards are rare in the Imperium. Brown to black eyes are the only phenotype, and noses are often hawk-like and large. Women, of course, are a shade or two lighter in tone, and their noses are slightly less aquiline and smaller. The eyes of the women of the _Empire of the Petal Throne_ are famous for their size, shape, and smoky allure.

Foreigners can be shorter or taller, heavier, hairier, or slightly more golden in colour, but most citizens conform to the above and are proud of their looks.

**Traits**

_Tsolyáni_ citizens are various in ability and therefore have the following traits.

**_Ability Score Increase:_** Two different ability scores of your choice increase by 1.

**_Skills:_** You gain proficiency in one skill of your choice.

**_Alignment:_** The _Tsolyáni_ most often worship the _Tlomitlányal_, translated as ‘the Lords of Glory’, and are generally good. _Empire of the Petal Throne_ does not encourage friends around the table to roleplay evil characters (these are best left as NPC antagonists).

**_Feat:_** You gain one feat of your choice.

**_Tékumel Tyrants:_** You gain advantage on Persuasion skill rolls vs _Dzór_, _Hláka_, _Páchi Léi_, _Pé Chói_, _Rényu_, _Swamp Folk_, and _Tinalíya_.

**_Engsvanyálu Envy:_** Any time a foreign or non-human NPC implies that _Tsolyánu_ is less than the greatest empire extant, you gain advantage on Insight, Intimidation, and Persuasion skill rolls until the end of the encounter.

You must finish a short rest before you can use this ability again.

**_Languages:_** _Tsolyáni_ is the language of the empire, although magic users must often master ancient tongues in order to further their studies.

**Pé Chói**

The western provinces of _Tsolyánu_ are covered in a vast forest called _The Chákas_. Under the eaves of this immense woodland a civilisation of once-alien beings exists – that of the _Pé Chói_. These creatures are the most temperamentally similar to mankind of all its allies, and are found in the empire more than any other non-human species. The _Pé Chói_ are vaguely insectoid in shape and appearance, like a tailed upright ant with the head of a seahorse. Their fan-shaped, backswept ears give them their _Tsolyáni_ nickname – the listeners. They also have a series of psychic powers that make them a powerful racial choice if one wants to play a magic user. They are about 6 feet tall, a greyish-green in colour, and six-limbed. A _Pé Chói_ walks on his hind two legs and has four small arms with which to gesticulate in near human fashion. The eyes of _Pé Chói_ are a lambent green.

Names

The _Pé Chói_ have three sexes, and only the neuter gender ever leaves the _Pé Chói_ racial enclave in _Dó Cháka_ to join human society. Neuter names include Chk-P’tk-Kk Chtík-P’qwé Dsík-Tè’chí Hét-Kw Tè-Ktêng Ktò’típ- Ssíù Kt’t’r-Kí Nchikp’q-Pkétk Tqú-Ptcht’tik-Né Tke’e-T’kl. The _Tsolyáni_ don’t try all that hard with these names; they often just use, or butcher, the first syllable and leave it at that.

Traits

The _Pé Chói_ are somewhat similar to High Elves in more commonplace D&D worlds, but there are interesting differences.

**_Ability Score Increase:_** Your Intelligence ability score increases by 2.

**_Skills:_** You gain proficiency in the skill of Arcana.

**_Alignment:_** All _Pé Chói_ living among humans worship the _Tlomitlányal_, the Lords of Glory, and are always good. _Empire of the Petal Throne_ does not encourage friends around the table to roleplay evil characters (these are best left as NPC antagonists).

**_Darkvision:_** You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern colour in darkness, only shades of grey.

**_Pé Chói Senses:_** You have proficiency in the Perception skill and can perceive items hidden from or even invisible to the human eye. You pick up emanations and gain advantage against ambush attempts, always know when magic is nearby, and instantly know when a nearby _Pé Chói_ experiences fear, pain or death.

**_Ntk-Dqékt:_** You gain advantage on any two skills and/or abilities of your choice while, and only while, pursuing a foe that has murdered a _Pé Chói_.

**_Languages:_** _Tsolyáni_ is the language of the empire, although _Pé Chói_ have their own languages (which no human can learn or even understand).

**Shén**

To the far southwest of _Tsolyánu_ there lies the home of the _Shén_. This hot, volcanic land is cruel, and no ordinary creature can survive there. The _Shén_, however, thrive there, but quite often tour other nations in search of mercenary work. Armoured like a dragon, in deep gleaming black scales and having a terror-bird’s beak and spines that flare up along the back of its skull as battle looms, it is little wonder that the _Tsolyáni_ know _Shén_ as “the demon warriors” and employ them as auxiliary troops in the armies of the empire whenever possible. A _Shén_ uses heavy chopping swords, spears, and its own beak (filled with a double row of razor-sharp fangs) and tail (which ends in a dense, dangerous battering knob) for securing victory in physical combat. _Shén_ disdain magic use, and value strength, endurance and ferociousness instead. The _Shén_ never forgive a slight, and hate all _Ahóggya_ with unremitting zeal.

Names

The _Shén_ enter human society to fight, so only males make the long journey to _Tsolyánu_. _Shén_ male names include A-Shg-Ssá Chrâ-Ssé-Kk Etk-ti-Tsú Fr-Ssâ-Chì Grg-Ssá Hú-Shà-Gsh Mrgág Nkék Shékw and Ss-Qâ-Hs. The _Tsolyáni_ try a bit harder with _Shén_ names; they are afraid of them.

Traits

The _Shén_ are distantly similar to Half Orcs and Dragonkin in more commonplace D&D settings, but there are major differences.

**_Ability Score Increase:_** Your Strength ability score increases by 2.

**_Skills:_** You gain proficiency in the skill of Intimidation.

**_Alignment:_** All _Shén_ living among humans worship the _Tlomitlányal_, the Lords of Glory, and are always good. _Empire of the Petal Throne_ does not encourage friends around the table to roleplay evil characters (these are best left as NPC antagonists).

**_Size:_** Medium to Large.

**_Shén Scaling:_** You maximum hit point total increases by 1 per level. Additionally, your dragon-like scales mean that when you aren’t wearing armour, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier and this boost increases by 1 at 4 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]), 12 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) and 20 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) level.

**_Intimidating Presence:_** Beginning at 1 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) level, you can use your action to frighten someone with your intimidating presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On further turns, you may use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature.

This effect ends if the creature finishes its turn out of sight or more than 60 feet away from you. If the creature makes its saving throw, you can’t use this ability on that creature again for 24 hours.

**_Savage Attacks:_** When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you may roll one of the weapon’s damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.

**_Languages:_** _Tsolyáni_ is the language of the empire and _Shén_ pronunciation is sibilant, hissing and menacing.

**Pygmy Folk**

On the far side of the _Thénu Thendráya_ _Massif_, the sprawling burrows of the Pygmy Folk are to be found.

Names

The Pygmy Folk enter _Tsolyánu_ usually in order to trade, and very often these beings offer their ability as spies and assassins as a commodity. Their names are impossible to pronounce, so humans call them such descriptive epithets as Silverback, Footpad and Bright-eyes.

Traits

The Pygmy Folk are vaguely similar to Halflings and Gnomes in more common-place D&D settings, but there are serious divergences.

**_Ability Score Increase:_** Your Dexterity ability score increases by 2.

**_Skills:_** You gain proficiency in the skill of Stealth.

**_Alignment:_** All Pygmy Folk living among human beings worship the _Tlomitlányal_, the Lords of Glory, and appear to be good. _Empire of the Petal Throne_ does not encourage friends around the table to roleplay evil characters (these are best left as NPC antagonists).

**_Size:_** Small.

**_Speed:_** Your base speed in 25 feet.

**_Darkvision:_** You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern colour in darkness, only shades of grey.

**_Lucky:_** When you roll a 1 on an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you may reroll the die and must use the new roll.

**_Ninínyal Stealth:_** You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours. Additionally, you can attempt to hide even when you are obscured only by a creature that is at least one size larger than you.

**_Languages:_** _Tsolyáni_ is the language of the empire, and interestingly the Pygmy Folk mimic it flawlessly. The same cannot be said of Tsolyáni trying to speak the reverse; humans cannot speak Pygmy Folk at all.
