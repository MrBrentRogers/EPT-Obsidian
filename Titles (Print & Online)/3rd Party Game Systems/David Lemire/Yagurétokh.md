**yagurétokh**
by David Lemire

Stepping out from the shadow of an alleyway, the Invisible One sank his poniard into the base of the skull of the _Salarvyáni_ embassy legate. Before he was spotted, he vanished back into the darkness; not a soul noticed. Without looking back, the man – who rarely drew blood as a _yagurétokh_ – hurried through a pre-planned escape route. By the time the legate’s people even understood that violence had occurred, he was over a _tsán_ away.

While the religious parade continued along the causeway toward the path that wound steeply up to the Pinnacle of Silence, she waited clinging high under eaves of the temple’s roof. At that moment when no torches shone up at her, she broke a roof tile, then another, and then she squirmed inside. The attic was packed with marked chests of stored documents; now for the information that would prove a _Vríddi_ to be none other than the Emperor’s heir, she thought.

The tomb robber wrenched himself free of the opening to the Ultimate Labyrinth. All around him were the _Tolék Kána Pits_, the subterranean prison across the _Mssúma River_ from _Bey Sǘ_. He must be quick! Somewhere nearby was a young nobleman, abducted on the orders – everyone knew it was so – of _Prince Dhich'úne_. He must be quick to free the young man, or both he and the young man would be dead . . . or worse!

Although he or she may steal, the _yagurétokh_ isn’t a thief. Although the _yagurétokh_ may kill, she or he isn’t an assassin. Although full of trickery, the Invisible One (as the _Tsolyáni_ term all break-and-enter espionage agents) isn’t a _trickster_ in the western or common fantasy sense of the word. The _yagurétokh_ is a highly capable individual, versed in a number of important skills. Disguise, forgery, impersonation, shadowing, listening in, climbing sheer walls, lock-picking, elimination, ciphers and code-breaking – these are just a few of the skills of the Invisible Ones.

**Visibly Able, and Invisible**

There are no organised thieves, or Thieves’ Guilds, in any of the Five Empires. _Tsolyánu_ and its rival empires simply put thieves to death. While there are clans who legally carry out assassination, the actions of their members are closely regulated and monitored by the Imperium. Only after all legal avenues have been exhausted may one employ an assassin. There also is no tradition or myth which extols the features of a trickster in the culture of _Tsolyánu_. The _Empire of the Petal Throne_ is a very structured society, and encouraging tricks or such would be inconceivable to most commoners and aristocrats alike. There is, therefore, no place for a typical D&D rogue, whose life would be short and whose family and clan would probably be the first to turn him in to the Imperium.

**The Chrí on the Wall**

There is, however, a place in _Tsolyánu_ for an intelligence gatherer, a covert operator, an expert at navigating the underworld. In an empire of the complexity of _Tsolyánu_, with at least four major factions vying for political power, there is bound to be scope for this sort of work. There is no clan that devotes itself to the profession of “invisible action”. Instead, the highest clans encourage members of a certain predilection to develop their talents at reconnaissance, pilfering, and even silent murder, and to put those developed gifts to work for clan and country. Others, too, of lower social class, get involved.

The Invisible Ones enter into citizen alliances to build their contact networks, to keep abreast of all events, and finally to contribute to the welfare of the Imperium.

In general parlance, whenever events occur for which there is no obvious agent, it is said that they have been the result of the _yagurétokh_!

**Your Concept**

As you build your _yagurétokh_, think about three related elements of your character concept: where you got your espionage training, and what you expect to get from working as a spy/assassin, and how you feel about committing crimes. What clan or palace superiors recruited you and trained you? What previous missions have you finished? What is your favourite espionage activity: climbing high vertical walls, decoding codes, forgery or murder?

Work with your DM to figure out how answers to these questions give substance to your acting, your roleplaying.

You should establish a schematic of your exact intelligence network. You have one contact above you, but four to six contacts below you. These are your informants and specialists (able to do those jobs about which you know little).

Naturally, the other players around the table are contacts of yours. You may consider them to be your underlings, but the Leader character, at a minimum, thinks of you as his or hers.

Ask yourself how you feel, being a good person, worshipping one of the _Tlomitlányal_, about having to lie, impersonate people, forge documents, follow people around, frame people, and even murder, to achieve noble objectives. Where do your limits and red lines lie? These are important issues.

**Class Features**

As a _yagurétokh_, your get the following class features.

**Hit Points**

**Hit Dice:** 1d8 per _yagurétokh_ level.

**Hit Points at 1 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) Level:** 8 + your Constitution modifier.

**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per _yagurétokh_ level after first.

**Proficiencies**

**Armour:** Light armour

**Weapons:** Simple weapons, assassin’s weapons

**Tools:** Thief

**Saving Throws:** Dexterity, Intelligence

**Skills:** Choose two skills from Acrobatics, Athletics, Deception, Etiquette, Insight, Intimi-dation, Perception, Performance, Persuasion, Stealth.

**Equipment**

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

- light armour (soft _chlén_-hide)
- two easily concealable simple weapons
- thieves’ tools
- dungeoneer’s pack or explorer’s pack

**Expertise**

At first level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one skill proficiency combined with thief tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for all ability checks made with either of those two proficiencies.

At sixth level, you choose another two skills or tools with which to double proficiency.

**Sneak Attack**

Beginning at first level, you know how to strike subtly and to exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a simple or a ranged weapon.

You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.

The amount of the extra damage increases by 1d6 every two levels gained in this class. At twentieth level the extra damage is 10d6.

**Cunning Action**

Starting at second level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.

**Skein of Destiny**

At third level, you gain the ability to twist the rules of _Empire of the Petal Throne_ to suit your needs. You gain 2 of the following Skein of Destiny rules abilities, another 1 at tenth level, and a final 1 at nineteenth level.

**Careful Ability**

You gain a +5 bonus to 1 ability, initiative, or attack roll you make. You can’t use this feature again until you have finished a short rest.

**Distant Ability**

You are able to double the range of 1 ability, passive perception, or ranged attack roll that you make. You can’t use this feature again until you have finished a short rest.

**Empowered Ability**

You are able to double the die range attached to any 1 ability, class feature, or feat that you have (example +1d6 damage becomes +2d6). You can’t use this feature again until you have finished a short rest.

**Extended Ability**

You are able to double the duration of 1 ability, class feature, or feat that you have. You can’t use this feature again until you have finished a short rest.

**Heightened Ability**

When you use an ability, class feature, or attack that forces a target to make a saving throw against your effect. You force a disadvantage onto that 1 saving throw roll. You can’t use this feature again until you have finished a shot rest.

**Quickened Ability**

You are able to halve the performance time of 1 ability, class feature, or feat that you have. You can’t use this feature again until you have finished a short rest.

**Subtle Ability**

You are able to eliminate all signs of your being the source of 1 ability, class feature, or feat that you have. You can’t use this feature again until you have finished a short rest.

**Ability Score Improvement**

When you reach fourth level, and again at eighth, twelfth, sixteenth and eighteenth levels, you may increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or two ability scores of your choice by 1. You cannot increase an ability score above 20 with the use of this feature.

**Fast Hands**

Beginning at fourth level, you can us the bonus action granted by Cunning Action to make a Dex-terity (sleight-of-hand) ability check, use your thieves’ tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action.

**Deft Stride**

Starting at fifth level, moving through non-magic difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also move through ruined or rubble-filled land without being slowed by it or taking damage from broken shards, wire, caltrops or similar hazards. Only a wall created by sorcery, one that moves to a target point, can bypass this feature.

**Evasion**

Beginning at sixth level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as an Excellent Ruby Eye’s beam or an area effect spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

**Second Storey Work**

At seventh level, you gain the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement.

In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.

**Spider- Climb**

Beginning at eighth level, you can climb sheer and slippery surfaces, avoid hazards while scaling wall heights, and cling to these even while something is trying to knock you off. You have double proficiency on your DC roll to succeed at these types of tasks.

**Infiltration Adept**

Starting at ninth level, you can unfailingly create false identities for yourself. You must spend time and money to establish the history, connections of clan, and professional abilities of your persona. This usually involves acquiring appropriate dress articles, clan tabards, letters of introduction, and official circle qualifications to establish yourself as a clanmember or palace official from a remote city. You then insinuate yourself into your target, so as to glean intelligence.

Thereafter, you can adopt the identity as a disguise and the infiltrated group believes in your story until given reason to do otherwise.

**Vanish**

Starting at tenth level, you can use a Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can’t be tracked by non-magical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.

**Hide in Plain Sight**

Beginning at tenth level, you can spend 1 short or long rest creating a disguise for yourself. You must have access to the dress and jewellery items seen within the destination you would like to enter.

Once you are disguised, you can enter a target (such as a temple or palace) and move through it without attracting the attention of those inside. You gain a +10 bonus to Charisma (Performance) checks when you speak to others inside.

**Reliable Talent**

By eleventh level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

**Blind Sense**

Starting at twelfth level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.

**Reliable Talent**

At thirteenth level, you gain the ability to mimic the speech and mannerisms of a target individual. You must spend at least three hours studying the target’s behaviour. Your mimicry is indiscernible to a casual observer, but a close friend, lover, or parent would force a Charisma (Deception) roll at a disadvantage. At eighteenth level this disadvan-tage disappears. At twentieth level it becomes an advantage.

**Use a Magic Device**

By fourteenth level, you have learned enough about the workings of magic that you can improvise the use of items even when they are not intended for you. You ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the use of sorcerous items or devices of the Ancients.

**Supreme Sneak**

Starting at fifteenth level, you have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.

**Slippery Mind**

At sixteenth level, you have greater mental strength and gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.

**Yagurétokh Reflexes**

When you reach seventeenth level, you have become adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can’t use this feature when you are surprised.

**Uncanny Dodge**

Starting at eighteenth level, when an attacker hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you.

**Extra Attack**

Starting at nineteenth level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you make an attack on your turn.

**Stroke of Destiny**

At twentieth level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
