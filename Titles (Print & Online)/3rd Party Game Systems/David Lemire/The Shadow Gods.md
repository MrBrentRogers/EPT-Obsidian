**_The Shadow Gods_** _– The Religion of Livyánu_
by David Lemire

As their name implies, the gods of Livyánu exist in a shadowy grey area between good and evil; each god has both pleasant/noble and violent/frightening aspects balanced against one another.

_Qame’él –_ Chief of the Pantheon, a civic cult of the Livyáni noble classes, worshipped by nobles throughout Livyánu, apparently a god of civilisation, law, religious law, monumental architecture, etc., thus similar to Hŕsh in Mu’ugalavyá.

_The Shadowed One_ – God of Creation, Hnálla and Hru’ú combined, worshipped throughout Livyánu.

_Kirrinéb_ – Goddess of Ancestors, Provenance and Temple; a combination of Avánthe and Dlamélish, thus very similar to Shirringgáyi of Salarvyá.

_Ru’ungkáno_ – God of War, but more than simply Karakán and Vimúhla combined.

_The Horned One of Secrets_ – God of Culture and Knowledge, similar to a combination of Thúmis and Ksárul.

_Ndárka_ – God of Death and the Afterlife, thus akin to a combination of Belkhánu and Sárku.

_Vrusæmáz_ – God of Preservation, similar to the gods Trekhúish in Mu’ugalavyá and Wurú.

_The Sea Goddess of Karkársha –_ Goddess of fertility and female concerns; therefore most like an amalgamation of Dilinála and Hriháyal.

_Guodái –_ God of Men’s concerns (Honour, athletic ability, weapon skill, sexuality), so somewhat like a blend of Chegárra and Chiténg.

_Kikumársha –_ God of Healing and Hurting (through disease), thus somewhat of a synthesis of Keténgku and Grugánu.

_The Lost One of the Sea –_ God of those who have died at sea or whose bodies have not been recovered by their Temple (therefore without proper burial rites); distantly a combination of Qón and Durritlámish.

_Quyó_ – A Nature Goddess of the Tláshte Heights, responsible also for all uncivilised peoples, tribal cultures, and the insane, clanless, very poor, and imprisoned.

Perhaps, the same as Quyéla, an Aspect of Avanthé.

The Livyáni are rumoured also to worship, as gods, demons such as Kurritlanéb, Origób, and The Beast without a Tail, and to even worship Pariah Gods.
