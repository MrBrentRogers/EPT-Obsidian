_The Artfulness of Lady Sarvodáya  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]])_

_Death to Tuléng  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]])_

A sphere of utter darkness is created with the target as its center. At lower levels of skill this sphere shrouds an area only an arm’s length in diameter. At highest levels it may engulf an entire city or even a region.

Makes the target less likely to heal or be healed. It is resisted by the target’s Balétl. The spell subtracts 1 – 5 points from any natural recovery roll or healing skill, spell, or device effect. Only a remove curse can break this spell.

**_Sarvodáya Diˈéla’s Magic Items_**

Aside from talismans, scrolls, rings, eyes, armbands, bracers and other lesser magical items, Sarvodáya owns the following:

_Necklace of the Five-fold Veddhóru_

This Bednálljan necklace has five amulets plus two powerstones (one red and one green) depending from a central crescent. It essentially protects its wearer from all physical, psychic, ritual, ancient techno, and gaze attacks. It is very powerful. Only an Undying Wizard or demon could hope to pierce its shield.

_Jar of Shadows_

Sarvodáya enchanted this item herself. It releases 3d6 Voródla, all of which obey her commands.

_The Metabrogolor_

This Mrídlenelàni item presents puzzles to one who operates it, fascinating that target as per the spell.

_Hypnotic Orb_

This creation of the great Nyélmu presents illusions to one who gazes into it, invading his dreams and eventually trapping her in the wizard’s garden.

_Moon Boots_

These boots allow rapid travel by foot if the moons are in the sky. Speed depends on the phases of the two moons.

_Ship of the Great Ancients_

This space yacht is crewed by five, and can accommodate passengers. It is able to open nexus points (and even can create them) to the Planes Beyond, having been through the Unending Grey several times. It fairly bristles with sorcerous and technological weaponry. It reaches hypersonic speed in Tékumel’s atmosphere.
