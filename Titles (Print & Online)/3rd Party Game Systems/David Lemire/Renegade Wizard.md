**Renegade Wizard**
by David Lemire

Taking into his hands a millennia-old amulet of grey-tarnished electrum, a young explorer in blue robes of sturdy _Fírya_-cloth invokes his demonic (or other-planar) mentor before advancing upon the two giant _Hrá_ guarding the entrance of the crypt.

As the flesh-scouring sandstorm in the Desert of Sighs begins to moan and howl, the monastery outcast glimpses the ensorcelled tower of _Thómar_ the Everliving – to whom she has bound herself by contract and mind-bar.

Suddenly stunned by no less than that divine presence which has forever exalted and damned his life, the apostate scholar-priest traces the tight circle-and-dot glyph of The One Other in the air before his upturned face.

Renegade wizards are essentially good citizens who flirt with evil powers in order to gain the lore denied to ordinary magic users. This lore is buried and hidden and proscribed because it challenges the very foundations of society. All the nations who were once a part of great _Engsvanyálu_ subscribe to the same basic truths, that the eternal battle between the _Tlomitlányal_ (the Lords of Glory) and the _Tlokiriqáluyal_ (the Masters of Shadow) defines all that exists. But there are certain demons who are allied to neither good nor evil; there are Undying Wizards who chuckle at such pieties, and there is The One Other, a god recognized by, and yet not included in, the religion which culturally unites all of the Five Empires.

Surely there is something more than meets the eye going on here.

**Beguiled or Enlightened**

The renegade wizard is defined by a partnership with some otherworldly being that opens his or her eyes to the many contradictions of the religion of _Tsolyánu_. Why this otherworldly patron has taken on the young rebel varies. It might be pure spite and maliciousness. It might be recognition of some potential in the student. It might be so divine as to defy logic. Whatever the reason, the mentor guides and instructs and equips the renegade wizard as his awareness expands. Often the mentor requires missions be accomplished in return for her advice and instruction.

The abilities which arise from the partnership of the renegade wizard and his or her mentor are often subtle, for to expose to those in authority the heresy of one’s magical practice is to invite instant destruction. The mentor possesses its ward when necessary, as when it makes possible seeing in the dark or reading with native familiarity any ancient language; no magic is involved and the ability can’t be detected by temple castigators. Unlike orthodox spell-casters, renegade wizards risk progressive changes to their outlook, personality, and even physical appearance as they advance.

**Delvers into Deep Secrets**

The renegade wizard is driven by an insatiable thirst for knowledge and for truth. Having had the searing experience of discovering the hypocrisy of the religious authorities of _Tsolyánu_, she or he is compelled to question, question, question, even up to twentieth level.

Many of the fabulous sorcerers of folk-tale and legend were renegades in their youths. Some, like _Turshánmü_, were eventually destroyed by their delvings. Others, _Metállja_ the Musician for one, reach the realms of myth and perhaps continue to cast cosmic incantations even to this day.

Renegades enter into citizen alliances because they feel loyalty to their Emperor, and because the chief threat to the Imperium lies not in the palaces of foreign lands, but in the priesthoods right here at home.

**Your Concept**

As you make your renegade wizard character, be mindful of how your choice of mentor will affect the way you dramatize your citizen’s conflicts over secrecy, obligation, fear, and power. What led you to first seek forbidden knowledge and how did you initially make contact with your mentor? Were you forced to find shortcuts, or are you so intelligent that the contradictions of the religious system are obvious to you? Did you research the necessary invocation rituals in your temple’s arcane library, or did your mentor approach you? Do you resent the services you must provide, or do you serve happily in anticipation of promised rewards?

Work with your DM to figure out how answers to these questions give substance to your acting, your roleplaying.

If you choose to have _Llyánmàkchi_ as your evil mentor, how does this demoness communicate with you? What guise does she adopt? What of the demands she makes?

If you choose to have a partnership with the Undying Wizard _Sarvodáya Di‛éla_, just how impor-tant an apprentice are you? Are you hopelessly in love with this darkly beautiful archmage? What of her mental and emotional manipulations?

If you choose to have The One Other as patron, how do you deal with belonging to an illegal cult? What lies have you told to explain your sorcerous power? If the god intervenes to assist in your spell casting, what are your explanations?

**Class Features**

As a renegade wizard, your get the following class features.

**Hit Points**

**Hit Dice:** 1d6 per renegade wizard level.

**Hit Points at 1 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) Level:** 6 + your Constitution modifier.

**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per renegade wizard level after 1 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]).

**Proficiencies**

**Armour:** Light armour

**Weapons:** Simple weapons

**Tools:** Thief

**Saving Throws:** Intelligence, Charisma

**Skills:** Choose two skills from Arcana, Deception, Etiquette, History, Investigation, Nature, Religion.

**Equipment**

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

- any simple weapon
- a glyph which serves as an arcane focus
- a backpack
- invoker’s powders, chalks, blood, etc.

**Your Mentor**

Besides the accepted pantheon of gods recognised officially in _Tsolyánu_, there exist numerous lesser, or perhaps greater, beings in the universe that are demonstrably real (although denied and outlawed by the priesthoods). There are demons that have no apparent connection to either the _Tlomitlányal_ or the _Tlokiriqáluyal_. There are Undying Wizards who appear far more powerful than even the gods. There is The One Other, who was worshipped in _Tsolyánu_ three millennia ago, but whose temples were completely destroyed by emperor _Trákonel I: the Blazing Light_.

**Mentor-Assisted Magic**

Your quest for truth and the guidance bestowed on you by your mentor have given you a magical practice that is heretical and must be kept secret.

See chapter 4 for the general rules of magic use and chapter 5 for the renegade wizard spell list.

**Talent Magic**

Talent Magic describes those spell-like abilities a psychic person is able to perform without having to prepare incantations or expend spell slots. The psychic abilities falling under this rubric are what one might expect – ESP, telepathy, telekinesis and the like.

**Spell Slots**

The renegade wizard class chart shows how many spell slots you have. To cast the more orthodox of your spells, you must expend a slot. Because your mentor assists in your incantations, all your slots are the same level, so by 5 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) level even your 1 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) level spells are more powerful (the equal of spells of the 3 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) level). This increased power of your lower level hexes tapers off because your magical practice is increasingly dominated by lost, secret or outlawed spells as you advance. These proscribed practices are described later on.

**Spell Magic Progression**

The renegade wizard class chart describes the increasing number and power of those spells that you glean from the accepted, orthodox tradition of sorcerous instruction. Because you are concerned with breaking through to deep secrets denied by a very jealous hierarchy (the priesthoods) several of your spells have to do with knowledge, by-passing mind-bars, charming men and monsters, evading detection, etc. Because the taint of heresy cannot be kept perfectly secret, no sorcery tutor working within a temple academy will ever invite you into their confidence and teach you those spells limited to only the most dedicated and trusted students. These are spells of the 6 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) – 9 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) level. Instead, you learn lost, secret, and forbidden spells from your mentor (who often assists in their casting, which saves you from having to expend a spell slot!).

Additionally, whenever you gain a new level in this class, you can discard one of the renegade wizard spells you know for another, appropriate in level.

**Spellcasting Attacks/Saves**

Any conventional sorcery you employ that expends a spell slot uses Intelligence as the ability against which DCs are rolled. Your spell attack modifier = proficiency bonus + Intelligence modifier; whereas sorcery you employ with assistance of your mentor (that doesn’t expend a spell slot) uses Charisma as the ability against which DCs are rolled. Spell save DCs add 8 for conventional spells and 11 for those cast with the help of your mentor.

**Spellcasting Focus**

Renegade wizards, like other magic users, employ one or more arcane focus to channel energies from the Planes Beyond. This might be a wand, staff, or other item – usually inscribed with glyphs in long dead languages.

**Eldritch Invocations**

Your partnership with your mentor means that they assist you with certain spells. They intervene on your behalf, lending their power to the casting of certain lost, secret or forbidden magic. These invocations are described later. You gain two such wizardries at second level, and add another when you reach renegade wizard level five, seven, nine, twelve, fifteen and eighteen.

As with renegade wizard spells, you are able to discard one eldritch invocation for another each time you gain a new renegade wizard level. Level restrictions apply, of course.

**Gift of Servitude**

At third level, your mentor bestows a gift of service upon you. This is one adjunct equipment piece all sorcerers eventually employ – a techno-magical servant, amulet, or magical book.

**Techno-magical Servant**

As a reward for your loyalty, your mentor provides you with a permanent servant to assist you in your search for truth. This servant acts independently of you, although it usually obeys your commands. When in combat, your servant fights for you using everything it has to-hand. You communicate with this servant as you would with another mission ally.

If your other-planar mentor is _Llyánmàkchi_, the servant you gain is a Dweller in Shadow.

You must be extremely dutiful toward your gift servant, for should you get it killed no other will be offered to you. You can, however, dismiss your servant and your mentor will retrieve it until you invoke its presence again. This requires a short 10 minute ritual.

**Amulet**

Interestingly, all three other-planar mentors offer the exact same amulet, should you elect to receive this boon. They have not conferred on this; simply put, the Scarab exists in the possession of all three even though it is unique across all the Planes of Existence. You will have to learn its properties and attune yourself to it before it will function. Firstly, it serves as an enchanted weapon, but in the form of a beetle it acts as a skill tutor.

**Ancient Tome**

Your otherworldly mentor gifts you a grimoire that has been lost to all mankind for many thousands of years. There are many such (most were burned after humanity turned against sorcery following the fall of _Éngsvan hlá Gánga_), and the particular title of the opus you’ve been given depends on the being with whom you have a relationship.

**Énunanboté'a**

This tome, in accurate _Llyáni_, is titled “The End of All Beginnings”. Granted to you by _Llyánmàkchi_, this troubling work allows you to learn three Talent Magic abilities beyond the two already given on the renegade wizard class chart. Also, after taking a short rest to study _Enunanboté'a_, you may make an Arcana skill roll with a doubled proficiency bonus.

If you lose your _Enunanboté'a_, you are allowed to perform a 1 hour ritual to receive a replacement from _Llyánmàkchi_. This ceremony can be enacted during a rest, and it destroys the previous book. It is also destroyed the instant you die, melting into writhing and dissipating shadows.

**Púrohlan Znamrísha Kagékte**

This manual, written in the ancient _Bednálljan_ of the Court of Queen _Nayári_, is titled, “The Book of the Unnamed God”. Granted to you by the caprice of _Sarvodáya Di‛éla_, this work allows you to craft an amulet having three defensive spells enchanted into it that may be maintained without expending spell slots or counting against known spells. They are _Alarm_ (centred upon the amulet), _Blade Ward_, and _Resistance_. Also, after taking a short rest to study _Púrohlan Znamrísha Kagékte_, you may make a Research skill roll with a doubled proficiency bonus.

If you lose your _Púrohlan Znamrísha Kagékte_, you are allowed to perform a 1 hour ritual to receive a replacement from _Sarvodáya Di‛éla_. This ceremony can be completed during a rest, and it destroys the previous book. It is also destroyed the instant you die, fragmenting into flying shards of illusion.

**Chnéshaq khyChnéshayalu**

This mystic hymnal, written in Classical _Tsolyáni_, is titled “The Mystery of Mysteries”. Granted to you by The One Other, this puzzle causes your Spells Known and Invocations Known columns to ratchet upwards two ranks (i.e. at third level you have six spells instead of four and three invocations rather than two, and at nineteenth level you have sixteen spells and nine invocations).

If you lose your _Chnéshaq khyChnéshayalu_, you are allowed to perform a 1 hour ritual to receive a replacement from The One Other. This ceremony can be completed during a rest, and it destroys the previous book. It is also destroyed the instant you die, crumbling into dust in a matter of minutes.

**Ability Score Improvement**

When you reach fourth level, and again at eighth, twelfth, sixteenth, and nineteenth, you may elect to increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or to increase two ability scores by 1. As usual, you cannot raise an ability score above 20 using this feature.

**Deep Secret**

At eleventh level, your mentor teaches you a long lost sorcery now unavailable to the temples of the _Tlomitlányal_. Choose one from among these spells: _Mruóz's Contingency_, _Other-Planar Gate_, _Planar Ally_, _Suribáya’s Instant Summoning_, _True Seeing_. These incantations are draining, and you cannot cast two without first completing a long rest.

At thirteenth level, your mentor teaches you a spell from among these: _Etherealness_, _The House of Tranquillity_, _Symbol_, _Plane Shift_. Again, they are very draining.

At fifteenth level, your mentor teaches you one of the following: _Demi-plane_, _Maze_, _Power-Word Stun_. Draining.

At seventeenth level, your mentor teaches you a one of these two potencies: _Time Stop_, _Wish_. As above.

**Eldritch Mastery**

At twentieth level, your by-now long partnership with your mentor has taught you certain secrets that even your mentor did not intend for you to know. By concentrating on the energies suffusing the myriad Planes Beyond for 1 minute, all of your expended spell slots are restored to you. In effect, you have 8 spell slots instead of 4; but this feature cannot be repeated until you have finished a long rest.

**Other-planar Mentors**

The beings that serve as mentors for renegade wizards are mighty denizens of the Planes Beyond. Each has its own peculiarities and personality – _Llyánmàkchi_ is termed a demon, but in _Empire of the Petal Throne_ that means much more than some fiend from hell. _Sarvodáya Di‛éla_ is whimsical and given to sudden mood swings, but her awareness extends across many Planes and she may be very justified in behaving the way she does. _Tsolyánu’s_ religion is comprised of a pantheon of twenty gods of virtually equal power. Supposedly, they govern all reality, but there are hints that The One Other is the equal of all of them put together. Mentors like these know things, and do things, that affect entire Planes, not just the Imperium.

**Llyánmakchi**

Your mentor is a creature of legend, a lady of the demon realms. Mistress of a cluster of Planes of Existence, _Llyánmakchi_ controls the _Tsúghiyur_, the Ones Who Writhe and the Dwellers in Shadow. She serves no deity, and responds to the summons of good as well as evil sorcerers. Her concerns are beyond such things; she is not a devil or monster, nor a saint or celestial. She is ancient, calculating, cold, and unutterably alien. Partnership with her both expands and alters the renegade wizard’s consciousness.

**Dark One’s Blessing**

Starting at first level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you gain hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + your renegade wizard level (minimum 1) temporarily.

**Dark One’s Own Luck**

Starting at sixth level, you can call on _Llyánmakchi_ to alter fate in your favour. When you make ability rolls or saving throws, you may use this feature to add 1d10 points to your roll. You can do this after seeing the initial roll, but before any of the effects of the roll occurs.

Once you use this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before using it again.

**Third Circle Resilience**

Starting at tenth level, you can choose one damage type when you complete a rest. You gain resilience (resistance) to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature.

**Third Circle Visitation**

Starting at fourteenth level, when you hit anyone with an attack you can use this feature to teleport them to the Third Circle of the Demon Planes. The target disappears and reappears at the end of your next turn, having taken 10d10 psychic damage as it reels from its alien experience.

Once you employ this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

**Sarvodáya Di'éya**

Your mentor is an Undying Wizard. She belongs to a convocation of archmages at the College at the End of Time. There, the palace of _Avanthár_ stands under a great red sun and opens its doors to men, women, and others from across the Planes who’ve travelled from afar to discuss the issues affecting worlds, clusters of worlds, and entire universes. Gorgeous but hot-tempered _Sarvodáya_ walks with the lesser gods, but retains her human touch. She is a cruel and exacting mentor, but she does care for her wards.

**Expanded Spell List**

Spell Level Spells

1 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) Detect magic, Identify

2 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) Locate Object, Zone of Truth

4 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) Dimension Door, Polymorph

5 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) Geas, Mislead

**Sarvodáya’s Presence**

Starting at first level, your mentor bestows upon you an ability to project the beguiling but fearsome presence of _Sarvodáya Di'éla_. As an action, you’re able to cause all creatures in a 10-foot cube, with you as its centre, to make a Wisdom saving throw against your renegade wizard spell save DC. Any creatures failing this throw are immediately either (your choice): charmed, or frightened. This state lasts until the end of your next turn.

Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you’ve finished a rest.

**Sarvodáya’s Elusion**

Starting at sixth level, you can vanish in a flutter of light and shadow in response to harm. When you take damage, you may use your reaction to turn invisible and teleport up to 60 feet to a space visibly unoccupied. You remain invisible until the start of your next turn or until you attack or cast a spell.

Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you’ve completed a rest.

**Beguiling Defenses**

Starting at tenth level, your mentor teaches you to flip the mind-affecting magic of your enemies back at them. You are immune to being charmed, and when another creature tries to target you with any charm-like spell or ability, it finds itself charmed by you instead. You may, as a reaction, decline to resist the charm attempt with a saving throw, thus turning your enemy’s victory into defeat. See the spell or ability description for duration.

**Dark Delirium**

Starting at fourteenth level, you can plunge a foe into an illusionary realm. As an action, you choose a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. It must make a Wisdom saving throw against your renegade wizard spell save DC. On a failed throw, the target’s consciousness is transported into the Garden of Weeping Snows; there it suffers torment by _Sarvodáya’s_ master, the imprisoned demiurge _Nyélmu_ (doing 4d10 psychic damage). The target’s physical body remains immobile for 1 minute, and then the effect ends.

The Garden of Weeping Snows is a nightmarish place where madcap ministrants apply tortures to the spell’s victim. These ministrants appear to be human, for the most part.

You must finish a short or long rest before you employ this feature again.

**The One Other**

Your mentor is a Pariah God. It is a mysterious entity whose nature is utterly foreign to the fabric of reality (at least, that is the official narrative). As explained elsewhere, the religion that dominates all of _Tsolyánu_ states that the universe is overseen by two ‘families’ of gods, the _Tlomitlányal_ (the Lords of Glory), which is opposed by the _Tlokiri-qáluyal_ (the Masters of Shadow). The foundational scriptures of the religion, however, mention a single further deity who appears to assist nine of the gods in restraining the rebellious tenth, _Ksárul_. This extra deity is The One Other.

**Expanded Spell List**

Spell Level Spells

1 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) Chromatic Orb, Identify

2 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) Nystúl’s Magic Aura, Zone of Truth

3 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) Dispel Magic, Hypnotic Pattern

4 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) Dimension Door, Resilient Sphere

5 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) Legend Lore, Mislead

**Awakened Mind**

Starting at first level, you have advantage on all opposed Charisma checks, especially Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Perception, Performance, and Persuasion contests. Having been introduced to the tenets of The One Other, you are difficult to overawe. Additionally, you double your proficiency bonus when attempting a saving throw against any spell designed to entrance or beguile you.

**Grammarie of the Ancients**

Starting at sixth level, you gain the ability to use a short rest to identify the properties of any device of the Ancients. Additionally, you attune yourself to any 1 device requiring such, and are alerted to any curses placed upon it by hostile magic. Lastly, since _Biridlú_, _Hrá_, _Marashyálu_, _Ru'ún_, _Tsú'uru_, _Vorodlá_ and _Yéleth_ are creations of the Ancients, you gain the ability to charm any encountered for a duration of 1 minute.

**Thought Shield**

Starting at tenth level, your thoughts can’t be read by telepathy or other means without your consent. You also have resistance to psychic damage, and whenever a creature deals psychic damage to you, that creature takes psychic damage equal to that dealt to you.

**Divine Intervention**

Starting at fourteenth level, you can call upon The One Other to intervene on your behalf when your need is great. Petitioning The One Other for divine assistance requires an action. Agree upon realistic intervention options with your DM, then roll a 100 sided dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your renegade wizard level, The One Other is amenable to your request. The Dungeon Master is final arbiter of the aid given (the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate).

If The One Other intervenes, you can’t use this feature for 6 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.

At nineteenth level, your call for intervention by The One Other succeeds on a roll equal to or less than twice your renegade wizard level.

**Eldritch Invocations**

If an eldritch invocation has prerequisites, they’re required to be met before or the same time that the invocation is learned.

**Armor of Shadows**

You can cast Mage Armor on yourself whenever it is needed, without expending a spell slot or using material components.

**Ascendant Asseveration**

You gain proficiency in the Deception and Persua-sion skills.

**Ascendant Step**

_Prerequisite:_ ninth level

You can cast Levitate on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.

**Bewitching Whispers**

_Prerequisite:_ seventh level

You can cast Compulsion once, by expending a renegade wizard spell slot. You can’t do so again until you have finished a long rest.

**Book of Shadows**

_Prerequisite:_ third level

You can now inscribe sorcerous rituals into a spell book of your own. Choose any two of your 1 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) level spells, no matter whether they have the ritual tag or not, and transcribe them into your book. It will cost 100 gp for the book and rare materials needed for the process to work; it will take four hours to write down these first two spells. With your Book of Shadows in hand, you can cast all spells inscribed within as rituals (meaning they don’t ex-pend spell slots). These rituals, however, don’t get mentor assistance in their casting. As you advance in level you may add further spells to your Book of Shadows. You may even add spells that you have discovered or stolen, rather than mastered as a result of level increase. These spells must be no greater in level than half your level in the renegade wizard class (i.e., a sixteenth level renegade wizard can only inscribe 8 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) level spells). Notice also that your Book of Shadows contains spells, not eldritch invocations or deep secrets. These do not expend spell slots and also require the assistance of your mentor.

It takes two hours and 50gp per spell level of a spell you wish to transcribe (i.e., a 3 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) level spell requires 6 hours and 150gp).

**Breath of Akhoné**

You can cast False Life on yourself whenever it is needed, without expending a spell slot or material components.

**Chiriné’s Invigoration of Thews**

You gain proficiency in Acrobatics and Athletics skills.

**Dreadful Word**

_Prerequisite:_ seventh level

You can cast Confusion once using a renegade wizard spell slot. You must complete a long rest before doing so again.

**Eldritch Blast**

_Prerequisite:_ Agonizing Blast Talent Magic

Performing Agonizing Blast, add your Charisma modifier to the damage it deals on a hit.

**Enhanced Eldritch Blast**
