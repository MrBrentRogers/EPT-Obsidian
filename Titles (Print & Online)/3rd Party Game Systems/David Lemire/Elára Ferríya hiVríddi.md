_Skill Ranks:_

_Flame Lore_ 3

At three ranks of skill proficiency, Elára is an accomplished amateur at symbolic/syntactic magic and the theory underlying it. Classical Tsolyáni, a version predating that formalized by the priest Kánku Millíste of Tumíssa, is the lexicon used. Its letters represent sorcerously powerful concepts that can be manipulated by the sorcerer to create effects.

_Inner Flame Lore_ 3

At three ranks of skill proficiency, Elára adds control and suppression to the detection and measurement made possible by Flame Lore. It requires mastery of several disciplines – scroll writing, enchantment, potion creation – and a difficult initiation to qualify for Inner Flame Lore.

_Supernal Flame Lore_ 1

At one rank of skill proficiency, Elára has an initial mastery of the creation and destruction powers within her symbolic lexicon. Perhaps not permanently, she can create fire, heat, and light – or destroy it (even in such a way as to kill). Elára has given her oath never to reveal the secrets of Supernal Flame Lore, so she will only use her powers in total safety.

_Sense Foes_ 2

_Accession of the Glow of Lord Tkél_ is a fine ritual granting the celebrant the power to see or sense hostile intent. At two ranks of ritual proficiency, Elára can establish the target’s attitude, threat level, and Advantages such as Enhanced Dodge.

_Counterspell_ 2

_The Armor of Áinh Áing_ is an ancient ritual that all sects employ. It differs from most rituals in that it is designed to be reactive, and therefore fast. The mechanics are as follows: once Elára has detected that magic is being used against her, she rolls a Fire Lore skill check to ID the hostile spell, upon success she counters the incoming attack, adjusting her effective skill level with Autohypnosis, Mind Block, Mental ST or one of her body control skills as appropriate.

_Hide Thoughts_ 2

_The Shield of Jmár_ is a useful ritual that many sorcerers perform first thing every morning. A magician, having successfully performed this ritual, subtracts his level-of-success from spell cast checks (mind reading and mind control) by all opponents while the effect endures. _The Shield_ _of Jmár_ is a daily component of Elára’s Ritualism disadvantage.

_Hinder_ 4

_The Fetter of the Sun-Wheel Dancer_ is an insidious hex that reduces a target’s Move and Dodge by between 1 and 6 points. A 1 to 3 pnt reduction depends on the success check of the ritual, but also upon caster choice (Elára may choose to expend more Fatigue to increase the reduction). A 4 – 5 pnt reduction is a bit more difficult and costs a -1 to Elára’s spell success check. A 6 pnt reduction is even harder to do, causing a -2 to Elára’s check. These costs can be made up with greater ceremony and power sources external to the sorcerer’s Fatigue. This ritual fascinates Elára; she’s spent more time on this ritual than any other.

_Lend Energy_ 2

Using a version of the ephedra plant, _Hand of Haóma_ transfers points of Fatigue from caster to target. It’s a required ritual in the sorcery school she attends, and part of Elára’s daily Ritualism disadvantage.

_Sense Spirit_ 2

_Eyes of Urkaném_ is a basic ritual of Elára’s sorcery school. It’s a kind of radar for hlakmé, place spirits, minor demons, undead and other supernatural entities. The better the margin of success, the more information gained. Other skills, such as Area Knowledge, History, Research etc., can modify effective skill level for this ritual. This is yet another of Elára’s Ritualism items, but isn’t one that she uses every day.

_Control/Turn Undead_ 3

_Mouth of Urkaném_ is a basic operation of sorcery within Fasiítum. With this ritual, a magician controls the undead. The more recently an undead lich has been created, and the more familiar to the conjurer is that undead, the easier is it for it to be controlled. A -1 to ritual success checks applies if the target’s death occurred over ten days ago, -2 if thirty, -3 if a year, etc. For example, were Elára to conduct this ritual over the undead lich of some close friend, in the location of its death, with knowledge of the target’s Secret Name, her effective skill level with this ritual would be at +5. Also, the costs in energy to cast would be ¼ normal. Such is the power of magical correspondences. Some of this symbol ritual’s incantation is as follows:

_I hath mine mouth_

_Let me speak therewith_

_Let there be granted unto me_

_Broad-handedness in your presence_

_Because thou I knowest_

_Thy True Name(s) I knowest_

_By the bond of mine knowledge_

_Thou are puissant and so am I also puissant_

_Thou are abiding and so am I also abiding_

One apprehends in these words the inherent risk involved in controlling undead.
