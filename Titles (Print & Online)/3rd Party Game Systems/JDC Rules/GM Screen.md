**Instructions for Printing and Assembling Your Tekumel GM Screen**

#### Required Tools

Invisible tape

Six sheets of light card stock paper (have a few extra for mistakes)

##### Computer (MS Word) and printer

Step One

Open the document “GM Screen” with MSWord on your computer and wonder at the attention to detail, lack of typos, and usefulness of the charts. Ooh and Ahh as you please. Comment snidely that “I coulda done better’n _that_!”

Step Two

Insert seven sheets of card stock paper (this should be firm but flexible enough to make it through your printer). A nice sepia or other aged type paper looks very good.

Step Three

Print the document.

Step Four

Lay out six of the sheets in any order which is most pleasing to your eye and which makes the information readily available during play. This is your GM Screen, so have fun. Each sheet should make contact with the sheet(s) next to it. Keep the master creature list separate for quick reference, or add it into the screen, as you wish.

Step Five

Flip sheets three and four over so that the side with the printing on it is face down. Apply a strip of invisible tape along the join of sheets one and two, three and four, and again for five and six.

Step Six

Flip sheets three and four back over so that they are aligned with the rest of the sheets, then apply a strip of invisible tape along the join of sheets two and three and four and five. Your screen now folds inwards on the tape (accordion style) to make it smaller for easy transport.

**Step Seven (optional)**

Paste your favorite Tekumel graphics, pictures, or whatever to the blank side of the screen. This gives your players something nice to look at while their characters are dying horribly.

Step Eight

Get your players together and have some fun, you now have a six-fold GM Screen for your Tekumel game. Enjoy, and let me know what you think. If there’s anything you’d like to see added or removed in future revisions, or typos that need to fixed, just email me at [JosephCovert@juno.com](mailto:JosephCovert@juno.com). Include “Tekumel GM Screen” in your subject line so your email doesn’t get deleted as spam.

Future Improvements

A double-sided screen with GM information on one side and player info on the other.

A separate screen for combat. A separate screen with all the generation tables for any type of encounter.

A separate character generation and advancement screen.

Incorporation of additional sourcebooks and versions of the game into a more comprehensive screen. You will note the addition of some of the “new” eyes from Gardasiyal in the random eye table (the ones in _italics_). If you have any tables or other goodies and can send copies or scans I’d be most appreciative.

An adventure sheet with turn counters, PC party at-a-glance quick reference sheet, and XP tracker.

Notes

All information in this screen are taken from the Different Worlds Empire of the Petal Throne source book, and the TOME Gardasiyal boxed set source book. That’s about all I have, so if you have extras maybe we can make a deal. Some parts are self-explanatory but you still need the books and a good understanding of them to use the screen.
