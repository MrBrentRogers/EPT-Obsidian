**Introduction to the 2003 Edition**

Hello, and welcome to my version of Tekumel. This document contains the system I use for creating player characters. The rules are taken from the rulesbooks “Empire of the Petal Throne” (1987 Different Worlds Publishing) and “Adventures on Tekumel Part One: Growing Up on Tekumel” (1992 Theatre of the Mind Enterprises, Inc.). I’ve picked and chosen the parts that suit my game world and which (IMHO) makes the game more fun for my players. Since most of my players over the years were unfamiliar with Tekumel, the randomness of the process helped them flesh out their background. For advanced players who are familiar with the world, you can let them choose rather than roll for many of the sections below (e.g. birthplace, name and family details, religion, etc.). I hope you find something useful in here to share with your players. Enjoy, and many thanks to the good Professor for almost thirty years of fun. Any questions or comments are welcome at [JosephCovert@juno.com](mailto:JosephCovert@juno.com). All material trademarked and copyrighted by their respective owners.

These rules may be easily adapted for use in any published version of the various Tekumel RPGs. For example, to convert a character created with these rules to Gardasiyal, you simply need to calculate the HBS and rework your skills.

This list of tables may also be printed and assembled as a Player Reference Screen. See instructions in the GM Screen document for details.

Go to the last page (Step By Step Character Creation) and get started. If you get a really pathetic character check with your GM and see if you can roll up a new one.

**Step By Step Character Generation**

Have your character sheet in front of you, along with all of your favorite dice. Get a nice refreshing beverage, turn on some heroic music (I prefer _Thunderchild_ from the opera “War of the Worlds”), and prepare to be born. After you make your rolls record the results on the character sheet. Use pencil, especially if this is your first time. If you are an experienced Tekumel gamer, feel free to choose rather than roll for your birthplace, religious affiliation, etc.

Roll to find out the general type of place you come from (page 2), then if there is a table after that roll for the specific area.

Roll for your first name on the MALE (pages 3-5) or FEMALE (pages 5-6) tables.

Roll for your lineage name (pages 6-7).

Roll for your clan (pages 7-8).

Roll for your immediate family details (page 8).

Roll for your religious affiliation, height and build (page 9).

Roll for you eight statistics and fill in any bonuses or penalties (page 9).

Decide upon your profession based upon your statistics, then figure out your starting Hit Points (page 9).

Roll for your clan wealth, then calculate your personal wealth (page 9).

Roll for your background skills (page 10), then select those which appeal to you.

Roll for your professional skills (page 10). Your GM will provide you with a list of spells available to you.

Your GM will need to see your character sheet to calculate your HBS Factor and also the starting date of your campaign.

Congratulations, you’re done! See, you didn’t even have to suffer through acne and puberty.
