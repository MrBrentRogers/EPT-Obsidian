**Introduction**

Welcome to the final part of my home-brew rules system for use with the Tekumel role-playing game. This is not a complete game by itself, and you will need at least one of the currently available game systems to play. You may also find the other parts of my rules system useful. These include the documents “Character Creation”, “GM Screen”, “Spell Master” and “Underworld Adventure”, which should be available where you found this document. Here is a brief description of what these files contain.

Character Creation = rules for creating characters for use with any current Tekumel game system.

GM Screen = useful charts and tables for the GM.

Spell Master = an Excel spreadsheet which contains the entire body of spells from all systems.

Underworld Adventure = an Excell spreadsheet with a map and brief Underworld adventure for low-level characters.

It is my sincere hope that you enjoy my humble contribution to role-playing in the wonderful world created by Professor Barker. I certainly hope I haven’t infringed on any copyrights. My only intent has ever been to keep Tekumel alive and interesting for players old and new alike. Enjoy, and if you have feedback, suggestions or even complaints, feel free to write me at [JosephCovert@juno.com](mailto:JosephCovert@juno.com). If there’s enough interest and feedback, I may even expand all of these and combine them into one comprehensive home-brew rulesbook.

**Character Creation**

Your players should be able to complete most of their character creation with the rules in the Character Creation document. Once they have finished as much as they can, you will need to help them determine their starting skills and spells based upon their character class and religious affiliation. Judicious use of the document Spell Master will make this very easy. Obviously, first level characters may only learn first level spells.

Once skills and spells have been taken care of, you need to review your player’s character sheet and determine their HBS Factor. I prefer the Gardasiyal rules for this, but use what you’re most familiar with.

**Character Advancement**

This is the part your characters will be most interested in. This is what it’s all about, fame, fortune and power. Give out those experience points like they’re gold, be stingy and make your players earn every last one.

# Experience Point Requirements

First level characters use the tables in the Character Creation document. Upon attaining second level, consult the chart below. Hit points are added to current hit points (remember to add/subtract Con bonuses, if any), and the character gains Skills and Spells according to the charts following this one. Under the Special column, Citizenship is automatic at sixth level for humans, and land grants are possible at level seven and above according to the chances given (for non-humans, there is a 50% chance of Citizenship at sixth level, 75% at seventh and above, and a 25% chance of a land grant at the next level after they become citizens, increasing by 25% per level thereafter).

## Increase of Statistics

Upon attaining a new level, the character may attempt to increase a number of statistics equal to their level. To increase a statistic by 5%, the character must roll equal to or above their current score for that statistic. Statistics may exceed 100% through this method, but remember, sometimes you need to make a roll at half (or less) of your statistic to succeed.

## Additional Skills and Spells

Upon attaining a new level, characters receive the following skills and spells.

Upon first taking a skill, the character is assumed to now have a basic understanding of that skill. Skills may be raised. For example, taking Etiquette twice would give your character Etiquette 1. This means that whenever attempting to use the Etiquette skill, your character may add 1 to the roll. By taking any skill more than once, your character becomes proficient in the use of that skill. If a character ever has a skill ranking of 4 or greater, he/she is a master in that skill and may then teach that skill to other player characters.

If a character has learned all spells of a lower level, he/she may use any “earned spells” to learn higher level spells at a 2-1 rate. For example, Otranto, a fifth level Priest of Ksarul, has a total lifetime spell canon of 132 spells which he can learn. At fourth level he knows 13 first level spells (he rolled the maximum for his starting spells), 7 second level spells, 3 third level spells and 1 fourth level spells. He may now learn an additional first, second, 3 third, 2 fourth and 1 fifth level spells. Since there are no other first level spells he can learn, he could trade learning two first level spells for learning one additional spell of up to level five. Unfortunately, he doesn’t have two open low level spells to trade yet. Maybe next level.

Once a character has attained Citizenship, he/she may also learn spells one level higher from his/her Temple by rolling greater than or equal to the average of his/her Charisma and Comliness. This is, of course, very expensive.

**Styles of Mastery**

Every GM has their own style. Mine is a little wild and wahoo. I don’t make players worry about XP for their first four levels, I “promote” them via their role-playing ability. This works particularly well for groups like mine where I may get one player one day and another on a different day. Solo GM adventures can bring a character up to fifth level while also introducing them to the world and helping them flesh out their character conception. Once they reach fifth level, though, then the long hard climb to citizenship begins. Good role-playing and party dynamics are the things I reward most highly in my games. A player with a good concept of their character who can then role-play that character will not only become a citizen, but may even become a titled land-owner.

The important things to remember are…

1. It’s a game. We are all here to have fun.
2. Tekumel is YOUR world. If something happens on YOUR Tekumel that would not fit in with the Tekumel of Professor Barker, well, no big whoop. Don’t get hung up on “official” history or timelines. MY Tekumel would probably send the good Professor to an early grave. Who ever heard of entire cities being spacecraft that the current occupants don’t recognize? This is NOT official Tekumel, and I hope to keep it that way.
3. Problem players deserve to be slapped down ASAP. Don’t be afraid to be the bad guy. You are their character’s god. Gods are notoriously cruel. Enjoy.
