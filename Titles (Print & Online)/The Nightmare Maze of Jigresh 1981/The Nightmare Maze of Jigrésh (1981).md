The Nightmare Maze of Jigrésh, dungeon adventure for Empire of the Petal Throne, by Michael E. Mayeau, art by Ken Simpson, Judges Guild, 1981.

The Maze Temple of Jigrésh is well hidden within a confusing series of misdirecting corridors guarded by the Legions of the Despairing Dead. Jigrésh believed he could trick the demon lord Tkél into building a temple dedicated to Sárku, but the demon reworked the maze so that even Sárku’s worshippers would become lost and perish.

The dungeon is full of undead Jájgi, Mrúr, Shédra and Hrá, but the real horror is the map. The author states “I had created a dungeon the like I’ve never seen before (and hope never to go in as a player).” I haven’t wanted to be on the DM side of the screen with that map either, so I have never tried to run this adventure despite owning it for years.

Jeff Rients probably said it best:

*Just looking at this map makes my balls hurt.*
