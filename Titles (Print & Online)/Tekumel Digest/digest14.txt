Greets.  I have some questions concerning Tekumel for the digest.
1. Are there mountains in the Chakas?  The Man of Gold says so, and
I have seen it mentioned in one other place somewhere in the rules, but
the maps don't show any evidence of a mountain range or even individual
peaks inside the forest.  Getting real technical, it would appear that
the Chaka region could be a collision between hypothetical Mu'ugalavyani
and Tsolyani tectonic plates.  If so, that would explain mountains nicely
and might be predictive of earthquakes, but I would guess the Chakan
range to be weathered and more stable--like the Adirondacks.

2. What is the status of non-humans and clans?  I would assume that Pe Choi
and Pachi Lei would join human clans as a matter of course if they lived
in the Five Empires.  How common are non-human clan members?  Are there
real clans in the Five Empires consisting of non-humans?  My players find
Pe Choi characters irresistable and I would like some guidance as to how
they fit socially.  Also, I would expect that non-humans, regardless of
talent, tend not to reach the highest levels of human society.

3. While I'm on the subject of Pe Choi, do they have their own sorcerers,
living in the forests?  I would guess that under S&G rules, they would
be shamans rather than sorcerers.

4. How strong are the bad feelings between Ahoggya and Shen?  Do all
members of these races automatically feel antipathy toward one another,
or might individuals be capable of overcoming the feud (a la Gimli and
Legolas)?  specific example--if a PC is playing an Ahoggya, and he is
faced with a Shen foe, would the PC be able to cooperate with the Shen
if it were absolutely necessary; or if battling a Shen, would the
Ahoggya pursue even if it looked suicidal?  PC's should be able to make
their own decisions, but I know what Ahoggya soldiers are like when
confronted with Shen.

Sorry I don't have more creative contributions at present, but these
questions may help to keep the digest ball rolling.

Umm, I'm a bit ashamed to admit this, but it's been so long since I've
played EPT that I'm not up to speed with what form the game is in now.
I had the old TSR EPT rules and the Zocchi sourcebook.  What happened
after that?  What later editions are there?  Supplements?  Anything still
in print (besides the new Book of Ebon Bindings, which I've seen recently
at my local store)?  Let me know.

These are my answers to your questions, which by no means (except my quote
of the Sourcebook) should be necessarily construed as "official".

> 1. Are there mountains in the Chakas?

If Man of Gold says so, then my guess would be "yes". Can you find
where in the rules it says? I don't recall specifically where it might be?

The Sourcebook says "Occasionally a nonhuman who lives in one of the Five Empires
may join a human clan for purely pragmatic reasons (e.g. he wishes to
practice the clan's profession). These, however, are limited to the
Pe Choi, the Pachi Lei, the Swamp Folk, and rarely the Pygmy Folk.
The other races do not seek clan membership. If they wish to work at a craft,
they restrict their sales to others of their own species, and this is winked at
by the human clans."

As far as nonhuman clans, there are none, but Shen egg-groups serve a similar
purpose. 

The Pe Choi, Pachi Lei, and Swamp Folk all enjoy human society and are
generally accepted by humans. They participate in clans, temples, legions, 
and administration.

Since the Pe Choi are very magical, yes, they have their own sorcerers.
I can't find any reference in the Sourcebook, but I think that since
the Pe Choi are "civilized" in their native area, that their sorcerers
are probably of similar ilk to the humans: magic is based around their
two deities, the Father of Nests and the Black Old One. They probably
have spells similar to the humans, plus some known only to them, similar
to Temple spells, or the Tinaliya spells, described in the Imperial
Courier.

It is certainly possible that they function like shaman, but I don't think
so.

I think the enmity between these races goes beyond the level of dislike
between elves and dwarves in Tolkien. Gimli and Legolas mistrusted each other
and elves and dwarves in general have nothing to do with each other,
but they didn't hate each other to the core of their beings, like Shen and Ahoggya
do. In your examples, I'd say it would be very difficult, but perhaps not
impossible, for cooperation if Absolutely Necessary. I can easily see
an Ahoggya or Shen attacking the other, even if suicidal.
