Subject: Man of Gold

Considering that Vridekka knows where the Man of Gold is, I don't find it hard 
to belive that its no longer functioning.

Even if he couldn't figure out how to turn it off, there are other more drastic
but effective ways of rendering it inoperative. I have used the Hands of Kraa
the Mighty on both animate and inanimate targets and it usually makes quite
a satisfactory mess.  Even something so (comparitively) common an item as an
Excellent Ruby Eye would probably interfer with its operations.  And of 
course there are spells which hinder or block sorcerous activity.  This is 
also not including some of the spells which are employed by the Priests of 
Ksarul to make use of ancient devices and if they have been used there is 
no telling what the Man of Gold may be doing now.

Subject: Aquatic Ahoggya

Ok, this may get technical, hope you don't get bored.
Ahoggya are "rigid" beings, that is they don't have much flexibility in that 
they have no neck, waist or backbone. They are in effect walking torsos.
While the 4 "faces" make up for not having a head on neck on land this would 
make for a disadvantage in water.  Also consider that Ahoggya are going to have
a large problem breathing if they are swimming.  Their mouth and nose are 
placed on the "face" below the eyes, sort of like if your nose was in your 
lower chest.  With their arms located above their eyes they must effectively 
keep one half to two thirds of their bodies out of the water to keep their
breathing organs in the air.  Ever try to keep your entire chest out of the 
water while swimming? Try it, you CAN'T, unless you happen to be standing
on something.  Also with their bowed legs and heavy claws, they would float 
in a vertical position, so unless an Ahoggya gets a snorkel, they won't last
too long in deep water.  Even if one managed to get into a "laying down"
position, the lack of a head on a neck means that it wouldn't be able
to see where it was going, and two arms and legs are going to be suspended
out of the water, imparing any type of swimming skills it may have.  It 
would likely end up as a snack for a passing Akho.  
With the body arrangement that Ahoggya have, they probably almost never go
into a horizontal position.  Ever seen a cow or an elephant laying on its 
side unless it was dead or dying?  They have alot of trouble getting back
into a standing position unless their legs are kept underneath them.
With the arrangement of their legs (sort of bowed and crooked under) Ahoggya
that went horizontal would have a problem standing up without help.
They don't have a waist or back to bend at so they'd have to actually just
shove themselves upright using only 2 arms (the others wouldn't reach the 
ground, I think) or find something to grab and pull themselves up.
The arm/leg arrangement would also make it hard for Ahoggya to climb ladders
or steep stairs, and they don't seem to be able to look up without moving
their whole bodies (lowering two legs to elevate a set of eyes). 
An Ahoggya that wanted to "sit" would most likely just lower itself to the 
ground.
In effect, its my opinion that Ahoggya are about as bouyant as lead and one 
that fell overboard would sink like a stone.  They do, however have ships.
They are described as roundish, tub-like vessels, most likely with a shallow
draft (to get back into the swamps) and probably don't go far from shore.
Ahoggya that go into deep water are either very brave or very stupid (or 
both), and if you wanted to be a pirate, why not wait for the ships to dock
and just steal it then? (The Ahoggya marketplaces are practically pirates
dens anyway. .  .).
This is all my own speculation of course, and if someone would care to send
this to prof. Barker (blatant hint) to see what he has to say it would be
most appreciated.
