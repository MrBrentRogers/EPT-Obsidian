Subject: Names

I've found a name generator that works extremely well at creating
Tsolyani/Tekumeli names. It uses an input file of suitable example
words, figures the patterns and generates similar words. My
input file consists of about 550 words I've gleaned from many
sources, including the novels, the sourcebook, the language grammer,
etc.

Much better than Barker's "Tsolyani Without Tears" article method.

Here is a sample run (no editing out of bad names):

I got mine from wuarchive.wustl.edu [128.252.135.4], but
check the intro message for comp.sources.misc for the
archive site nearest you. This intro also lists uucp
archive sites and email servers that will have this.
Please don't ask me to mail it to people. I don't have the time.

If someone wants my word list after getting the software,
drop me a line.
