The following are a list of your questions, and answers by Professor Barker.

To say that Heroes of the age fought agents of the Pariah Gods is a
tautological statement.  That's pretty much what the Heroes of the Age
are for.  In other words, they won't appear to settle political disputes, or
even to prevent Origob from flipping over a continent.  The Heroes of the Age
are agents of the Pavar Deities who hold sway over Tekumel's multiverse, and
thus serve their interests.  This team of sentients must unite, must merge
completely, in order to defeat the Pariah Gods.

Magic would work exactly as well as it works for us!

Strangely enough, this climax was not dependent upon the Shards.  BOTH Shards
may have been authentic.  The resolution of the conflict was not dependent
upon the Shards, but upon the decisions made by the individuals involved.

No, if the mission had failed, Tekumel would have been destroyed or subjugated
by the Pariah Deities.  It was simply a Pyrrhic victory.

Not really.  Psychic spells are usually simpler:  they don't involve the
shaping or direction of force in any sophisticated manner.  More complex
spells or spells which involve a lot of shaping of forces and energy will
require more ritual.

Oh, very bad.  This is a very dangerous line of speculation for even the
mightiest of wizards.

Wouldn't you like to know (evil leer).

Wouldn't you like to know (evil leer).

>What is the Egg of the World?

It is apparently an ancient item, older than the Time of Darkness, which is
an analog of the pocket dimension in which Tekumel finds itself.  It is
extremely powerful and extremely dangerous.

>What is the role of deities in Tekumel?  What is the role of the Pariah
>deities and their relationship to the Pavar Pantheon?

The Pariah deities (the One Who Is, the One Other, and the Goddess of the
Pale Bone) are not all bad, just as the Pavar deities are not all good. 
Their roles are up to them to determine, but at times the One Other has
leagued with the Pavar deities against the other two Pariah gods, and the One
Who Is is a self-centered and self- absorbed god who can rarely be roused to
involve itself in the universe.  The Goddess of the Pale Bone is the closest
to an all-around baddie, but she's just hungry.

>What are the pylons?

The pylons are part of the inter-planar cosmostructure, landmarks between
distant planes.  They mark off certain areas.  They are not obstacles, but
they are often referred to as such because the distances one must cross to
reach them are, in fact, obstacles.  So to say "I penetrated beyond the 39'th
pylon" does not mean that the pylon was trying to stop you, just that you went
a very great distance.

>Who are the Silver Suits and why do they battle so hard to get in through the
>pylons?

Again, they're not trying to get in "through" the pylons.  They are an
interplanar race which accomplishes all their ends through technology, and not
magic.  They have been seen, they have killed and been killed, but one has
never been captured, and they have never set foot on Tekumel, so not much is
known about them.

>Why is the existence of Avanthar crucial to the continued existence of
>Tekumel?

Avathar is a permanent tectonic point in the cosmostructure.  It is a primary
force line for the structure of Tekumel's universe, and has opposites and
conjuncts elsewhere on the planet.  For instance, the Unstraightened City is
another such point.
  
>What is the significance of the College at the End of Time?

Avanthar is present at the College at the End of Time because it is the last
such point which humans inhabit in possibilty-stream of Tekumel's timeline. 
It is the last nodal point on Tekumel.  If you think of the infinite multiverse
which makes up Tekumel, it looks a bit like a tree:  mostly straight until the
Time of Darkness, then blossoming with possibilities in all directions.  Some
taper away to the "ends of branches", while many continue a "straight" course
to the top of the tree.  "Branches" are what happens when a universe takes an
unlikely turn, and the "ends" are when these unlikelinesses either result in a
destroyed or inconsistent universe.  The "trunk" is where most of Tekumel is:
the variety of things which occur are within an general area of "likelihood".

For instance, I hold a stone:  I could drop it now, or drop it in three
seconds.  Neither circumstance is very different, and both result in the stone
on the same place on the ground.  Or the stone possibly turns into a giant
demon and eats me and my family.  Now that's unlikely, and it makes a branch.
If the demon eats the universe, it makes an end.  If the demon is destroyed
and the world goes on, eventually the existence of me and my family will make
little difference, the branch will have returned to the "trunk".

>What role do the Undying Wizards play in the universe?

Undying Wizards like Thomar and Subadim are supposed to maintain the Universe.
They defend against the Pariah Deities, and any other force which threatens
destruction.  There are some Undying Wizards, like Torasu and Thuken, who
dismiss this responsibility, preferring instead to enjoy their power and work
their wills up and down the cosmos.

>Is it true that the Mihalli can travel from Tekumel's universe to our own?

No.

>Who are Gidj and Sons?  How and why do they trade across time?

Gidj and Sons are an interplanar mercantile corporation.  They do not so much
trade across time as across planes.  They are entirely clandestine, and only
have a permanent shop in the city of Dlash in Livyanu.  They occassionally hold
secret auctions where literally anything can be purchased.  But they don't
except cash, Visa, OR American Express.

>Why are the Livyani so secretive.  What is inside Dlash?

Read my next novel (evil leer).

>4.  Why is not Fu Shi'i's identity and that of his masters a mystery?
>Presumably Mr. Alberti has either discovered these and considers them
>unimportant, or Fu Shi'i is of less consequence than I believe.

Bob replies:
Somewhere there has been a misunderstanding:  Fu Shi'i's identity IS a mystery,
and one I would like dearly to solve.  However, Fu Shi'i's identity does not
yet rank on the level of question with "What is the Egg of the World", so it
wasn't in my list.  When he achieves Undying Wizard status (if he lives that
long, and he won't if I have any say in the matter), then he will be THAT
important.  Presently he is the single common factor to all of Tsolyanu's
troubles, and the master of both Dhich'une and Ald.

>6.  Where is the hobbit from, pray tell?

A woman attending a gaming convention during the late Seventies announced 
that during the course of her campaign a dragon and a pair of hobbits
had been translated into Tekumel via Nexus point.  Rather than be rude and
tell her that (like the Nexus point in Raymond Feist's books) this simply
wasn't possible, she was simply told "Yes, right, and they're in the Jakalla
zoo".  So there they are.  The hobbits are considered accursed freaks, but
friendly enough for all that.  The dragon is considered a Sro with some magical
ability.  The Emperor Hirkane once considered movingthem to the zoo at Avanthar
but never got around to it.

>The enmity between Ahoggya and Shen stems from an incident in the reign of

This is true, but it's important to keep in mind that the enmity between the
Ahoggya and the Shen is a NATURAL enmity, and goes back to when both were
spacefaring races using Tekumel as a resort.  They are Cats and Dogs to each
other, and their basic natures will make them abrade upon each other.  It is
accurate to say that the Shen are like nails on a chalkboard to the Ahoggya,
and vice-versa.

To the individuals holding the conversation, the Hokun were mysterious and
mighty enough to seem plausible masters for Fu Shi'i.  To anyone who knows
both, mastery of either one by the other is unlikely.  Even Fu Shi'i's mastery
of the Mihalli was only possible with technomagical augmentation of his powers.

>Re: TeX and Metafont.  Does anyone know of Metafont versions of the

There is a fellow here in Minneapolis who is working on a Tekumel font.  When
it is ready, the folks here will be the first to know.
