Now that the school year has begun, I'm hoping that submissions to
the digest will increase.  Remember, this digest is only as good as the
submissions to it. So, dust off that translation of EPT to your
favorite system, or those characters who have survived the trials of
the Underworld. Share your fiendish plottings of Prince Dhichune
or reports from the fronts in the war.  Come on! Let's submit!

Subject: Tekumel novels

Hello all,

Anybody have any info on the two published novels? Publisher? Still in
print? Prices? Possible sources? Brief review/synopsis or comment on
quality? I haven't seen either in the local bookstores.

Thanks for any help.

Both were published by DAW books. I'm not sure if they are still in print,
but you should be able to find them at science fiction specialty bookstores
and used bookstores.  The local SF bookstore has them in their used section,
though I don't know if they have them new. I believe they are about $3.95.

"Man of Gold" follows the adventures of Harsan, a scholar-priest of Thumis,
who is called to study some Llyani artifacts having to do with the mysterious
Man of Gold, perhaps a weapon of some sort. Intrigues and politics involving
the highest in the land follow, culminating in a trip to the Underworld
looking for the Man of Gold.

I found this book to be good from the standpoint of plot and characters, though,
understandably, much time is spent explaining things. Reading about the various 
aspects and personalities of Tekumel  was lots of fun, and anyone who is 
interested in Tekumel should read it. For someone who is unfamiliar with 
Tekumel, it may not work as well, but it might also interest them in the game 
aspect.

"Flamesong" spends less time on familiarizing readers with Tekumel, and is 
better written on the whole.  It is a far-flung tale that goes half way 
around the planet and back again, following the adventures of a Tsolyani 
platoon leader trying to bring an important prisoner to his superiors. Again, 
politics and intrigue, Barker's long suits, play a pivotal role. Very good. 
I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys fantasy fiction.

If you are starting a new Tekumel campaign, I'd require these books for
anyone in your group who is unfamiliar with Tekumel.
