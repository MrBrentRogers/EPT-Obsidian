>From: Bob Dushay <DUSHAY@NYSPI.BITNET>
>Subject: Comments on Swords and Glory Rules


>Keith, it's good to have the journal up and running again.
>Stick with the more frequent format.  A monthly format
>is really only workable if you have the discipline to
>be sure not to miss an issue.



>Rob Smith gave an excellent critique of the Swords & Glory rules.
>I can't resist sticking my oar in as a sometime user.

>   I agree with Rob's three major points: combat is unworkably
>slow, the spells are too complex without constant access to
>the rules book, and there are too many tables covering too
>many unique actions.  A simplified, faster moving system would
>be much appreciated.  However, there are many features of
>S&G that I think should be retained in an updated version.
>Of course, this is heavily dependent on the type of game
>one wants to run.  A D&D-style game, with lots of magic and
>lots of combat would not use the same system as a more "realistic"
>feeling game.
>   I play D&D most of the time that I play anything.  It has
>big advantages: the rules are well known by most participants
>which speeds play, and combat is fast and furious.  It's easy
>to score hits on monsters, and it's easy enough to retreat
>if an opponent proves too much for you: instant death is rare.
>On the other hand, when I tried a D&D approach for Tekumel (I
>did submit my rules to the digest a long time ago) I found the
>system just didn't sit well with my feel for the world: big
>bruisers shouldn't find it easy to laugh off a legion of low-
>level soldiers and take them all on with only minor damage.
>(Imagine Conan confronted by a Semetl of the Legion of the
>Scales of Brown.  Now imagine your favorite character.  See
>a difference?)
>   S&G's combat rules, in abstract, provided a very realistic
>feel.  Experienced warriors could cut down weak opponents easily,
>but a lucky shot from a foe could cause serious damage.  There
>would be no Conan-style heroics!  In practice, however, the
>rules don't flow nearly so smoothly.  My experience was that combat
>was way too slow, in part because of looking up tables, and in
>part because it was so infrequent to actually see a hit!
>   My recommendation to speed combat is modest: first, make
>it easier to hit.  I figure evenly matched fighters should have
>about a 50% chance of getting a blow in per round, although I
>haven't tested this rate.  Second, use the polyhedral dice to
>score damage, like the D&D rules: say, table A for melee becomes
>1-4 points, B is 1-6, C is 1-8, and so forth.  This should speed
>up the melee while keeping a realistic feel.
>  The various skill rolls could also be a simple percentile die
>roll against the characteristic itself, with a simple progression
>to increase the difficulty: -10 for an easy task, -30 for a
>difficult one, etc.  One could also consider the Universal
>(something?) table used in the (gasp!) TSR's Marvel Superheros
>game: a simple universal table for nearly any contingency.  It
>works quickly and easily.

>   I can't report which rules I'm currently using because I'm
>not running a game at present.  (I am becoming a player very
>shortly in one.)  If I start again, I intend to try to modify
>Swords and Glory toward playability, which looks easier than
>trying to convert all of the stats from the newer Tekumel stuff
>into a different game system.  I know; I've tried.  I am looking
>forward to both a rewrite and the long delayed volume 3.
>   I am also interested in hearing about what rules other people
>use and the respective advantages and disadvantages.






I have to put in an appology here.  I accidentaly erased the address of the
sender on the following letter. Paul, if you could, please send me your
address.


>Hello again.

>     I thought  I would  take up  Robert  Smith's invitation  to write  in  and
>comment on what  I would  like to  see in  the new  Tekumel roleplaying  rules.
>Unlike Robert  I have  never seen  the S&G  rules so  I cannot  comment on  how
>desirable a cut-down  version of  these would  be but  I can  suggest what  the
>nature of the new rules should be.   Firstly however I should say that I  agree
>with a lot  of what  Robert had  to say.   I will  start my  comment with  some
>general points on  what I  (Paul Snow) think  roleplaying rules  should aim  to
>achieve and then move on to particular points relating to Tekumel.>>
>
>     Roleplaying rules  allow  gamers  to  play a  rolegame  within  an  agreed
>formalised structure that binds all play  to a shared definition of the  nature
>of reality.  I believe that gamers who enjoy playing games set on Tekumel do so
>because of the richly  detailed environment of the  world and the  accompanying
>exotic atmosphere of the _roleplaying_ of the  game.  Bearing this in mind  any
>game set on Tekumel has to have rules that recreate the laws of magic,  science
>and society that hold on Tekumel and which thus simulate life on Tekumel.   The
>rules also have to be sufficiently streamlined to be playable without intruding
>on gameplay in a way that breaks or spoils the roleplaying experience.  This is
?really just a re-statement of the  necessity for a balance between realism  and
>playability that is true in any game but  what I want to emphasise is that  the
>realism to be achieved is the reality  of life on Tekumel and that  playability
>is _most_  important  to  preserve  the rich  roleplaying  experience  that  is
>possible with Tekumel.  A Tekumel game running under the new rules should  have
>the same feel as one  that has been run without  any dice being rolled  because
>the implementation of the  new rules moderated by  dice should be so  intuitive
>and quick as to be totally unobtrusive.
>
>CHARTS / MAGIC
>     With these points in mind it is clear that _Chartitis_ is disastrous,  for
>combat or anything, as it formalises the  game into a succession of breaks  out
>of gameplay and  into librarianship  in order  to run the  game.   Even if  the
>charts are adding to the accuracy of the simulation of life on Tekumel this  is
>undesirable. With respect to  magic, it might  be the case  that the nature  of
>magic on Tekumel is that it is a baroquely convoluted process to master a spell
>but that doesn't mean that the rules are optimised if they recreate this. So  I
>agree with Robert here that a lot of streamlining seems in order.
>
>COMPLEXITY
>     I believe that hidden complexity in rules  systems is not a problem if  it
>does not intrude on gameplay.  Both RuneQuest and GURPS have pretty complicated
>game systems  but they  are both  fairly straightforward  in play  because  the
>complicated calculations have taken place in the pre-game stage.  So once  more
>I agree with Robert, a two sided character sheet should be able to hold all the
>necessary information  for routine  game play  ( and  perhaps a  two sided  ref
>sreen for  vital  facts/charts)  but I  am  happy  if the  attributes  on  the
>character sheet have been  calculated in non-trivial ways  to start with.   The
>caveat here of course is that the harder  it is to generate PCs, the harder  it
>is to generate NPCs.   The draft RQIV rules which  are floating around the  net
>have solved this by having a good PC/NPC generation system that is based on the
>expenditure of background points.  This has the strength that it is as easy  to
>generate experienced or veteran characters as novices.
>
>STANDARDISATION

>     I agree that game mechanics should be as standardised as possible but just
>as insisting on using only  d10s, d20s and d100  is unnecessary, it is  equally
>needless to insist  on only  one mechanism. I  suggest that  broad skills  that
>represent extended knowledge or actions are well covered by using rolls against
>skill on a multi-dice bell distribution with modifiers for difficulty. This  is
>also easy  to convert  into head-to-head  tasks when  characters confront  each
>other in a skill vs skill contest.   However, for combat or any situation  that
>is broken down  into many component  integer steps a  flat probability roll  is
>better.   This also  allows  a more  gradual  increase in  character  ability.
>Standardisation of  mechanic  within  single  gameplay  areas  (magic,  combat,
>Lore/knowledge  skills,   practical  skills)   is  a   necessity  but   equally
>differentiation of mechanic between the areas can help give individual feels to
>these areas. (I have seen people genuinely strongly arguing for this.)
>
>CHARACTER GENERATION
>     Several things to consider here, not  just the divide between the  options
>of a random and deliberate method. It may be desirable to have various  "power"
>levels at which to generate characters.  PCs may have characteristics which are
>generated such that the range, and  thus probably the average, is identical  to
>that of the  rest of  the population,  or they  might be  heroes whose  average
>characteristics put them in a range equal  to the top percentile of the  massed
>population.  So how heroic are the  characters? Do you choose or is this  set?
>As mentioned above any system for PCs will also have to produce NPCs so it just
>as well  be able  to produce  characters from  differing levels  of society  at
>different "experience" levels right from the start. (Non frp use of  experience
>there)

>DOING THINGS: EMPOWERING THE PCs
>     The present skills  generated in  Adventures On Tekumel  tend to  describe
>professional skills or knowledge skills that the characters have. This is  fine
>and understandable given the academic background  of both Prof. Barker and  the
>average Tekumel player. However, any game  system in addition to the  functions
>described above has to empower the adventurous PCs to be able to do things  and
>be heroic within the game.  The worst thing you can  tell a player is that  you
>can't do  that or  can't  try that  or  pause while  trying  to decide  how  to
>adjudicate the situation.  So  I think the game needs  more skills like   Jump,
>Run, Climb, Shadow, Sneak and other skills that enable characters to get on and
>_do_ things and _know_ that they can do (or try to do) these things in the game
>whenever they want.  As the rules currently stand (as far as I can tell)  there
>is no indication of the supposition that  characters can climb a wall or  climb
>out of a  pit unless they  have mountaineer. (I  know you can  always roll  vs.
>stats but I'd  rather enshrine these  base skills  in the game  and then  allow
>progression).
>     I want to make clear that professional/craft skills, lore skills and other
>knowledge skills  are  all vital  to  delineate character  knowledge  and  also
>Tekumelani society.   I'm not against  them but the  active "doing" skills  are
>vital as well.
>
>COMBAT
>     Absolutely vital to get right. But what sort of combat do we want? I  like
>the idea of fast and deadly so long as that deadliness is being applied to  the
>NPCs. It  is no  good  if a  novice  character grabs  his  sword and  goes  out
>searching for glory if he  then has his eye poked  out by the first peasant  he
>meets wielding  a pointed  stick. I  favour a  more cinematic  feel to  combat:
>Adventures of Robin Hood or Indiana Jones. Combat needs to feel deadly so  that
>the players always fear death and appreciate victory.  This can be supplied  by
>the possibilities of special or critical hits  but overall the odds have to  be
>slightly stacked  towards the  PCs.   I think  RQ combat  is a  good model  for
>combat. It has a good feel even if some of the rules are a bit odd in detail  (
>'til RQIV hits the shelf  of course).  Also magic  needs to be integrated  into
>combat in the right way.  Detailed combat probably leads to short melee rounds.
>How fast can spells be cast on this scale and how deadly are the effects?  Lots
>of magic in  combat is ok  so long  as it doesn't  devalue the fun  of being  a
>fighter.
>
>ALIEN RACES / ALIEN MAGIC
>     Even if core rules apply to  aristocrats from Tsolyanu the game  mechanics
>have to be flexible enough to allow easy expansion to other races. For strength
>it is easy to extend  the range above human to  take in say Ahoggya for  combat
>purposes.  However if strength is also being used in the rules to calculate the
>distance that you can jump then clearly the two may not scale in the same  way.
>By the way, _Just how far and high do  you think an ahoggya can jump_ ?   These
>sort of  things have  to be  considered and  the solution  may not  be  obvious
>without resorting to chartitis.
>     The question of magic for other  races is also interesting. What magic  do
>the Hluss use?  No player,  I would hope, is ever going  to play a Hluss so  do
>the rules for Hluss magic belong in "the  rules" or should the DM just make  it
>up?  What are the boundaries of the core rules before supplements getting  into
>the realms of "future suplements ...".
>
>WHAT NEXT: HELP
>     Well I have rambled  on enough by  now. What does  everyone else think?  I
>know that some of the subscribers to  this group are also deeply involved  with
>the current RuneQuest Renaissance.  So what advice  from that experience  would
>you pass  on to  the  potential Tekumel  Renaissance?   Henk  Langeveld,  Loren
>Miller, David Cheng? I know that you're out there!
>Paul Snow

  Whew!   Some great letters there.  These letters will also be sent on to
the rules design team.  I have heard that the rules are coming along nicely
and that there is a lot of re-work going on.  I am pretty sure that the spell
lists wil remain esentialy unchanged.  I personaly think that the diversity
of spells is one of the funnest (Umm funner? most funnest?) parts of the
game.  I always try to find new ways to use the old spells
A
there was one time when I hit an undead creature attacking us with a 
revivication.  Really pissed him off.

Anyway, work on other things goes well.  I spoke with Wes Postlethwaite
and the miniature sales are going well.  He is having someone design
air cars, lightning bringers, and some new Pe-Choi figures.

Untill next time. keep those letters coming!
