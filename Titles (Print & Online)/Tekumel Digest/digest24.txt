Administrivia:
Since eklektik.cs.pitt.edu is down until further notice, I decided
that the archives of this digest needed to be on more than one
machine. As you can see by the header, three new sites have been
added. If you need back issues of the Tekumel Digest, please get them
from the FTP sites, if possible.

Thank you for your cooperation.

                             S & G animal statistics

Subject: S & G animal statistics

The following is a set of Tekumeli animal statistics that I have
gleaned from various official and semi-official publications,
such as the Tomb Complex of Nereshanbo. These are not meant to
supercede those submitted to an earlier Digest, but to augment
them. You will notice that the list is hardly complete.

BTW, I am developing a set of animal statistics for GURPS. Those may be
the next thing I send, if I get them finished. I may send an incomplete
set, as I've done here.
