Subject:      Query

There having been so many events on Tekumel at present, I'd like some
information about MAR Barker's campaign (Is Bob Alberti listening?)

1. Could a timeline of recent events be made, starting with Flamesong
perhaps, and going to the present?  I'd like to know the months and years
of the big events currently going on.

2. What is the status of all known imperial heirs?  I thought most had
been killed by D'hichune, but most seem to still be alive from Bob A's
last message.  Additionally, does anybody know of the fate of the Imperial
heir who could have been discovered in the module "A Jakallan Intrigue"
written by Mark Pettigrew, published by Tekumel Games, and given a Barker
seal of approval?

3. I've been giving some thought to Ahoggya reproduction and the problem
of eight sexes.  Has Dr. Barker come up with any explanations yet, or
is this one of the "Mysteries of Tekumel"?  While I'm thinking of Ahoggyas
can they climb (with or without help)?  How are they at boating?  "Biter"
is interested in becoming a pirate, and I'm wondering if Ahoggyas make
good sailors in general.
