Subject: A selection from the Book of Ebon Bindings

Greetings.  I am Arjai hi Vaisoner, servant of Might K'Sarul Who Awaits in
Slumber and honored member of the Cloak of Azure Gems Clan.

I have been commanded by those in power to reveal to you this day the means
of invoking the demon Ru'utlanish, servant of the Mistress of Delights,
Emerald Dlamelish.  I caution you in advance that this is a dangerous act,
and even the knowledge I impart, removed from the ceremony itself, imperils
your existence on this and other planes.  No shame will befall you and none
will speak ill of you if you leave at this time.

The summoning of Ru'utlanesh is described in the Book of Ebon Bindings, and
is repeated here with the permission of the author of that book.

-----

     In a most secret apartment, preferably beneath a temple of the Dark Lady 
herself, her servitors prepare the way.  A chamber or cavern is constructed in 
the northern wall, and this is purified with a solution of two parts human 
blood to one part water, the latter being taken from a well in the earth which 
no human hand has touched.  Then the corners of the apartment are sprinkled 
with drops of black blood [venous blood?], and the seed of males is also 
released into these corners upon the floor.  The smaller chamber in the wall 
is treated likewise.  In the larger, outer chamber the diagramme of the Eye of 
the Emerald Lady is made upon the paving, for this pattern has much to commend 
it with the Lords of the Land of Qelem.  The pattern is made of powdered 
emerald or chalcedony mixed with white clay and touched with the Nmereng Stone 
[a ritual gem, probably green fire-opal].  Around this pattern is made 
another, titled the Protections of the Wise, done in red ochre, tallow, and 
the grease from a slain infant, and other substances which will be known to 
those who have the knowledge of the Arts.

     When these things are in readiness, all will repair to the larger 
chamber.  Those with the evocator -- or evocatress -- shall wear no garments, 
for mighty Ru'utlanesh hates aught which is woven and those items in which two 
things cross one another[?].  The Demon Lord loves the sight of rich gems and 
jewelry, however, and thus each male and female shall be decked in splendid 
ornaments:  ears, noses, hair, throat, wrists, ankles, and other organs shall 
be hung with gems, pendants, bracelets, coronets, and all manner of 
adornments.

     It is necessary to provide the Terror of Qelem with his sustenance.  
This is not easy, for his sacrifices must be young men and women who are in 
their adulthood but who have not cohabited with any person.  They must be 
perfect and clean of limb, the best which the Potter of All has fashioned.  
They must be beautiful of features, tall and slender, and of rich and ruddy 
[the meaning of the Engsvanyali word is not clear] hue.  For a great calling, 
the priestesses utilise six males and six females, although more or less may 
be used for greater or lesser purposes.  These sacrifices shall have the hair 
of their bodies removed, they shall be anointed in fine oils, and they are to 
be bound with fetters of silver (for great Ru'utlanesh despises iron, nor 
cares he overmuch for copper or bronze).  These persons are laid in pairs of 
two and two, one male and one female, in the northern part of the chamber, one 
in the centre in front of the smaller cavity constructed there in the wall, 
and one pair each at the sides, somewhat back from the first.  Thus it must 
be.

     At the appointed hour the evocator stands forth from those present.  If 
this be a man, then his ornaments are to be of emerald and turquoise and 
silver;  if a woman, then of emerald and lapis lazuli and fire-opal and 
silver.  The evocator shall step to the front of the diagramme of the Eye of 
the Emerald Lady and call out in a loud voice, "Let the way be opened unto 
might Qelem!  Let the Barrier Gods of the Nine Pylons be silent!  Let the 
Gates of Iron Fangs be made open!  Let the Names of the Guardians of the Path 
be said unto them!  Let there be a reaching unto far Qelem and an obeisance at 
the feet of the Lord who dwells beyond the Tenth Pylon, so that the One we 
seek may come forth unto us!"

     Then all of those present -- up to any number which the apartment can 
hold, so long as there are not exactly thirty-three persons, a number hateful 
to Demons -- shall begin the Litany of Summoning [in Bednalljan Salarvyani]:

     "Otulengba, all hail!  Otulengba, all glory!

     Victory upon the Night of Power!

     Mastery to the One Who Comes Forth!

     Eater of Entrails, One of Mouths, Famished One!

     We call unto you!  We supplicate you!  We serve you!

     Otulengba!  Great Ru'utlanesh!  Homage to your eternal power!"

     Let this chant begin slowly and dolefully.  Then let the leader thereof 
speed its tempo, over and over, in a low voice at first, then louder and then 
even greater, until it reaches a crescendo.  Let those who sing sway with 
their chanting, touching their bodies together, chanting and stamping their 
feet so that their anklets clash and ring.  Let all of this be done even while 
the evocator calls repeatedly upon the Demon Lord, as given above.

     It is a far passage unto the land of Qelem, and time is required for the 
calling.  None shall cease the chant, nor shall any person break it with a 
cough or sneeze or anything untoward.  Should this occur, let his fellows slay 
him at once, lest all be similarly taken.  In any case, such an accident will 
cause the ceremony to be broken off, and it cannot then be resumed that night.

     As the chant quickens, the darkness will pulsate strangely with its 
rhythm.  The little chamber in the northern wall will flicker and grow 
illumined, then dark, then pearly grey, then murky brown.  At last a greenness 
will flow forth into the room, filling it with coils like incense smoke, but 
with an odour which is acrid and dank and repugnant.  Still let the chanting 
be maintained without ceasing.

     Great Lord Ru'utlanesh will now become manifest in the cavity in the 
northern wall, as is attested by all who have attended these rites.  Hideous 
is his coming, for there is a sensation as of the release of one's sexual 
ecstasies, yet this is not so in reality.  Then there is a feeling of 
lassitude and a weariness which surpasses all wearinesses.  A yearning for 
surrender, as of a beloved who approaches her lover, shall come upon all, and 
many will sway and fall within the patterns, rolling rhythmically upon the 
paving stones.  The evocator, however, must be strong and steadfast in the 
forefront, maintaining the Litany of Summoning.

     Then the Demon Lord manifests himself fully.  There is a sound as of 
some stupendous beast breathing and also a sense of red lust and passion 
greater than one has ever known.  The eyes are blinded with fervour, and 
voluptuousness rises to an unbearable pitch, yet ever with an underlying 
threnody of horror just beyond the limit of one's brain.  None can describe it 
completely.  Only an experience of it can make it fully known, and it is not a 
condition which one cares to endure again.

     When the Mighty One is fully present, the evocator shall raise his left 
hand and indicate the pair of sacrifices upon the floor to the left.  There 
then occurs a flowing forth, and one will perceive many tiny scarlet mouths 
opening upon all parts of the Demon Lord's body.  There are no eyes, no face, 
but only a multitude of tiny sucking, mewling mouths.  These will touch and 
caress the offerings, leaving everywhere great red weals and bloody wounds.  
Yet the victims will know it not;  they will couple together and jerk and 
writhe in an ecstasy of pleasure.  The mouths of the Demon Lord will cover 
them entirely, and they will be engulfed.  Their limbs will raise and lower 
and tremble beneath the horrid carpet of mouths.  At length one will behold 
their flesh withering away and their bodily fluids emerging through raw and 
naked gashes in their skins.  The victims are deliquesced before one's eyes, 
and their substances are taken up into the being of Lord Ru'utlanesh.  At last 
nought is left but the bones and a wrinkled, shriveled shell.  A sight more 
horrid cannot be found.

     When the Demon Lord has finished with this pair of sacrifices, then 
shall the evocator signal to those who chant, and they shall become silent.  
Then the former shall perform the Hymn to the Night of the Soul, which 
provides sanction for the next act of the ceremony.  [This again seems to be 
taken from the "Scroll of Inimical Sendings," Canticle IV, Stanza 8-9; cf. 
above].

     "Feed upon the joy of life, feel its presence within your being!

     Go down unto the Pool of Misty Water in your Land of Qelem!

     Go forth into the forest of many branchings and seek your prey!

     For you are the hunter, and the hunt is all your rejoicing and glory!

     Beyond the ends of time do you dwell, and yours is the power forever!

     Feed upon what is offered here that we may worship you!

     For we serve you, O Master of Qelem, in the Darkness Which Shall Be!

     Let it be the Eternal Night of the Soul!"

     Then shall the second pair of sacrifices be offered similarly, being 
those placed to the northeast.  Those who chant shall now repeat over and over 
the Words of Power:  "Neshkolem, Vayunem, Hikotume."  These are the secret 
Names of the One of Mouths.

     When the second couple has been received, the paving will run with life-
fluids, and might Ru'utlanesh will leave their crumpled shells to return to 
his place.  Only now may the evocator speak of desires or boons to be 
requested, although, as has been said above, the priestesses of the Dark Lady 
make no such demands and are content only to worship.  If one must speak, then 
speak no words which are not in every way true, for the Lord shall know of it.  
Make no promises which cannot be kept;  call each thing by its real and secret 
name and not by those appelations used in the external world.  Only thus can 
it be done.

     Now those who perform the rites will again feel the surge of wild 
ecstasy and sensual joy which overcome all logic, reason, and the instincts of 
life itself.  It is impossible to resist, and all will enter into an orgy of 
indulgence.  Many will fall, unknowing and uncaring of what is done to their 
persons.  Again there will come a lassitude of satiety, and the party will 
arise and prostrate themselves before the Lord.  The evocator shall gesture 
with his right hand, and he shall say [in Bednalljan Salarvyani]:

     "Who has fed shall feed once more;

     Who has been worshiped shall rise again in majesty,

     Adored forever by those who serve, ever and ever eternally!

     Who has come forth shall rejoice at the repast,

     Who has satiated the Glorious One shall enjoy the ecstasy of service!

     Who has done obeisance shall be given the strength to enjoy again!

     Forever and for all time, perpetually and everlastingly!"

     Now will the Demon Lord move to seize upon the third couple.  Under the 
caressings of the mouths these shall rise to perform delights and abominations 
upon one another.  The lash of ecstasy will raise them to all the heights of 
pleasure.  As they do, so shall those who observe do likewise.  For the third 
sacrifice creates within the hearts of men and women the most powerful an 
undeniable of lusts which any human can experience.  Raw, naked, untrammeled 
and unleavened by reason or by pity, this emotion sweeps away all before it 
and ends at last in an exhaustion so profound that none can rise, nor speak, 
nor possess the strength to disentangle oneself from one's partners.  Now, 
also, is the time of greatest danger!  The lassitude of which I have spoken 
creates a deep and troublous sense of emptiness, of depression, and of unease.  
The vanity of existence and the meaninglessness of all human sentiments and 
endeavours rise before one's eyes, and all who are there must cry out in their 
grief and hopelessness.  Those who have strength have been known to slash at 
their own throats with bared nails or with the sharp edge of some ornament.  
Others swallow their tongues or attempt to strangle themselves, while some 
plead for the kind aid of a friend or lover in their yearning for self-
destruction.  It is in this fashion that the Lord of Qelem gains further 
servitors, for those who succeed in this death are translated directly into 
his bondage in the Land of Qelem.

     During this period the Great One shall slowly retreat within the cavity 
in the northern wall.  When the evocator and his party have regained their 
senses and their wills, they will behold the Demon Lord to be cone.  There is 
no need to end the ritual or to provide a means of dispelling this Lord, for 
he departs of himself.  None may leave the pattern while he is manifest, but 
once he has accepted the sacrifices and departed, it is safe for all to go.

Subject: EPT Literature List

This is a list of all of the published Tekumel related material that
I am aware of. I have not included any of the EPT miniatures that
were produced. I have also not included any references to articles
or imperial dispatches that were printed in various magazines.
 I would be interested in knowing about any additional
EPT material (and obtaining such, if possible!) Extremely high on my
want list would be the Swords & Glory DM guide, which was rumored
to exist in unpublished form.

Subject: re: EPT Literature List

Ah, Thanks for sending this. I'll make comments based on the materials
I'm familiar with.

> Netherworld Dungeon Construction Kit

This was not Tekumel-specific, but a general dungeon gaming aid. 

> Missum (Miniatures rules)
> The Tsolyani Language
> Citizenship Documents
> EPT Gamescience Reprint

These definately exist. Missum is similar to Qadardilokoi,
only simpler: a much smaller set of rules. The Tsolyani language
books are the grammer and English-Tsolyani/Tsolyani-English
dictionaries. It is essentially a linguistic treatment of
the language written by Barker.

> Timbuktu

This is a game about Africa published by Adventure Games, who
also published some of the Tekumel stuff. It has nothing to
do with Tekumel.

> The Armies of Tekumel Volume 3 Mu'ugalavya
> The Armies of Tekumel Volume 4 Salarvya
> The Armies of Tekumel Volume 5 Livyanu
> Miniatures of Tekumel Painting Guide

These do indeed exist. I have copies of them. They are not in
what I would call "professional" form. They never got the typeset
treatment of the other "Armies" books.

> The Imperial Dispatches Volume I

I've never heard of this, not seen any advertising copy on it. Where
is it from?

In addition, I have the following:

The Tsolyani Primer by Curtis Scott.
This is a set of lessons in the Tsolyani language. Much easier to learn
Tsolyani from than the books by Barker.

Since you mentioned the Gamescience reprint of EPT, I should mention the
Different Worlds reprint of the same, with color cover, and the Different
Worlds republication of the Sourcebook (in three volumes, though only two
have been published so far).

Also, to avoid flipping back and forth between two articles, I'll print
all the magazines that I know of:

The Tekumel Journal, no.1 - 2. 1977. Published by Imperium Publishing Comp.

The Imperial Military Journal: Vol. II, nos. 1-7. Fall 2358 AS - Spring 2361. (1980-1983)
  Published by the Thursday Night Group. (n.b. Vol II, No. 5 is mislabelled as another
  Vol. II, No. 4).
  
Journal of Tekumel Affairs, Vol III, nos. 1-5,9. Summer 2360 AS - Summer 2361. 
  (1982 - 1984). Published by the Thursday Night Group and, later, Tekumel Games.
  (n.b. Vol III, No. 2 was mislabelled as Vol. 2, No. 3.)

The Imperial Courier, Vol. 1, Nos. 1,3-6, Vol. 2, Nos. 1-2. August 1984 - Spring 1987.
  Published by Tekumel Games and Vol II, No. 2 by the Tekumel Consortium. (n.b.
  The dates on the covers are not when these actually were published. Some vary by as
  much as a year (late that is). )

I've never determined if the missing issues in the above list were ever published.
If someone can confirm or deny that these exist, I'd appreciate it.
