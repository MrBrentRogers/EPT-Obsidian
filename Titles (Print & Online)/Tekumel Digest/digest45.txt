Subject: Re: Tekumel Digest,

I pulled out some of my old DRAGON magazines last night,
and decided to make a list of the EPT related articles that
I could find in them. This list covers DRAGON magazines #1 to 26
and all issues of THE STRATEGIC REVIEW (precursor to THE DRAGON).

I notice that I found about twice as many items as were listed
in the "The Dragon Magazine Ultimate Article Index" for that period.

Strategic Review Volume 1 #4

      Tsolyani Names Without Tears, by M.A.R. Barker
      
Strategic Review #6

      War of Wizards Update, by John W. Berry
      War of Wizards Solitaire, by Richard L. Mataka
      
Strategic Review #7

      To The Everlasting Glory of the Petal Throne, by M.A.R. Barker

Dragon #4 (Special EPT Issue)

      Reports Submitted To The Petal Throne, by M.A.R. Barker
      Jakalla Encounters, by Steve Klein
      Ahoggya out fishing one Sunday morning (illustration), by Neil Healey
      The Battle of the Temple of Chanis: 2020 A.S., by M.A.R. Barker
      Creature Feature: The Mihalli
      Creature Feature: The Vriyagga
      Roads from Jakalla (fiction), by Jerry Westergaard
      Percentile Roll to Obtain an "Eye" as Treasure in EPT
      The Temple of Vimuhla (photographs of model)
      
Dragon #6

      Legions of the Petal Throne Painting Guide, by M.A.R. Barker
      
Dragon #7

      Military Formations of the Nations of the Universe, by M.A.R. Barker
      
Dragon #9

      Seal of the Imperium (rule and campaign discussions), by M.A.R. Barker
      
Dragon #11

      Seal of the Imperium (more rule and campaign discussions), by M.A.R. Barker
      
Dragon #17

      The Crs'tchen (variant monster parody that provoked a later
      outraged letter to the editor from a humor-impaired
      fundamentalist), by Dennis Chapman
      
Dragon #20

      Distributing Eyes and Amulets in EPT (random treasure tables),
      by Mike Crane
      
Dragon #24

      Naming People, Places & Things in Petal Throne (random name
      generator), by G. Arthur Rahman
      
Dragon #26

      Birth Tables and Social Status (random character background
      tables), by G. Arthur Rahman
      
That's all for now.
