Administrivia:
I will soon be losing my network access. I need someone to
take over the Tekumel Digest. I have software that helps
in administration, so it only takes about 5 minutes per week.
Any interested parties should contact me at the tekumel-request
address. Thank you.

Subject: Names List Offer

    Back in the Fall of '89, I began collecting names for use in stories and
games.  After 3 years of hard and and often painful work, I have collected
approximately 8,500 names for everyone to share and enjoy.

    Some of the names are real tongue-twisters.  Some are plain.
Some are interesting.  Many are unforgetable.  Here is an example of the first
6 lines of the B's.....

B'jan                Babette              Babs                 Babthorp
Bachylar             Bade                 Bader                Baduhildi
Baehloew             Baelraeth            Baeron               Baggins
Bagotby              Bagtruhe             Bahrair              Bailey
Bain                 Bairdo               Bairghith            Bakar
Baker                Bakster              Balain               Balbi

    The Names List is a _HUGE_ file.  It takes nearly 70K to store it.
It arrives in 7 parts, and will be labeled as to the order they go in.

    If you would like a copy, then write me at PARGWE@MOREKYPR.BITNET.
Please enclose alternative addresses (if possible).  I will try to send
the entire Names List within a week.  If you don't recieve the Names List,
then write me back.

    If you have any questions, --==**FLAMES**==--, or comments, feel free
to write me.
