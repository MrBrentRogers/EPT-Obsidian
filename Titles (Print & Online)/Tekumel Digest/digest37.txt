Subject: Tusmi dom masun, tlatsolyani, ne?

Ngangmuru,
 
For those of you interested in learning the Tsolyani language, I have good
news for you:  M.A.R. Barker's two volume description of the language is still
available.  A friend of mine owns a gaming store ordered the lexicon for me
from either Different Worlds or TOME, I am not sure which.  Regardless, he
placed the order with Chessex Distributors.  The two volume set costs $12.95
and includes a pronunciation guide, a complete grammar, a conversation guide
geared toward the traveller in Tsolyanu, English-Tsolyani/Tsolyani-English
vocabularies, and information on the script.
 
There is (or was) a set which included a cassette of spoken Tsolyani.  It
cost an additional dollar.  I specified that I would prefer that version, but
what came was the one sans cassette.  I suppose the version with the cassette
is no longer available.  If anyone out there has a copy of the cassette
please send me some mail.  I'd be very interested in obtaining a copy.
 
Brumazik,
 
Ramsey
