To the Tekumel Digest:

A while back I mentioned an EPT module in White Dwarf magazine.  I looked
it up and it was the "Temple of the Doomed Prince" by Phil Holmes in
White Dwarf #54, pp. 32-35.  It is also worthy of note because it includes
not only EPT stats for characters and monsters, but also stats in AD&D and
in RQII style.  It concerns "a temple to Ksarul locat(sorry, that should read
"Protectorate") in the year 2361.

Subject: Neophyte

I have recently been introduced to Tekumel and have been discovering an
incredible game system. I have started the sacred quest of locating 
Man of Gold and Flamesong. Someone earlier said it took them 3 years, I can
only pray it does not take me as long. I purchased the Book of Ebon Bindings
and read it. I have a few questions if you can forgive my newbieness.
  Will a demon give out the secret name of another demon? Or do they have
an understanding not to do this?                
  If someone has made a pact of protection and later another wizard tries
to send a demon to kill the protected individual, does the required sacrifice
skyrocket or does the demon refuse? I know this would depend on the individual
demons involved but an example would clarify things.

Subject: Ahoggya & Hla'ka

The discussion about the Ahoggya is very interesting. I have a few comments
(my 2 cents) in this area.        
  When I was taking swimming lessons as a child the first thing they taught
us was how to bob. Basically you hold your breath and sink until you hit
bottom and the push off the bottom as hard as you can. When you reach the
surface inhale and hold your breath again. You can keep this up for some time,
being the obsessive kid that I was I tried it to see how long I could do it.
The Ahoggya could keep this up a long time in shallow water, they're heavy
and sink well, they can hold their breath well. One in this position, if he
knew the direction of shore could slowly work his way to land. This is 
assuming not becoming fish food in the process.
  Their lackadaisical attitude is probably compensation for their weaknesses,
swimming, climbing. Their brute strength allows them to do many things but
they must overcome any fears, but with the laid back attitude, no problem.
  I'd like to start a discussion of Hla'ka. Their religous rituals are 
described as arranging stones at certain astrological events. This is not
done in a very serious manner and is accompanied with much badinage. Whole
Earth Review recently had an article on how to predict things like eclipses
by just arranging sticks and stones in your yard at dusk and moonset. This
method was fairly simple and somewhat accurate. The only requirement was
that it be done year round and in a flat area with a clear view of the horizon.
Obviously, the Hla'ka are accomplished astrologers with the simplest of tools.
  My question is : with their humourous attitudes, what purpose does it serve?
Could they wait for a certain event? When something astrologically significatn
happens, do they secretly aid Tekumel? Like for instance, say a double lunar
eclipse occurs (extremely rare), Nexus points open allowing Kasural (sp) and
his minions access to other planes. Could the Hla'ka prevent it by an
arrangment of magic stones in certain locations? Any other ideas?
