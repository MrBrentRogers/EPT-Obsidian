Subject: Tekumel miniatures?

I'm not on your mailing list since I haven't played EPT since '78 or so,
but a friend of mine recently asked me to check on the net about whether
any Tekumel miniatures are still in production or in stock anywhere or
failing that, if there is anyone with a collection to sell. So it seems
to me that you're the person to ask from the rec.games.frp FAQs postings,
etc.
So is there any way this guy can hope to get an army together?

Subject: Campaign Descriptions

This list needs some sparking up. We have 85 participants from
around the world (7 from the U.K., 3 from Australia, and 1 from
Denmark) and we can't even get one Digest a week! It seems like the
same people are active. 

I'd like to see people send in descriptions of what is going on in
their campaigns. Or even if you haven't convinced your friends to
play yet, how about some ideas for advetures?  Come on, folks.
This list can only be as good as you make it. I'll even start things:

Campaign Notes

When EPT first came out back in the mid '70s, I played in a campaign
GMed by Craig Smith, the artist who drew those very detailed drawings
of the non-humans in Swords and Glory, plus much other artwork throughout
the years. He was in Barker's own campaign, and his was a semi-official
branch of Barker's. We usually played Change followers, most often
Vimuhla worshippers. 

Our characters were on an ocean voyage, though I don't remember why 
(it's been a long time since then). We weren't just sailing along the 
coast, either.  I recall that a big storm blew us out into the middle 
of the ocean, away from the sight of land. I recall fighting an Akho, 
the Embracer of Ships, and a hive-ship of Hlyss. At one point, we came 
to an island with a bay and a few buildings. After anchoring at the pier, 
we went ashore and started looking around. Inside of the buildings, we 
found an extensive underground area that was inhabited by Ru'un. But 
these were no simple treasure guardians.  These were much more 
intelligent models, some with much more deadly weapons, such as some 
kind of energy projector, instead of the normal boltcaster.

After some strange comments from the Ru'un, such as "You been away for 
so long. We've been very worried. Now, come here and relax.", and the 
Ru'un's very servile attitude (they would bring us just about anything 
we wanted, including banquets, concubines (I think they were automata as 
well), and other entertainments, we asked some questions. We were told 
essentially that this was an military R & R base, (for the ancients, we 
presumed). We were to stay there until we got our new orders. Since the 
general staff had been dead for millenia, we were going to be staying 
there for a LONG time.

After picking up some nifty toys, we were able to escape to our ship. 
They didn't attack us directly, I guess because they weren't programmed
to harm the shore-leave parties.

We found out later (after some near-fatal incidents) that these items we 
had picked up were laser pistols (three of them, as I recall).

Underworld Adventure Idea

The temple of Ksarul (or Thumis) needs help in an expedition to the 
underworld to investigate a new First Imperium layer recently opened up.  
Research indicates that the lab of a famous sorcerer may have been found.  
If so, his crowning acheivement, a major magic device of great power, 
may be found.

A cave-in occurred two weeks ago (earthquake, magic, etc.) with another
party.  Many died in the falling rubble.  Preliminary investigation
revealed an long untraveled section with Engsvanyali period
architecture and art.  Not enough of the party remained to continue,
but now that the leaders have recovered and the temple has refunded
the expedition, they need people to help.  Bodyguards, mages,
scholars, even miners, manual laborers, etc.

Pay (handsomely) half now; half later, plus a cut in anything they
recover.

There, now I've started things rolling. Let's see some submissions!
