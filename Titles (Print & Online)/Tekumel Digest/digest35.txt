Subject: Hirkane's assassination

    Bob-
     OUCH!  YOW!  OOH!  Boy does it HURT to have someone see more clearly into
your own situation than oneself.  I refer to your comment "it is quite possible 
that the He'essa, 'Those who are seen yet not seen' had something to do with 
[the death of Hirkane]"  Your comment comes just as I have determined that the
"shape changers" that our gaming group thought we were dealing with are, in
fact, He'essa.
     Where you just put two and two together, I had to be bashed over the head
repeatedly before figuring it out (the rest of my group, not being K'Sarul
worshippers like myself :-}, haven't got a clue of course).  We're in 
Rereshqala's palace and are being literally swarmed by dopplegangers.  We've
had to establish a practice of exchanging personal items everytime we meet
because otherwise we get killed by creatures who look like our comrades.
The other day I managed to examine one captured (dead and revivified), and
when mind-scanned it dissolved into a pile of goo.  It also manifested a
major league nasty demon, so I didn't catch on right away, being too busy
chanting the Paean of Irshuketl (sp?) the Shackler to think.
     Now, your comment about the He'essa taking out Hirkane strikes home:
Dhich'une's consorted with the Goddess of the Pale Bone before, and sure
enough I think you've got it.  Either the Man of Gold has been turned off,
or been circumvented.
     If we can get some solid evidence of Dhich'une's alliance (which could
be difficult -- they don't often come labelled "He'essa.  Property of
Dhich'une.  Return postage guaranteed"), we could almost certainly rally
all the Stability and a good portion of the Change temples against him.

     By the way, several requests have come in with questions concerning
the status of Barker's group.  I've been putting those together and will
try to answer them after the game this Thursday.
