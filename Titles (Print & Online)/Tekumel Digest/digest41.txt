Subject: Ahoggya at sea

From: Curtis M  Scott <cms@mse.cmu.edu>

In my Tekumel campaign (which means this is NOT official canon), Ahoggya
cannot swim. They float like a rock, in fact. However, they are bottom
walkers, and can hold their breath for several minutes. In the ocean, this
wouldn't do them much good, as they can't hold their breath for days, but in
the swamps of Haida Pakala they are well known for 10-15 minute jaunts along
the bottoms of the bayous. (A funny campaign bit is to have the Ahoggya
agree to take some human PCs somewhere, then get mad at them when they won't
walk with the Ahoggya along the bottom.) The swimming bladders feel wrong;
they seem like more equipment than most Ahoggya would bother with. Again,
this is just personal feel.

I agree with Brett about the rudeness and "humor" of Ahoggya. I don't
think their inability to swim would prevent them from sailing; it probably
wouldn't occur to them that dying was all that big a deal.

An issue raised by Bob Royer has to do with the availability of instruments.
Basically, since there are no "fixed stars" in Tekumel's sky, getting any
kind of celestial navigation going requires highly accurate timepieces --
which are also not available on Tekumel. Thus, the reason I have always used
for Tekumelani coastal sailing was the lack of Rennaisance-level navigation.
(Of course, as Bob points out, the Akho and other icky sea-monsters don't
help.)

As far as Ahoggya climbing, I've always maintained they couldn't. Their
central bodies are very massive when compared to their limbs, and even
though they're strong that's a lot of leverage (try climbing a ladder while
leaning backward -- then again, don't try it, you'll probably break your
neck). In the Ahoggya huts in Haida Pakala (again, local campaign), the
central holes have two ladders extending down. The Ahoggya stands between
them to climb up or down, providing support on two opposite sides. With
that much support, climbing seems possible.

Re the miniatures rules: There are three sets for Tekumel; of these, only
Qadardalikoi was credited to Professor Barker. (David Sutherland wrote
Legions of the Petal Throne, and Mike Mornard (I think) wrote Missum!).

However, one should note that there is a Phil Barker in England who is part of
the WRG group. According to Professor Barker, they're distant cousins of
one another, but so far as I know they've never met. They do correspond,
however, and I wouldn't put it past the British Phil Barker to put Tekumel
stuff in his less serious work.

Allow me to state authoritatively that Phil Barker, a resident of England, and
a big name at Wargames Research Group, and M.A.R. Barker, a resident of 
Minneapolis and a Professor of Linguistics (?), are _not_ the same person,
although they may be related.  I've seen pictures of Professor Barker, and I've
met WRG Barker at a wargaming convention last year which imported him.  Since
the Hordes of the Things rules include a phone number (_in England_) to call
him if you have questions, I'm confident that they are not the same person.

As to the notoriety of the Tekumel universe:  Well, I've been active in the
wargaming and role-playing gaming hobbies since about 1972 and 1976 respect-
ively.  It's been my experience that most old timer RPG players (say pre-1980)
have heard of Tekumel, and a large proportion of miniature wargamers were
involved in the early rpgs.  So, I think that it's not as uncommon as Bob
seems to think.  I'd agree that it's more unusual to meet a recent convert 
to rpgs who's familiar with Tekumel.  Miniature gamers' interest in Tekumel
has been kept up by the publication of three different sets of purely Tekumel
minaitures rules, as well as a manufacturing run of figures by some company
called "Old Guard" (or Old Glory, or something like that) around 1977.  Their
molds were later bought by Ral Partha, which released as expanded line 
including the armies of Mu'ugalavya around 1980, but these were only in 
production for a short time.  These were some of the best fantasy infantry ever
produced (IMHO), and I know other people who are looking hard for them.  The
former Ral Partha molds were sold again, and surfaced (with some additional
expansions) as a product of the Tekumel Games Company, from whom I bought a
number of Mu'ugalvyani troops by mail, as well as at Origins in Baltimore in
1985.  (I just ran across their catalog again yesterday.)  Tekumel Games was
responsible for the publication of a number of new products, like the two
adventure modules "A Jakallan Intrigue" and "The Tomb Complex of Nereshanbo".

     Anyway, back to the review of Hordes of the Things (Hott).  Hott is a set
of general purpose fantasy minaitures rules based on the popular Wargames 
Research Group (WRG) fast-play ancient and medieval rules De Bellis 
Antiquitatis (DBA), which have been sweeping through the miniatures gaming 
community during the last year and a half.  DBA is based on the premise that
ancient commanders had only minimal control over their troops, and that they
were not usually aware of the details of a unit's state of morale, casualties,
or level of exhaustion.  To a lesser extent, they did not worry about the 
formation of individual units either.  So, a DBA game is played with 12 stands
of troops (with 2-4 figures per stand) representing a unit.  Units in DBA are
of eight or nine types, and combat is resolved by the thorw of one die per unit,
with a plus for each side depending on the type of troops that they are 
fighting.  High roller wins, and the loser is destroyed if its opponent is one
of the types of troops that it is particularly vulnerable to (for example,
cavalry is vulnerable to archers), and pushed back a bit otherwise.  If one
side's roll+modifier is double the other side's roll+modifier, the low roller
is destroyed regardless of unit types.  One side loses in DBA when it has lost
the commander's stand, or four stands total, whichever comes first.

Hott takes this basic set of rules and modifies it for use in fantasy.  The
distinctions between historical troop types are reduced a bit (spears and
pikes become the same), and a group of fantasy troop types, such as gods,
dragons, wizards, heroes, paladins, clerics and flyers is added.  The resulting
rules are still quite short (about 6 pages, plus another 6 pages on how to
set up the armies and the battles, a 4 page set of miniature campaign rules,
and 16 pages of various fantasy army lists.)  We've only had them for a 
couple of weeks, but have played them quite a few times, since an individual
battle only takes an hour or less.  An EPT army is quite simple, since they
have no cavalry, and includes various units of spears, blades, shooters, and
barbarian warbands.  Brief suggestions on the methods of fitting in the various
non-human troops into their system are given.  The rules are a bit pricey in
the U.S. ($13.95 for a 40 page booklet), but quite a few people at Cold Wars,
the winter convention of the Historical Miniatures Gaming Society, held this
past weekend (6-8 March), alreayd had bought them, and people were selling
fantasy armies configured to Hott standards at the flea market tables.  This
would indicate a certain amount of general acceptance among that community,
especially given that the rules ahve been available for less than six weeks.
In the U.S., the rules are being imported by Wargames Inc, of Triadelphia
West Virginia.  If your local hobby dealer deals in miniatures at all, they
can probalby order it through the distribution system.  I think the Armory
is planning on carrying these rules, too.

I should also mention that fantasy armies are not automatically made of of 12
stands like the historical armies.  Fantasy armies are formed from 24 points,
with a stand of 'normal' troops being worth 2 points, a horde of useless
things (undead, goblins) worth 1 point, and most of the heroes, wizards and
the like worth 4 points.  My basic Mu'ugalvyani army might include 5 units
of blades (including the general), a wizard, 3 units of archers and 2 units
of N'lyss barbarian warbands.

Missum! was written by Gary Rudolph. Interestingly, both Missum! and
Qadardilokoi use the same unit strength designations, those given in
the Armies of Tekumel series. Missum! is a slim volume of rules,
whereas Qadardilokoi is much larger. Not being a miniatures gamer (and
never having played Qadardilokoi), I can't critique the pluses and 
minuses of each set of rules. Anybody out there wish to do so?
I'd like to see people submit reviews of Tekumel material, if anyone
thinks it would be at all helpful.

Was Qadardilokoi ever published in a format that wasn't printed on a
dot-matrix printer and photocopied? Or is my copy just pre-production?
Same question for the later Armies of Tekumel volumes. At least Missum! 
and the first two Armies are actually printed professionally.

Akho *                    (kraken)                   Embracer of Ships

ST: 7-20                Move/Dodge: 10/6#           Size: 50-500
DX: 13                  PD/DR: 4/6                  Weight: incredible
IQ: 3                   Damage: *
HT: 15/20-200           Reach: C-70                 Habitats: SW

Giant water beast with 20 tentacles and a single red eye. Acid saliva
does 1 HT per 2 seconds. Will attack the hull or the crew. They
sometimes swallow bright objects.  Can grapple with two tentacles per
turn and still defend. Each tentacle takes 1/5 of the hit points, but
does not affect total HP. Only cutting damage will sever a tentacle.
Against crew, tentacles will grapple, pull towards water, drown in
water.  ST is for each tentacle. Entire animal is ST 140-400.
Impaling attacks on tentacles are not doubled.  Grappling with all
tentacles can pull 10 times its weight at 2 yards per second.  To
attack head or vitals requires  getting into the water. Tentacles do
ST crushing damage, and pull victim towards water and mouth at 1 yd
per turn. Once in the water, victim will start drowning (see Holding
Your Breath, p B91). Tentacle can pull STx20. If not enough, then more
tentacles.

Aqaa *                    (afanc)                Worm of the Catacombs

ST: 50-90               Move/Dodge: 6/5             Size: 14-40

Very large worm 7 to 20 yards longs, covered with brown bristles. The
mouth is 2 yds wide.  Those swallowed can cut from the inside, or
those outside can cut into worm. Danger of striking victim. Tail whip
can do 3d cr damage. Those swallowed are at -3 DX because of cramped
quarters.  Digestive acid does 1d-1 damage per turn. Leather and Cloth
provide normal DR, but lose 1 DR per 5 seconds. Metal protects fully
for DR turns, and then provdes normal DR thereafter.

Biridlu *          (manta ray/rumtifusel)                       Mantle

ST: 18-24              Move/Dodge: 13/7            Size: 1-2
DX: 14                 PD/DR: 2/2                  Weight: 50-300 lbs.
IQ: 5                  Damage: 1d cr
HT: 14/18-24           Reach: C                    Habitats: Sub

Used as tomb guardians. Manta ray-like bodies, suffocate with muscular
folds of body. They fight without checking morale; they fight to the
death.  They drop on a victim and envelop them. Treat as grapple -
Quick Contest of DX. If successful, begins suffocating victim (p.
B112). Impaling attacks are not doubled, and any attack of greater
than 4 hits, goes through to possibly hurt the victim (on 9- half of
the remaining damage hits the victim). Move 3 on ground.  Regenerate 1
HT per 10 seconds unless burned. Totally invulnerable, except to
steel, magic and fire damage.

Chashkeri                                                 Water-maiden

ST: 6-8                Move/Dodge: 6/6                Size: 1
DX: 13                 PD/DR: 1/1                     Weight: 100 lbs.

HT: 6-8                Reach: C                       Habitats: SW

Looks like a beautiful dark-haired woman. It stores mana in its eyes,
allowing it to cast Charm at skill level 15. It can store up to 30
points of mana.  The spell is cast instantaneously, the Chashkeri only
has to look at the target.  It can recover 1 mana point per 10
minutes.  It takes charmed victims to underwater lair (see Swimming,
p. B91).  Ahoggya, Shen, and Tinaliya are immune. Spell ends when
chashkeri is killed. 2 days to recover from Charm, and at -2 DX and
IQ.

Chlen *                 (Elephant,triceratops)            Armour-Beast

ST: 200-300              Move/Dodge: 2/0              Size: 10-15
DX: 10                   PD/DR: 5/5                   Weight: 4-8 tons
IQ: 5                    Damage: #
HT: 15/40-50             Reach: C                     Habitats: P

Six legged, horned beast with flattened head with horns and beak.
Domesticatible, if subdued. Fights only when attacked.  Horny hide is
used for armour/weapons. Secret armorer's clan processes allow it to
be molded and then hardened. Like bronze. Skin is stripped from living
animals.  It then regrows in a few weeks. Used to pull enormous carts,
but they are very slow.  Head butt does 2d-1 imp., trample does 3d
cr., bite does 2d cr.

HT: 12-14             Reach: C,1                  Habitats: F,J,M*,Sub

Constructed by the priests of Ksarul, these anthropoids have long jaws
and sharp teeth, a crude nose, large faceted eyes. They will attack if
they outnumber the party. They can use clubs and spears and other
simple tools.  Can attack with clubs and spears, or bite for 1d cut,
or punch for 1d-1 cr. They are smart enough to cooperate, and usually
grapple and bite, unless they are carrying weapons.

Cholokh                       (octofly)       Flying Octopoid Creature

ST: 8-10                Move/Dodge: 15/7            Size: 2 ?

Six legged, greyish brown flying creatures with thick armored
carapace, large shimmering wings, powerful jaws. Eight tentacles are
used to throw rocks (1d-1 cr). Attacks from 3-20 yds with missiles. If
they hit, then they close.  Never checks morale. Move 2 on ground.
Bite does 1d+1 cut. Tentacles grapple or wield rocks (1d cr.)

Dlakolel *                  (giant beetle)      Flying Beetle Creature
                                                        Steed of Sarku

IQ: 6                      Damage: 2d-1 cut
HT: 12/25-35               Reach: C                        Habitats: J

Large, semi-intelligent flying insect. Check reaction when
encountered, friendly or neutral reactions possible. Will fight to the
death, if attacked.  Jaws and claws. Black chitinous shell. Six legged
with shiny black wings.  Move 7/7 on the ground. Bite does 2d-1
cutting.

Dlaqo *                     (giant beetle)              Carrion Beetle

IQ: 2                  Damage: 1d+2 cut
HT: 12/14-40           Reach: C                   Habitats: Sub

Six legged crawling insect with a glossy green shell, large pincer
jaws. These creatures only attack individuals or pairs, or if they can
surprise the party.  Otherwise they flee. They eat carrion, so there
is a high chance of finding them in areas of dead creatures. Bite is
very dirty; anyone bitten must roll against HT for possible infection
(p. B116). Bite does 1d+2 cut.

Dnelu                          (waira)                Concealed Leaper

ST: 18-22               Move/Dodge: 9/8               Size: 2

HT: 14/15-21            Reach: C,1                    Habitats: P, M*

These furry, six legged creatures live in underground dens covered
with sod. They jump out to grapple small parties to carry back to the
den, usually gaining Surprise or Total Surprise. They don't check
morale, but they rarely attack parties of 6 or more. They like to
collect bright objects. They have a sharp barbed tongue.

Dzor                    (cyclops,giant,atdlit)           Forest Giant

ST: 25-35                Move/Dodge: 8/6               Size: 1

HT: 16/22-40             Reach: C-2                    Habitats: F, J

10-12 ft. tall giants, three eyes, beak, nictating membranes, Night
Vision, but poor day vision (-2 DX in daylight). Fight only if
attacked, using clubs, maces (6d-1 cr), but no edged weapons. Semi-
intelligent, but untrainable and no speech. Bite 1d+1 cut. Punch 2d+2
cr.

Feshenga *               (wolverine,crocotta)      Many-Legged Serpent

ST: 13-18              Move/Dodge: 8/6            Size: 1

vulnerable to edged and blunt weapons, but when in liquid form, they
cannot be injured by them.  While in human form, they punch for 2d-1
