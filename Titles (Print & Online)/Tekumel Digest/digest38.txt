Subject:      Ahoggya makes a comeback

I read EJK5@JAGUAR's (Arakesh hiIto) comments with interest,
and he has a compelling view of the Ahoggya climbing and
swimming issue.  However, I took a rare opportunity to consult my
references, and see some points I had dimly remembered at best
when I first posted my query.
I discovered, as I thought I had read, that Ahoggya houses are on
stilts, with a ladder (Different Worlds version, volume 1, p. 53).
Obviously, Ahoggya can climb ladders.  I agree with EJK that it is
hard to imagine quite how they do climb ladders, but I guess two
arms grasp and pull, and the other side hangs limp.  A box with
rungs on all four sides might make more sense to the Ahoggya, but
such a device would prove clumsy to pull up into the house, as
described.  If they can climb human-style ladders (yet to be
confirmed, as we don't know what Ahoggya ladders look like) then
they should be able to climb mountains, cliffs, etc.

Regarding Ahoggya at sea, the sourcebook (Different Worlds again,
volume II, p. 30-31) describes their vessels as about the same length
as the smaller human merchant vessel class (the Hru), and the larger
Ahoggya vessels are nearly the size of the smallest Hrus.  They have
a single mast--hardly a vessel for the sort of tentative shore hugging
that EJK implies.  (That's more the Hlutrgu style.)  Although they are
not the mariners that the Shen are, shore hugging on Tekumel is no
disgrace, as few ships (regardless of race) brave the deeps and tempt
the creatures therein (what is the opposite of sushi?).

Since the Ahoggya live in swamps and build functional (albeit
small) vessels, it can be assumed that they do not fear the sea any
more than humans do.  In fact, when Earth was at an equivalent
technological level, most European mariners couldn't swim, and a fall
overboard would mean a likely drowning.  I would assume that
Ahoggya are medium-quality sailors (below Swamp Folk, humans,
and Shen, but above the other races) but sail nonetheless.
As for their ability to swim, if they have sufficient bouyancy to
keep their mouth or other breathing orifice above water, they could
swim with their legs while keeping all arms free for combat.
Perhaps they could wear floation bladders (like water-wings)?  The
bouyancy of Ahoggya remains to be tested (I am thinking of the
witch in "Monty Python and the Holy Grail") but their density could
be calculated from their average size and weight from the SG tables
in the Player's Handbook, if anybody cares to calculate Ahoggya
volume?

Subject:  Miniatures Rules/Question

Greetings to all!  I don't believe that I've sent a notice to this list before,
though I recognize many of the names from some of the other FRPG lists.

In any case, I thought I would bring to your attention a new set of miniatures
rules "Hordes of the Things", by Phil Barker and Wargames Research Group.  I
don't think that the two Barkers are related...

HotT is a fantasy version of the now popular ancient/medieval quick play
game De Bellis Antiquitatis, and generally only involves 'armies' represented
by 30-50 figures.  Among the lists of fictional fantasy armies included with
the game is a brief discussion of the armies of Tekumel.  For any of you
with a small number of miniatures and a desire to use them for something, I
would suggest that you consider taking a look at these rules.  I can type
a longer description later, if anyone is interested.

Now for the question: I was about ready to sell my meager supply of Tekumelyani
miniatures around Christmas, but these rules became available while the deal
was pending.  Now, rather than looking to sell, I would be interested in
acquiring more.  Does anyone have any 'official' information on recommended
in-production figures for use as Tsolyani, and does anyone know what happened
to the molds last used by Tekumel Games a few years ago to do another prod-
uction run of the original figures from Old Guard (?) and Ral Partha?
