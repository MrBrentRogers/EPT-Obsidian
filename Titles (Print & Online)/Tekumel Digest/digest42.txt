Administrivia:
After having done it once by hand, I now have an automated
index script. That, along with my other automated scripts,
makes maintaining the digest pretty easy. Now all I need 
is a good method for adding new subscribers to the mailing 
list.  If anyone has a good, flexible script for doing so, 
I'd like to know about it. Thanks.

Also, I'd like to encourage people to use more descriptive subjects
than "Tekumel Digest, #xx". It will make the index much more useful
in the long run. Thanks.

Okay, I got cooked on the Phil Barker/MAR Barker connection.  Coming from
a role-playing background rather than a miniatures background, I assumed
that the low level of Tekumel awareness among most role-players could be
generalized to miniatures as well.  As Mr. Dean pointed out, I was not
correct in my assumptions.
   Although I am unlikely to have time to play miniatures battles, I have
been fascinated with the elaborate formations of Tekumeli soldiers in
battle, and wonder how miniatures rules handle them, and I would love to
see the pagentry of a miniatures battle.  The Hordes rules seem to make
miniatures armies more possible--I personally own a handful of miniatures
(6 Tsolyani archers, 6 Mu'ugalavyani spearmen, and a small variety of priests).

I am more interested in the availability of non-human miniatures.  I have three
armored Shen, one Ahoggya, and some Ssu.  Are the miniatures being sold
anywhere currently?

ONe of my other old hobbies is Origami (Japanese paper folding) and I have
actually devised an Ahoggya model, and I have been trying to fold either a
Pe Choi or a Hluss with little success.  I had hoped that if I got good
at it, I couild manufacture my own "miniatures" for role playing purposes.
