Subject: Tekumel material reviews wanted

	Could someone post a list (and perhaps a review) of all of the
Tekumel-related gaming material available?  I'm many years behind, and I'd
like to know what's still available.

Attention PBEM Fans,
  I am volunteering to be the GM</slave of a PBEM tekumel campaign. If
anyone wishes to participate please E-Mail a description of your prefered
character. I probably can't handle more than 6 characters, if 6 turns out
to be easy then I will expand if there is interest. So get your character
in early. Typical characters are Priests, Warriors, or Sorcerors, although
other character types are possible if I feel they will work. For example,
a tomb robber was essential in _Man of Gold_ and pit-fighters are not
uncommon and make a great variation on a warrior, but no assassins please.
I will use and inititive/action based combat system thats a hybrid of
Warhammer rules. Warhammer combat is quite deadly and creativity will be
more important than dice rolls. 
No munchkins need apply.
