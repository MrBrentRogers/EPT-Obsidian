---------------------------------------
Here we go again with a new issue!  I got a ton of responses to my request
for info, so let's get on with it.
---------------------------------------
Topics for this issue: Lots of questions, lots of comments, lots of answers!

Hopefully just having the digest pass on info will help with 2.  I dont know
what to do about 1, as most people who read the digest already play.

 As you will see, I got a lot of requests for updates.  I will be making it
a regular feature.

Ok, you bring up a good point, but as I have said before, you have to
remember when the first systems came out, roleplaying was in it's infantcy
and people needed to be told how to do everything.  At Prof. Barker's games
we don't use rules.  None.  The only thing we use rule books for is the
spells.  We roll dice very seldom.  If you need to make a roll, roll the
dice  If you get a low number, say under 25, you did really well.  If you
roll over 75, you did very bad.  That's it.

I will try to get the GOddess of the pale bone, and one other stuff from
Prof. Barker.  As for spells, I would think they would be pretty standard,
with most temple spells coming from Sarku, or Durritlamish.

I would love to see it!   We need to have people write in about their
campaigns to let others know what is going on, and what can be done.

I haven't played Tactica, but I heard the same complaints about set up.
Perhaps set up could be changed somehow.  Players alternating putting a unit
on the board or something.

My dealings have been limited to a couple of phone calls.  Wes seems like a
pretty nice guy.  He is running the figure business on the side, so it may
take a while to get figures.

Eyes were originaly developed as tool, not as weapons.  In the time before
the time of darkness, eyes were more like shovels.  Eyes, like the eye of
revvivitacion dont need to be aimed, you just put it next to the body and
press.  Other eyes are mostly area effect, so being off by a little bit
doesn't really matter that much.  Being a couple feet off with a doomkill
is still pretty good.

The new RPG is now in playtesting.  The tuesday night group is using the new

Ok, there is a lot of confusion right now with all the new stuff.  The
original S&G were the brown and blue books.  The source book (blue one)
was reprinted in I think two books that got published, and a third that
didn't.  The new books from TOME are entirely new material.  In the first
you create a character.  In the others you take that character on a "do it
yourself" adventure to more round out the character.  The books make great
reading.  In fact, that is where we find out about Eselne's escape from
Dhichune's death plots.

We will try to get some character profiles.  See later in this issue for a
profile of Arjai, and his wife.

Not exactly, new stuff is coming out, with rules coming soon.

I plan on using FUDGE when I run a game.  There will never be a GURPS
Tekumel unless Steve Jackson games lightens up their contract.

>Rick Simonds

Ok, here is as good a place as any to put this in.  I have not seen the
EoASW, so I cant comment on the recent history.   But the following is what
I remember from the game.


Dhichune killed his father while on a visit to Avanthar. Mridobu was able to
escape with his life by hiding in his fathers coffin while it was being sent
down river to Bey-Su.  He is now in hiding.  The Kolumejalim was indeed
held in one day.  Dhichune claimed victory when no one showed up.  The fact
that he didnt bother to notify anyone didn't seem to matter.

Since the asscension of Dhichune, Tsolyanus has gone balistic.  Many cities
are in revolt, and a lot of armies are on the move.  Reresqalla has quelled
the food riots in Jakalla, and is forming his power base there.  Princess
Main (ma-een) has gone to Jakalla to form an alliance with Reresqalla.

Princess Arimalla is said to be cnsidering renouncing the gold, and becoming
a sculptress.

Mirusiya is holed up in Fasiltum, and even the great Karim Missum couldn't
get him to leave right now.

This newest prince, Taksuru, is gaining power, and forming an army in
bey-su., He seems the most millitant at this time.

As for the greater picture, Mu' uglavya now owns the Chakas, except for the
Do Chakas which the pei-Choi have taken.

In Yan kor, Baron ald is spending his time running from city to city putting
down revolts.

Millimanya is just sitting there doing nothing.

The areas of pijanani are more independant.

In Livyanu the plague has ended, but the shen are moving north, and the
Millumaniya are moving south.

Sa alaqi has abandoned yan kor and is trying to pull itself together.

That is about as up to date as we know it.  Also, the Suu have been sighted
in the Chaigari region.

Yes I did, but as it was in a format that I had no way to decipher, I
couldn't use it.  Sorry.

In response,  High level characters were used primarily for the reason you
stated, people don't like to worry about money.  You also have more access
to "higher" adventures.  Low level clans wouldn't be able to rent a ship to
send a group of people to tsamra, but a high level clan could.

I don't know anyone who uses Fantasy hero system.  Sorry.




Now, on a personal note, I will be getting married on Sept. 11th, so next
issue will be out a couple weeks after that.  If anyone is interested in
sending a gift, we are registered at TCF bank.  ;-)


Thanks for all your responses!
