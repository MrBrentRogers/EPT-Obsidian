Subject: EPT translation to GURPS

I have a lot more rules for GURPS Tekumel that I developed for my
PBeM campaign, but they aren't complete, so I whipped together
this translation of EPT (much easier than Swords and Glory).
I will follow later with some of the classic spells, like Doomkill
and The Hands of Kra the Mighty, in GURPS format. Enjoy.

Translation from Empire of the Petal Throne to GURPS (3rd ed.)

Experience

Since starting characters in GURPS have 100 points, a 1st
level EPT PC starts with that amount. But a "normal" person
in GURPS is 25 points, so 1st level EPT NPCs start at that
number of points. The following table shows the points given
for various EPT levels:

     EPT    GURPS PC   GURPS NPC
    Level    Points     Points
    ____________________________
      1       100           25
      2       105       30 (+5)
      3       110           35
      4       115           40
      5       120           45
      6       125           50
      7       130           55
      8       140      65 (+10)
      9       150           75
     10       160           85
              ...

Players should design their characters at 100 points and
then spend the extra points as if they received them during
play. This way any increases in the basic attributes will
cost double and they won't be able to take 150 points of
physical advantages.

Attributes

The following table shows the equivalent EPT Basic Talents
and GURPS Attributes:

    EPT Basic Talent       GURPS Attribute
    --------------------------------------
    Strength           _   ST
    Dexterity          _   DX
    Intelligence       _   IQ
    Constitution       _   HT

Since Empire of the Petal Throne uses randomly rolled Basic
Talents, the levels of GURPS ST, DX, IQ and HT given below
are guidelines, and therefore optional.  Character points
must still be spent normally.  Since there are no attributes
in GURPS for Comeliness and Psychic Ability, these EPT
attributes translate into the GURPS Appearance
advantages/disadvantages and Magery, respectively (see
tables below).

When choosing basic attributes for the converted character
keep the relative ratios approximately the same.  If the
character's Strength was higher than his Intelligence as a
EPT character it should be higher as a GURPS character as
well.  The primary idea is to capture the same feeling in
the character. The following tables work well as numbers
with which to start.  Adjust them as needed.

    61-80 Somewhat Psychic   Magery 1
    81-95 Quite Psychic      Magery 2
    96-00 Highly Psychic     Magery 3

Using the above, a 6th level Str 93, Dex 77, Int 35, Con 65,
Psy 39, Com 45 EPT warrior might be ST 15, DX 13, IQ 9, HT
12 in GURPS with no Magery and Average appearance.  This
would cost 100 character points which would require the
character to take some disadvantages to afford advantages
and skills.  Once the initial design is done, award the
extra 25 points for having been a 6th level EPT character.

Money

The various coinage in EPT and GURPS breaks down as follows:

    EPT Money => 400 copper Qirgal = 20 silver Hlash = 1 gold Kaitar.
    GURPS Money => 100 copper = $20 = 1 gold.

Convert EPT money into silver Hlash, then Hlash = GURPS $.
GURPS wealth advantages and disadvantages will need to be
taken, if starting wealth (including possessions) is above
or below $1000.  See Wealth table below:

    EPT Wealth      GURPS Wealth
    ____________________________
    0-199 SP        Dead Broke
    200-499 SP      Poor
    500-999 SP      Struggling
    1000-1999 SP    Average
    2000-4999 SP    Comfortable
    5000-19999 SP   Wealthy
    20K-99K SP      Very Wealthy
    >=100K SP       Filthy Rich

Skills

Converting skills is relatively easy.  Pick the GURPS
equivalents of the desired EPT skills and add a few more
from the GURPS list.  Some of the EPT skills are multiple
skills in GURPS (EPT assassin-spy-tracker becomes Stealth,
Tracking, Shadowing, Poison, etc.).

    Spells

    Converting spells is relatively difficult.  If you try
    to pick the GURPS equivalents of a number of EPT spells
    it may turn out that you need to know a hundred spells
    (or more!) to meet all the prerequisite requirements.
    Pick out the major spells that have close equivalents
    and take all their prerequisites.
