In response to Charles Martin's response to my old question:

His spin on the Ahoggya-Shen feud is a very thought-provoking one.
I suspect the Shen know more about the Ahoggya than he believes, but
he may have a good point about Tsolyani recruited Shen vs. others.
His point about egg groups is also well-taken.  On the other hand,
if humans were fighting an alien race that ate the bodies, I could
well imagine ignoring national and ethnic hatreds and uniting against
the common foe.  Remember, the Shen have served human meat to other
humans when they want to humiliate them, and they regularly eat infants
judged not acceptable.  To Shen, the act of eating sentient flesh may
well represent the ultimate insult of insults, and there could very well
be a race-wide aversion to the Ahoggya as a result, story apochryphal or
not.  Without recourse to a higher authority, the argument could well
go either way.  I do agree that the Ahoggya probably think the feud is
more jocular than the Shen do, especially since a one-on-one fight is
more likely to serve the Ahoggya (or the Shen to the Ahoggya) than
vice-versa.

  In regards to Fu Shi'i's masters, I didn't consider the Hokun, although
that is also possible.  I have my doubts that the Hokun would have as
much access to magic, although anything is possible.  It seems likely that
Fu Shi'i serves the Goddess of the Pale Bone is some capacity, given his
ease of use of the Cube of Flint and his lack of concern in using her
servants and powers, but there is probably some intermediary.  If the
Hokun are his masters, that might explain Mr. Alberti's lack of concern
with the riddle of Fu Shi'i.  Were he a servant of the Goddess, I suspect
he might be a bit more interested.  Or maybe he doesn't know?

  I have long been interested in Tekumel fonts for the Mac.  I tried
to construct some a long time ago (when I had time) but my software
kept crashing the system, and that was that.  I will soon be getting
a new Mac and I may approach the problem again, although the right to
left type presents a challenge, as does dealing with the "dead-keys"
for option- and shift-option combinations.  In the meanwhile, I have
Macpaint format digitized versions of the characters as found in the
index of the Gamescience edition of the Sourcebook--all four languages,
I believe.  (I don't remember if Livyani was one of the languages listed,
but if it was, I have it.)

What are Ngu'uka pits?  Is this something I should know about?
