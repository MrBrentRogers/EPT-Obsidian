Subject: Getting Tekumel materials

I thought that people who are having trouble getting Tekumel material
might like the address for Different Worlds, which has some (at least
I think they do). Of course, the best thing is to get your local
game store to order this stuff through a distributor, since that lets
both the local store and the distributor know that there is interest
in this stuff. Maybe they will stock it more regularly. My local
game store has kept EPT, and the 2 volumes of the Sourcebook in stock
for a while, along with the new version of The Book of Ebon Bindings
(I think they've sold at least 3 copies). Maybe next time i come into
some money, I should pcik these up, just to make my contribution to
the cycle.

Anyway, if that doesn't work, here is the address:

Different Worlds
2814-19th Street
San Francisco CA 94110

The last I had heard, it was called "The Lords of Tsamra" and was a direct
sequel to The Man of Gold. (Harsan goes to Livyanu with his wives.) The last
I heard, Phil was restarting on it this summer.
