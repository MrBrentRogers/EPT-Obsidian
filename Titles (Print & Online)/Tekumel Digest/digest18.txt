Subject: Ultimate Secret of Tekumel

I was rereading "Flamesong" the other day and came across
the reference in the appendix to the "ultimate secret of Tekumel,"
which explains why Tekumel dropped out of our dimension and 
which Barker said he would eventually reveal in the series of novels
he's writing. Since it looks like it's going to quite a while before
this happens, I thought it might be fun to speculate on exactly what
the secret is. 

It could have been all an accident due to the misapplication of the 
technology of the ancients. What I think is more likely, though, is 
that one or several of the gods decided to make a nice little
laboratory to either test out some of their ideas or develop magical
tools to use in their various schemes. Any other suggestions?
