TOME is definitely going to re-release the maps, but not anytime soon.  
Apparently a source for the maps exists, and they can be had for $15, but I 
have not located the address for these maps yet.  I will try to obtain this 
information for the next Digest.

The original game rules apparently had an index of Jakalla on page 95,
including the names of the tombs of Sirandar III, Bashishamsar II, and 
various Engsvanyali governors.

No, there are no plans to republish Qadardalikoi.

I mentioned that most of the players in Professor Barker's Thursday night
game are Vimuhla worshippers -- that's not to say that MOST PLAYERS are
Vimuhla worshippers, that's just the balance in OUR group.

>and Vimuhla is heavily associated with the Ssu, who together
>overthrew Pechano, leading to most of my world's problems.

AUGH!  What a concept.  I hope your branch of reality is one I 
never explore.  ;-)

According to Barker, no, as Ksarul is fated to someday be set free.

>at the very least would intervene.  I ask because some potential

There are two kinds of bond holding Ksarul in his room:  Wards and Keys.
Each Key has two or three Wards which prevent it from being used or, once
used, from being un-used.  Wards are easier to find than Keys, and are not
necessarily located physically "near" the Keys they serve.

The task of finding and using a Key to further Ksarul's release would be a
Very Long Adventure -- an entire campaign could be directed towards it,
occupying the entire lifetime of a player's character, and taking several
years of our time.

A few keys have already been found and used, and rest upon a table in
a place of waiting beside Ksarul's tomb (I've been there and touched the
door, oooh, aaah).  However, not all keys are what you would call "hidden".
One key which is very well known is the Key in the possession of the Mad
King of Salarvya.  Deep beneath the palace in Tsatsayagga, the figure of
a gently smiling young man reposes upon an altar.  Those who meet high
favor with the Mad King are permitted to make sacrifices to this figure,
which is one of the Keys.  If one sacrifices objects of blue, such as
blue gems, blue fabric, even blue flowers, the figure grants boons and
riches.

>stealing a Key from
>Bassa, King of the Black Ssu, would take the power of, say, Subadim
>the Sorcerer.)  In any event, I strongly suspect completion of the
>quest would mean the end of that version of Tekumel.

Not in the least.  There are three possible endings for Tekumel.
The first are those planes where the Egg of the World has been reconstructed
and Tekumel returned to its original plane.  The second are those planes
which become so unlikely that they can no longer sustain themselves and
fade or dissolve away (sometimes known as "bubble" planes).  The third
are those planes which lead to the End of Time, where the sun sets eternally
over Avanthar.

In this latter place is the College at the End of Time.  Here, all the
greatest mages and sorcerors of the many planes and races gather to hold
off the end of time and secure the well-being of the Tekumel multiverse.
Time works strangely here, and cause-and-effect laws have no meaning.
While personal subjective time seems to progress normally, it's entirely
possible to have a conversation with someone you haven't met yet, to
be given back something one hasn't yet loaned out, and to meet the same
person twice within a few moments.

However, one does not ever meet oneself at the College, no matter how hard
one tries.  On VERY rare occasions people have accidentally met themselves
(usually shortly after a magical arrival), and nothing particularly untoward
has occurred.

Ksarul is fated to be freed, and the time of his freedom is not clear.
But there is not necessarily a connection between the freeing of Ksarul
and the end of Tekumel.  The Egg of Time exerts a more direct influence
upon the Tekumel multiverse.

Festive Greetings to All.

     I am writing to inform the Digest of some recent Tekumel related
publications over here in the UK which I feel will be of interest to everyone.

     The first and more minor event was the publication of a 4 page review of
"The Empire of The Petal Throne" in "The Last Province" which is the new
"independent British roleplaying"  magazine over here. The article is a factual
but I would suggest not very atmospheric review of EPT and subsequent Tekumeli
publications. This was under the column "Revenants" which reviews classic games
(the last issue looked at Bushido).  The article also comments that "a Tekumel
e-mail magazine was being run on the Internet System but is currently
inoperative" and then suggests that interested parties should contact Brett
Slocum, whose home address is given, for archive material. I will write to the
magazine to give the correct current information on E-mail addresses for the
Digest.

     The second and more important item was announced at the end of the first.
This is the publication of a new Tekumel fanzine "The Eye Of All-Seeing Wonder"
by

Dave Morris
1, Rusham Road
Wandsworth
London
SW12 8TJ
UK

Available for 2.50 pounds in the UK (3.00 pounds from outside the UK)
I don't know how Dave would want this paid so it might be better sending 
a letter asking from abroad. It can cost 8.50 pounds to have a $10.00 check 
changed!!

     I have a copy of the first issue of the "Eye" and it is dedicated "with
respect and gratitude to Professor M.A.R. Barker, creator of Tekumel". The
contents are

An Introductory GURPS Scenario: "Welcome to Jakalla"

The Epic of Hrugga: The deeds of the favourite Tsolyani folk-hero

The Relative Status of the Legions

The Profession of Arms: social status and promotion

The Clan of The Iron Plume: life and loves of a scribe

Joyful Sitting Amongst Friends: letters col, Set up by provocative questions in
this issue

Tusmikang Khawenlitusmi!: Schools of combat style for GURPS

Best Savoured Cold: The enemies of mankind in RQ stats

The Excellent Travelling Volume: Travellers tales from (this time) Jannu
(where?)

Plus a centre pull out section

TIRIKELU: Part One of a complete role-playing game for games on Tekumel

Total number of pages 36. 24 of mag + 12 of rules for new (and excellent
looking) game.


     The aim of the fanzine is to promote Tekumel based games of any kind so
articles based on any game system can be submitted. All contributions are of a
high standard and seem to be written by people who have put a lot of thought
into getting the Tekumel atmosphere right.

I can highly recommend it and no I'm not involved or an author ... Yet.

Paul Snow
