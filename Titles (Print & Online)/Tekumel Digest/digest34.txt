Okay, I'll bite.
1. George, how does your game resemble Tekumel if you've been playing for
eight years before you heard of it?  Or is it just EPT you didn't know
about, but you knew of Tekumel?  Do you intend to try to merge in?

2. Heather, I may be able to get the Different Worlds editions of EPT
if you are interested.  The Compleat Strategist in New York City sometimes
has copies; in fact, you could call them directly (call information for
their phone number; the E. 33rd st branch is their headquarters) because
they do mail order.

3. DML, I wasn't aware the emperor had been assassinated.  Which one?
Hirkane?  I was under the impression he died a natural death.  If he
was assassinated, it is quite possible that that He'essa, "Those who
are seen yet not seen" had something to do with it, as they are
indetectable by sorcerous means.  Even the Omnipotent Azure Legion may
have become complaicent about their abilities.  I guess I should check
my back digests for the news on Hirkane's death.

Yes, Bob, read Digest #3 about recent events. These tales are from Barker's
own campaign, via Bob Alberti. If as Bob says, the OAL is full of brown robes,
then it could have been an inside job. But I think that the brown robes in the OAL
were put there by Dhich'une after he ascended the throne.
