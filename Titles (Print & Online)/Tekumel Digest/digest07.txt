It has come to my attention (Thanks, Bob) that there is a
typo in the header file for this digest. The directory that
the archives reside in is '/pub/rpg/tekumel', not 
'/pub/rgp/tekumel'. I hope that this hasn't inconvienced anyone.

Subject: TOME and Barker to re-issue EPT

3 July 1991
Minneapolis

Recently, Theatre of the Mind/Clash of Arms games of Pennsylvania entered
negotiations towards publishing an all-new edition of the Empire of the
Petal Throne (EPT) role-playing game written by M. A. R. Barker.

Theatre of the Mind has re-issued the popular _Book of Ebon Bindings_
and has announced plans to re-issue the _Deeds of the Ever-Glorious_,
an updated compendium of the military legions of Tsolyanu.  Plans are
also underway to release new works, including an EPT World Book, Solitare
Adventure, and World Maps.  It is hoped to coordinate the release of these
new materials with the publication of Professor Barker's third EPT novel
sometime in 1992.

Difficulties encountered in publishing the _Book of Ebon Bindings_ included
the refusal of several large distributors to accept the publication based on
the controversial nature of the work, and the refusal of _The Dragon_,
published by TSR, to print the advertisement for the _Book_.

The _Book of Ebon Bindings_ is currently carried by four distributors, and
if it is unavailable in your area, ask your local game store to contact one
of the following distributors:  Chessex, Aladdin (of Burnsville, Minnesota),
Berkeley, and Zocci.

If you have questions or comments to address to the publishers, you may write
to:

TOME, Inc.
PO Box 60668
King of Prussia, Penn  19406

Additionally, Theatre of the Mind will be present at Gen-Con with copies of
the _Book of Ebon Bindings_.  They will be located in booth #423.

Thanks for the errata. Will update soon. Thanks also for the
update on new products. Theatre of the Mind at least looks like it
is really serious about producing products. I noticed on the
Ebon book that Different Worlds was still mentioned in the copyright
page. Does that mean that they still hold the rights but are licensing
them to Theatre of the Mind, or some such arrangement. 

I saw that disclaimer and actually thought that it was appropriate for the 
material. It is, after all, pretty icky stuff, and a disclaimer doesn't hurt 
much.  I think that The Dragon's refusal to advertise it is unfortunate and
stupid and paranoid, but not unexpected from them. My word, Tekumel material
that is trying to advertise? What is the world coming to? :-) Did Zocchi
ever advertise S&G? I don't remember ever seeing an ad, but then I wasnt reading
any game magazines at the time.

Well, that's all for now.

Theatre of the Mind bought the rights following its production of BEB.
That's probably why the licensing is on there.  I am not entirely clear on
Zocci's involvement and distributorship -- it was mentioned in an aside by
the fellow from TOTM that I spoke with.  Your sentiments on The Dragon echo
mine, however.

Thanks for the note!
