Subject: Creature conversions

Following is a list of creatures that I have converted from the "old" EPT
style to the "new" S&G format.  Its not perfect, in many cases I had to 
guesstimate how to rate the critter's combat/magic and/or armor rating,
but I think its definately a step up from "I'll just make it up as I go 
along" format.

MR=magic resistance level
combat #-# = the level of warrior skill the creature has in that weapon
Table (letter) = the damage table to use if the creature hits, if followe
                 by a +# add the number to the final damage NOT to the
                 d20 roll.
Armor = the ammount subtracted from weapon hits, a negative value ADDS
        to the damage sustained
Monsters marked with an * are undead types

These are my own conversions and seem to work well, many of the monsters
may seem really nasty, and they are.  Players should not expect to stand
up to a Ru'un and walk away unscathed unless they have some items that
can affect it or a sorcerer of Ksarul with the proper level of the spell
"The Web of Refulgent Command"!  Tekumel monsters are tough and PCs should
learn to head for the horizon when something really nasty presents itself
if they don't have a way to deal with it.
I've left out the Ssu, Shunned Ones, Hluss and Hlutrgu because their stats
are in the S&G book.
I hope people can get some use out of this and that it solves more 
problems than it creates.
