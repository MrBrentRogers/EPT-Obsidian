Subject: Campaign

The campaign I started in was a bit different.
The system was Rolemaster with modifications like an added Height Build
statistic, and the GM had gotten us a bit used to Tekumel with the last
campaign which included the EPT Gods, some monsters and the class system.

Our characters were 1st level, and well we ran. We were on a ship, and we saw
an embracer of ships or two, but luckily weren't very near. We saw a Hluss
hive ship. After our ship was atomized by this unlucky encounter, those few
of us in the lifeboat (we had departed quite a bit earlier) managed to make
isle's beach.  Unfortunately the bottom of the boat was torn out by the reefs
surrounding the beach itself.
      So there we were, a wizard of K'sarul who didn't have any knowledge
yet of demons or anything else in his specialty. A priest of Vimuchla who was
able to boil water for us. A warrior of Vimuchla and one of... hmm I don't
quite remember.  We also shared the company of the bowsin and another member
of the crew of the original (now Hluss destroyed ship). The bowsin got
severly injured procuring us food, however we tended his wounds as best we
could. We explored our home as best we could. Over the sandbank lay a salt
swamp that extended untold miles back. To one side, the beach merely ended,
and to the other it was cut off by a channel between the ocean and the swamp.
Yet we had to make a crossing. So fixing our dinghy, that is getting it ready
for its last run in patchwork manner, we prepared to cross the channel.
      The dinghy was almost a total loss, but through luck and some GM
bribes we didn't quite sink. So now we were on the other side, but where was
that? Exploring a bit more, we saw a shape in the sand... we approached. We
stopped. It was a Hluss. It was lying face (yes I guess they could be called
faces) down and when we approached slowly we noticed that a white powder
seemed to line its joints. We pondered. We looked up. We paled. Why? Because
far in the distance we were able to see a glow. A glow that seemed oddly
familiar. The glow of a Hluss ship.

More to come.

Subject: Combining GURPS and the S&G magic system

A friend of mine developed this system for using the S&G magic
system with GURPS characters. I don't necessarily agree with 
some specifics of his system, but the general idea is good.
This way you can use all the same, wonderful spells from S&G
Player's Book, and not have to try to translate each spell to
GURPS (a slow task I assure you from experience).

     Using the S&G magic system with GURPS
              by John Finsrud

In the Skill Levels and Purchasable Skills table, replace
the S&G skill level with 5 spell points per level (e.g.
skill level 2 is equal to 6-10 spell points, skill level
16+ is equal to 76+ spell points).

On the Spell Casting Cost table, use the same conversion for skill level
to spell points. Divide all fatigue costs in the table by 5.
Example: a G5 ritual spell costs a skill level 8 mage 55 power points.
This translates to a cost of 11 fatigue for a mage with 41-45 spell
points.

He calculates Psychic Power Points = IQ + HT + Psychic Ability.
Psychic Ability is a new attribute, starting at 10, and bought
normally.

To learn spells, the following table is used:

       Spell Difficulty Table

Spell
Level     Universal   Generic   Temple
  1           ME         ME       ME
  2           ME         ME       MA
  3           ME         MA       MA
  4           MA         MA       MA
  5           MA         MA       MA
  6           MA         MA       MH
  7           MH         MH       MH
  8           MH         MH       MH
  9           MH         MH       MH
 10           MH        MVH      MVH
  

Nice little conversion.

I'd just use Magery and not the Psychic Ability attribute.
Then add Magery * 5 points to Power Points. I would also
slightly change the Difficulty table. I'd say all Level
10 and T9 spells are MVH, and T1 spells are MA. Something 
like this: 

       Spell Difficulty Table

Spell
Level     Universal   Generic   Temple
  1           ME         ME       MA
  2           ME         ME       MA
  3           ME         MA       MA
  4           MA         MA       MA
  5           MA         MA       MH
  6           MA         MH       MH
  7           MH         MH       MH
  8           MH         MH      MVH
  9           MH        MVH      MVH
 10          MVH        MVH      MVH

If you try this out, let me know how it works, and give me any
suggestions you might have.   -- Brett
