Subject: novels, game systems 

Hello all,

First, thanks to everyone who replied to my question about the Tekumel
novels. I've discovered they're both out of print. I would greatly 
appreciate any help in aquiring these books by mail, or if any one 
knows of a store somewhere near New Hampshire that might still have
copies. Perhaps they'll be reprinted when the newest novel is 
published?

I recently bought a pile of Tekumel items from Different Worlds. My 
request for a catalog took a while, but my order was shipped promptly.
The address was in the digest a few issues ago.

As long as I'm talking about obtaining the unobtainable, has anyone got 
a line on how to get the Swords & Glory player's handbook? Failing that,
how about more of Brett's GURPS rules? The main reason I dropped out of
Tekumel back in the 70's was that clunky and now absurdly antique game 
system.

I can scout the local used bookstores. I seem to recall seeing Man of Gold
recently.  I will let you know if I see it next time I'm there, and
we can arrange to mail it.  I also hope they get reprinted.

Oh, good. I had hoped they were still in business. I'm glad things
worked out for you.

I have never seen the player's book in any of the used game sections
around town. I have seen the Different Worlds books, namely parts 1 & 2
of the sourcebook and the reprint of the original EPT rules. But,
even if you find other rules, such as mine, keep trying to get that
player's book. I continue to find it to be one of the most useful 
resources for my GURPS system. The magic system alone is worth the
price of admission.

One of the beauties of Tekumel is that it really doesn't matter what system
you use. I've played with Chivalry and Sorcery rules, homebrew rules,
even Traveller rules. So, in the interim, play with your favorite fantasy
rules.

I'm in the process of cleaning up my GURPS rules. I'll post them with
appropriate fanfare RSN (meaning not until after I move to my new house
at the end of September). These will be in pieces, probably the character
rules first, then the magic. I could do the races pretty soon.

Subject: GURPS character rules

Well, after thinking about it, I decided to send what I've got to
give y'all a start.  After all, this digest has been kind of dead
lately. Periodically, I'll send more stuff, including non-human
races. (BTW, the format is from SJGames' format for submissions.
Don't let it phase you. AA, BB, CC, DD are headings of decreasing
importance. Just about anything in angle brackets (<>) is a command
to the desktop publishing system. <BI> is to change to bold-italic,
<M> returns to Roman, etc. You can ignore just about everything like
that.)

These rules are incomplete, but should give you a good start in
creating GURPS characters for Tekumel.  More refinements will
be available as I write them.  If you have comments, corrections or questions,
please feel free to let me know.  These rules have been playtested
somewhat in my Tekumel PBeM campaign, which has since passed on to a new
GM. If you use these rules, the Sourcebook should be used as the final 
arbiter of what is reasonable for Tekumel.

Enjoy them.

AA Tekumel Characters
(Copyright 1991 by Brett Slocum. All rights reserved.)

Create characters for Tekumel using the <BI>Basic Set<M> and <BI>GURPS 
Magic<M>. 100-point characters are suggested for the average campaign with a 
general limit of 40 points of disadvantages and 5 quirks.
Tekumel can be a very dangerous place, so some GMs may desire a Cinematic 
campaign with 150 or even 200 point characters. 

CC Height and Weight Tables
Since there are many races on Tekumel, some of which do not easily fit into the 
human height and weight tables, two additional height and weight tables are 
provided below: Hlaka and Pe Choi. Also, treat humans as pre-19th century 
humans, and subtract 3" from average height. Weight is always determined 
<MI>after<M> height. Some races base their height and weight from the human 
table. Below is a table that summarizes the height and weight modifiers for all these 
races.

DD Racial Modifiers for Human Height and Weight Tables (B15)

each 2 inches of height over 6'10'', add 20 lbs. to average weight.

CC Advantages

DD Magic Aptitude       see p. B21

Magic requires Magical Aptitude and an IQ of at least 10. Those with IQ 6+ can 
use magico-technological devices, such as Eyes, but cannot cast spells.

DD Military Rank        5 points/level
The Five Empires keep highly organized standing armies, so legion members 
need Military Rank
Rank  Title
0     Changadesha (Soldier)
1     Tirrikamu (Sergeant)
2     Hereksa (Subaltern)
3     Kasi (Captain)
4     Molkar (Major)
5     Dritlan (Colonel)
6     Kerdu (General)
7     Kerdudali (Senior General)

DD Social Status

Social Status = Clan Status + Lineage Status

Clan Status (5 points / level)

Level
-1    Very Low Clan
0     Low Clan
1     Medium Clan
2     High Clan
3     Very High Clan

CC New Advantages
[intro text]

DD Mana Damper                varies

The person with this advantage affects their own use of magic, as well those 
nearby. The base level of this advantage effectively lowers the mana level in hex 
they occupy by one level and costs 10 points. Limitation: Touch Only - 1/2 cost. 
Enhancements: Extended Range - cost x radius (maximum 3 hex radius); Additional 
Mana Reduction - cost x number of Mana levels reduced. Example: a Mana 
Suppressor who reduces the Mana Level by 2 levels (Normal Mana to No Mana) at 
a radius of 2 hexes would cost 40 points (10 points x 2 hexes x 2 levels). Magic 
that originates outside of this range acts normally on those within the dampening 
effect.

DD Religious Rank             5 points/level
The character is a priest or priestess in the hierarchy of one of the temples, or a 
shaman of one of the various primitive tribes. The priesthood has a number of 
advantages that the laity lack, including +1 reaction for Reputation among their co-
religionists and others who respect their faith. He or she will be addressed by a title 
-- [examples go here] -- and can perform certain rituals and ceremonies as 
[examples go here]. Also, priests are at an advantage when calling on their deity for 
divine intervention.

CC Disadvantages
[intro]

DD Intolerance
Intolerance is rampant in the societies of Tekumel.
Religious, social, racial, national, class intolerance are possible.

DD Primitive
This disadvantage is appropriate for tribal regions, such as Tsolei, M'morcha 
and Nmartusha, Nmarchta, Nyemesel Isles, etc.

CC New Disadvantages

DD Anti-Charisma              -5 per -1 
Acts in much the same way as Charisma, except with the opposite effect. Anti-
charisma is kind of like an odious personal habit without any particular reason for 
people not liking you. Something about the character's very essence repeals people. 
People with this disadvantage tend to be social outcasts, hermits, etc. This effect 
crosses racial and species boundaries.

BB Skills
Most skills appropriate to TL3 may be chosen, though there are some 
exceptions, which will be noted in the skills section.
DD Disallowed TL3 Skills
Heraldry
Hypnosis
Lasso

Since there are no riding animals equivalent to horses, both Lance and Riding 
skills cannot be learned.

DD Survival (Arctic)
Only characters from the very far north, such as Lorun, can take this skill.

DD Beam Weapons
Some beam weapons are available as ancient artifacts on Tekumel, but due to 
limited numbers of charges and limited opportunities to practice, Beam Weapons 
can only be taken at default.

BB Economics, Jobs and Wealth
Standard starting wealth for a Tekumeli character is $1,000.  This includes all 
possessions, not just cash. Any character who is not a true wanderer (bandit, 
outcast, professional duellist, etc.) should spend no more than 20% of his wealth 
on movable goods(weapons, armor, clothing, etc.). The rest should be tied up in 
houses, rentals, investments, etc. Yearly cost of living varies with Status, and also 
according to the number of dependents and employees a character has. An NPC 
Patron, such as a noble lord or a temple, counts as an employer, and will look after 
the character's living, as well as giving gifts from time to time for outstanding 
service. The same applies to a PC who has employees; if they become dissatisfied 
with his leadership, they may seek another patron.

CC Money
1 gold Kaitar = 20 silver Hlash     dime-sized  150 / lb.
