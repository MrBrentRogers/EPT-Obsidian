In a message from parham@masig5.ocean.fsu.edu (Fred Parham) "Tekumel Magic":

This is more related to the difference between "civilized" magic and
"tribal" magic.  Both sorcerers and shaman cast psychic and ritual spells.
Sorcerers learn spells from the temples or lay-priests. Shamans learn their
spells from their master shaman. Some of the spells overlap, and like the
Temple spells (that only a particular temple will teach), shaman have
spells that only they can teach.  A shaman could go to one of the Five Empires
and learn spells in a temple, as long as they properly approached the
temple and joined it.  The method of spellcasting is the same.

> 2) What sorts of spells are restricted to particular temples? Which
> ones are generally known?

Those spells related to the inner most doctrines of the temples are "temple-only"
spells. The Grey Hand (from EPT) is actually known only to the temple of
Wuru. They won't even teach followers of Hru'u. There are a few Temple spells
that all temples know a different version of: Demonology, Revivification,
Inscription (Scroll usable only by fellow sect members), and Muniments of
Excellence (an impervious shell, no magic in or out, no physical blows in or
out).  The temple spells for Avanthe deal with air, weather, poison, fertility,
earthquakes, water, and plants. They also teach the most powerful form of
the Hands of Kra. Belkhanu's temple spells deal with removing and replacing 
souls, Astral Projection, communication with the dead, permanently putting
undead beings to rest, and preventing someone from being made into an undead.
They also teach the strongest forms of the Silver Halo of Soul Stealing, flight,
and creating nexus points. Dlamelish: ecstasy, summon succubus, disguise,
seduction, magical protection, endurance (and the opposite), sexual potence 
(and impotence), youth and aging. Hnalla: light blast, vision, a magical
barrier, destroying illusions, sleep, dispel Change demons, and creating sacred
ground. They also teach the most powerful Teleportation spell. Hru'u: dispel
Stability demons, confusion, freezing, incorporeal body, nightmares, creating
sacred (to Change) ground, stone to mud. And they teacht the most powerful
form of illusion. Karakan: morale (and demoralization), waepon mastery, 
duplication of a warrior, tremors, a death bolt. Ksarul: a horrible plague,
a magical fatigue battery, the knowledge of ancient devices, creating the
Food of the Ssu, a magical barrier, duplication of a mage, and the highest
forms of Domination for androids, illusions, and the creations of this temple:
biridlu, hli'ir, huru'u, kayi, nshe, qol, thunru'u, tsu'uru, and Ru'un.
Sarku: magical protection, steel to copper, the strongest Domination, enfeeblement,
the highest forms of reanimating undead, undead summoning. Thumis: highest
form of neutralizing poison and disease, friendliness, the highest form of
detect magic, another magical barrier, healing, preservation of books and scrolls,
instant skill learning. Vimuhla: sealing openings, a lightning bolt, a wall
of lava, reduce strength, berserker, magical blades, a barrier of flame, 
armored skin. 

You get the idea. One of my favorites from the Temple of Dra is Risibility.
It causes the target to percieve the ridiculousness of life and begins
laughing uncontrollably, at the most powerful levels, until they literally
die laughing.

The kinds of things everyone knows are simple forms of just about everything:
healing, telepathy, domination, disenchantment, invisibility, detect magic,
illusions, sleep, spell shields, terror, telekinesis, teleportation, and
animal control.

Then inbetween are the "Generic" spells that are known by a small set of
temples. This is where such venerable favorites such as Doomkill (Hnalla,
Karakan and Vimuhla only), Hands of Kra (Avanthe, Belkhanu, Dlamelish, Sarku),
Silver Halo of Soul Stealing (Belkhanu and Hru'u), Vallation (Walls, all
temples), and Vapour of Death (Hru'u, Ksarul, Sarku, and Vimuhla only) fall.
(n.b. the Cohorts of the above listed Gods can also know these spells).

> 3) Is there any particular pattern to the division of spells into psychic
> and ritual?

In general, spells associated with "psychic" types of tasks, such as telepathy,
clairvoyance, domination, psychometry, dowsing, aura reading, telekinesis,
fear, language comprehension, Hands of Kra, etc. are psychic spells (surprise,
surprise). Just about everything else is ritual.
