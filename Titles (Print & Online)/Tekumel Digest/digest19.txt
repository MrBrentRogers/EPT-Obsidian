     My long-standing theory is that the Mihalli or a faction thereof relegated
Tekumel and the other Lost Worlds into pocket dimensions for reasons of their
own.
     Part of this mystery includes the following questions:

     What is the Egg of the World?

     What is the role of deities in Tekumel?  What is the role of the Pariah
     deities and their relationship to the Pavar Pantheon?

     What are the pylons?

     Who are the Silver Suits and why do they battle so hard to get in through
     the pylons?

     Tekumel is constructed of an Infinite Multiverse:  for any decision that
     can be made within Tekumel there is a seperate branch of reality
     embodying the results of that decision.  However, some branches of 
     reality shrink and dissipate away (space and time contract in the center
     and thin at the edges:  everything on the outside ages fast and turns to
     dust, everthing in the center slows to a stop -- until the outside edges
     encroach and time accelerates just long enough for the occupants of the
     center to spend their remaining lives standing on a little one-Tsan patch
     of ground watching the Nothing roll in) while others (the "main line")
     continue on to the End of Time.  The difference between those that
     survive and those that dissipate is whether or not Avanthar exists or
     is destroyed in that universe.  Universes in which Avanthar is destroyed
     invariably wither away.  Those which preserve Avanthar eventually
     conjoin at the College at the End of Time.  This is why even though
     the Egg of the World was once reconstructed and Tekumel returned to the
     "Real world", Tekumel persists in its pocket dimension:  the fact that
     the College at the End of Time exists is proof that there will always be
     a Tekumel branch which does not return to the original universe.
     These facts lead to these questions:

     Why is the existence of Avanthar crucial to the continued existence
     of Tekumel?

     What is the significance of the College at the End of Time?

     What role do the Undying Wizards play in the universe?

     Other questions are:

     What is the status of the Mihalli, and is it true that they can travel
     from Tekumel's universe to our own?

     Who are Gidj and Sons?  How and why do they trade across time?

     What is the secret of Dlash?

     Of course, there are other Ultimate Secrets.  For instance, the Ultimate
Secret of Jakalla is that there is a hobbit and a dragon (which is thought by
the zookeepers to be some variant of Sro.  They don't know what to make of the
hobbit, who in any case is pining away.) in the Jakallan zoo.  But I didn't
tell you that ;-) .

You bring up a lot of mysterious terms. Perhaps you could expand upon them.
Egg of the World (I've heard of this, but I doubt anybody else has)
the pylons
the Silver Suits

the Egg of the World was once reconstructed and Tekumel returned to the
     "Real world". When did this happen?
     
The College at the End of Time.
Gidj and Sons?
Dlash?

I have never heard of your description of the multiple Tekumels before.

Your message brings up numerous questions that you don't even ponder. 
I'm sure everyone would be happy if you'd expand on your message.
