Subject: TOME and M.A.R.Barker release Adventures in Tekumel, Volume 1

Theatre of the Mind Games (TOME) has released volume 1 of the new
Tekumel sourcebook set, "Adventures in Tekumel".  Under a white cover with
gold lettering, and illustrated by Kathy Marschall, this sourcebook takes the
adventurer through the process of developing a character for play in the
Empire of the Petal Throne RPG.

The book contains copyable character reference sheets in its center (which
can be removed by opening and reclosing the staples), and narrative portions
giving new players insight into the workings of Tekumel.

Included in the narrative portions of the sourcebook is information regarding
the death of the previous emperor and the elevation to the Petal Throne of
the Worm Prince, Dhichune, now the emperor Eternal Splendour.

Characters developed with this sourcebook will be used with the following
two booklets of solo "practice" adventures in Tekumel.  These adventures
can be used to develop a new charater to any age or level of experience,
while familiarizing new players with the intricacies of Tekumel politics
and behaviors.  These sourcebooks are complete save for illustration and
final layout and should be released shortly.

Future releases planned include the Tekumel Bestiary (complete, save for final
editing, with at least three dozen illustrations by Giovanna) and the new
Tekumel gamebooks (in progress).

Theatre of the Mind has also re-issued the popular _Book of Ebon Bindings_
and has announced plans to re-issue the _Deeds of the Ever-Glorious_,
an updated compendium of the military legions of Tsolyanu.

The _Book of Ebon Bindings_ is currently carried by four distributors, and
if it is unavailable in your area, ask your local game store to contact one
of the following distributors:  Chessex, Aladdin (of Burnsville, Minnesota),
Berkeley, and Zocci.

If you have questions or comments to address to the publishers, you may write
to:

TOME, Inc.
PO Box 60668
King of Prussia, Penn  19406

Finally, M.A.R. Barker's third novel, tenatively titled "The Lords of Tsamra"
is still in progress, work on it having been slowed somewhat by work on the
gamebooks.
