Subject: village clan structure

According to the sourcebook, trades are pretty much under the control of
specific clans; for example, it is difficult to set yourself up as an
enterprising new Chlen-hauling entrepreneur (or even to gain experience in
the requisite skills): either you're a member of one of the carter clans or
you're not.

What does this imply for small villages, which have been characterized as
being composed of only one or two clans?  (I forget where---maybe an old
Seal of the Imperium from The Dragon?)  Perhaps the clan restrictions are
really only operative in larger cities, and village clans evolve their own
competences in essential areas (i.e., smithing).

This question is for clarification of the relationship between clans and
occupations on "real" Tekumel.  Any insights?  Thanks.

Maybe I'm going over something that has been gone over before but I've tried
to spend a couple months with my mouth shut so...
On the Ahogga (sp?) swimming issue I was thinking about the butterfly stroke
for Humans.  We swim face down and time our breathing in to match when our
head is pulled out of water.  Perhaps the Ahogga could do something similar.
I could even see them doing some kind of spinning form of swimming to bring
each face into the air while they swam on their side.

Subject: Ahoggya engineering.

Hmmm, ok, they have houses on stilts (nobody likes being flooded out I guess).
A box like ladder would be clumsy, agreed.. But how about 2 ladders set parallel? Then
both sets of arms/legs could grasp and climb.
I still think Ahoggya don't go out of sight of land, reguardless of how big 
the ship is.
The Chinese/Japanese had fairly large ships, but they never really went far
from shore and Dutch cargo ships were shallow draft vessels to make it 
into rivers where the Spanish trader ships would bottom out.
I still can't see Ahoggya climbing about in sail rigging wearing eyepatches and
swinging cutlasses, yelling 'Avast there, ya miserable Shen, heave to and 
prepare to be boarded!', but I suppose there could be raiding ships.
I agree that they could climb, but not too well. They just look to me like they
would tip over if put on too steep a grade, and they don't look like they can
deal too well with the usual rope and piton method. Maybe they could use some
kind of basket arrangement or be hauled up by comrads?
As for density I still say they'd sink like rocks.. with that carapace and all.
Besides, Ahoggya are one of the strongest of races (meaning more muscle mass)
and muscle weighs more, combined with carapace (bone?) that is rather thick
and heavy, they would get an express ride right to sea bed.
Ahoggya with flotation bladders is an amusing thought.. I can see an 
amphibious assault of hordes of Ahoggya wearing Mae Wests (with BIG trench
helmets).  Besides Ahoggya aren't well know for finesse or co-ordination, they
use the 'I'll bash it into submission' method on just about everything.
Oh, the opposite of sushi is fish food...
