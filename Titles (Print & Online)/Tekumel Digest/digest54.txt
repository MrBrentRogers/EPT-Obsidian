Administrivia:

-------------------------------------

WOW!  What is it?  Could it be a Tekumel Digest?!?

Your Administrator apologizes for his pathetic performance in his position.
Three months between digests is really pathetic, and I can only beg your
forgiveness and thank you for your patience.

Fortunately, I've gotten my friend Keith Dalluhn to try his hand at the
administration of this list, so hopefully he will do a better job than
I have, maybe even a weekly or bi-weekly mailing.  I'll remain as the 
Administrator, but Keith will be the Editor.  Thanks, Keith!

And now, on with the Digest.  It will be rather sizeable.  Please accept my 
apologies in advance if you mailed in a submission and it does not appear 
here.  No slight is intended; my mail server suffered a crash at one point.

From: Charles Martin // martin@cs.uchicago.edu

Bob, thanks for sending me the info on the Tekumel archives.  I accidently
purged all the digests from my disk and needed to recover them!  Having
just read through them again, I'd like to make a couple of comments...

Upon re-reading, I have to say that digests 50, 51, and 53 (was there a
52?) were absolutely compelling in their content.  I am ecstatic that you
are willing to serve as administrator.  It's great to have someone so close
to Professor Barker take an active interest in maintaining the digest.  I
really look forward to hearing about the events, customs, and the like on
real Tekumel and "real" gamed Tekumel.  I hope you will continue in this
capacity!

I also think you have done Tekumel proud by setting up the "gopher"
directory.  What a great idea for getting people interested!  I hope the
digest has received some new mailing-list requests from the larger Internet
community as a result.

As I was re-reading the digests, I was struck by what appears to be a
fundamental change in their character.  Under Brett, the digests were
simply a collection of postings; now they are edited, and it appears that
postings are often reduced to a Tekumel question that is subsequently
answered by you or Professor Barker.

I feel that something has been lost with this new format.  Specifically, I
don't feel that I am in contact with a community of people interested in
Tekumel anymore.  Instead, I feel that the community is there but I can't
really hear what any member of it is saying.

I picked up EPT in 1975, a year after discovering D&D.  Since that day, I
have never run a non-EPT/non-Tekumel game.  But to this day I have never,
outside of conventions or one specific trip to Minneapolis, personally met
anyone else who was familiar with Tekumel.  That's seventeen years of
living on Tekumel by myself and of trying to convey the wonder and beauty
of this alien world to my friends through the medium of FRP.  With the
advent of the Internet Tekumel Digest, that isolation was broken.

When postings to the digests are edited for inclusion, the digest begins to
feel like another Imperial Courier, or Tekumel Journal, or what-have-you. 
Not that I wouldn't want another Courier or Journal, but the personal
aspect is lost.  And once again, I'm on Tekumel alone, waiting for news
from Bey Sy.

I also suspect people may hesitate to send in non-questions, as the digest
begins to resemble a more "official Tekumel" publication.  I enjoy postings
such as "GURPS for Tekumel," or comments on the novels, or someone's
personal interpretation of whether Ahoggya can climb, swim, fly, or build
bridges.  The more official the digest becomes, the more "I think Ahoggya
can't climb because..." will become "Hey, Bob, can you ask Professor Barker
whether Ahoggya can climb?"  I think that's a terrible loss; I've just
missed seeing someone's creative imagination at work.

Professor Barker once said something like, "what you have bought is my
Tekumel; now you have to make it your Tekumel."  I want to be sure I can
hear about all those other Tekumels, including the ones where some aspect
of "real" Tekumel doesn't hold.  I want to hear about everyone's Tekumel so
that I can make mine closer to my ideal vision of Tekumel---not Professor
Barker's.  The professor's vision carries a lot of weight, but I don't feel
it is inexorable.  My worst nightmare is that Tekumel becomes a "one true
way" kind of world.

I don't want this message to be too negative, but on the other hand, you
are in weekly contact with people who breath the very air of Tekumel, and I
am not.  I wonder if it would be possible to include people's postings in
their entirety, and to add your (or Professor Barker's) comments as an
immediately following message.

Thanks again for your efforts on the digest, and for your attention.

Thanks.  About #52, I accidentally managed to delete #52 -- ALL my copies 
of #52, through the use of a very clever and powerful batch file which I 
wrote.  It was supposed to consolidate all the pieces of Tekumelia (?) which
were scattered on my hard drive, but it got confused and in the process 
wiped out Digest #52.  I was going to call for someone on the list to send 
me another copy in the next digest (which, as usual, is woefully late).

Yes it has.  I've received several subscriptions via Gopher-searchers who 
stumbled across it.  I'll install a search indexer on it sometime, and I'd 
also like to scan in a few relevant GIF files, too.  Of course, as a member
of the Gopher software team, I can justify all this as being part of my 
product development analysis....  :-)

This has not been deliberate.  I have sensed the change in character myself,
but I think it has less to do with the layout, and more to do both with the 
hiatus and with the frequency (or lack thereof) with which I produce 
digests.  Since restoring the existence of the Digest, I have received very 
few actual letters from readers.  Frankly, I think folks simply got out of 
the habit.  Then it doesn't help that I just don't have the kind of time 
necessary to send out a digest-per-week like Brett was able to -- and since
I get fewer letters, I don't have anything to send sometimes, anyway.

>The more official the digest becomes, the more "I think Ahoggya

I think this is a very good point, and I'll try to be more sensitive to it 
subsequent mailings.  *I* certainly don't want to become The Mouthpiece of 
All that is True regarding Tekumel, nor do I want to impose my own 
worldview on the list.  I thought it would be novel having questions 
answered by Barker;  I suppose if that novelty has worn off, it starts to 
take on the air of having the President of the company hang around the 
employee lunchroom.

>...other Tekumels, including the ones where some aspect

And the game's worldview of "infinite multiverses" gives everyone's Tekumel 
validity.  Whether or not they take the same path, all Tekumel universes 
arrive at the College at the End of Time.  The only kinds that don't are 
where 1) Avanthar or another Primary Point is totally destroyed, 2) 
Tekumels which return to "our" universe.  So your point about wanting to 
see other people's Tekumels is not only esthetically pleasing, but is also 
a mandatory part of the game:  other Tekumels MUST exist.

This is certainly easier for me to do than to edit, and your point is well 
taken.  I don't THINK I've been omitting anything, but then again I may 
have.  I'm not a REAL editor, but I play one on television.  However, note 
the manner in which I'm responding to this letter, and you might see that 
the "editing" I do is no more or less than what I do to my regular mail.  
Doesn't mean I'm doing it right, but I think I'm probably guilty of acting 
out of habit than of acting out of a dictatorial mindset.

>Thanks again for your efforts on the digest, and for your attention.

Thanks for your critique.  And I PROMISE I'll get another digest out this 
week.  Really.  [Administrator's note:  Ha!]

P.S. Although you didn't write to tekumel-submit, would you mind if I 
included this discussion in the list?

The novelty certainly hasn't worn off for me!  As long as you and he are
interested, I'd love to keep hearing from him.

I think the difference is that regular mail is a conversation between two
people, whereas postings are more of a "Roman Forum" address.  When
in-posting editing takes place, the posting becomes a conversation between
the poster and the editor, rather than an address in the Forum.

>P.S. Although you didn't write to tekumel-submit, would you mind if I

Not at all.  If people have been leery of posting due to a perception of
"officialdom," this might get them going.  I plan to send in more material
to tekumel-submit myself.  (Long dormant, my Tekumel stirs; like the
Phoenix, it rises once more from the ashes!)

Subject: FUDGE

There's a generic system called FUDGE on oz.plymouth.edu under /pub/fudge.
This system might make a great way to play EPT, just that lots of conversion
is necessary, but easily doable. I'm thinking about giving it a try.
Anybody else looked at this system.

From: David Cheng (drcheng@sales.stern.nyu.edu)

I'd like to invite the _Tekumel Digest_ readers to RuneQuest-Con, to be
held in the Baltimore area on January 14-16 (MLK weekend), 1994.

Wait, you say...  Why would we want to go to a con dedicated to RuneQuest?
Well, I've noticed that there is a good bit of cross-pollination between RQ
and EPT/S&G players.  Both Tekumel and Glorantha are "premium" worlds, and
they are both favored by "sophisticated" gamers (if I may be so bold as to
say so...  :-)

I would like very much to have several EPT-related events, including a
Tekumel seminar, perhaps.  If there is enough interest, Sandy Petersen
(author of Call of Cthulhu, and several RQ products) has expressed interest
in running a scenario from his current RQ-Tekumel campaign.

Please contact me if you are interested in attending.  If would be even
better if you were willing to run some events!  GMs will get discounted
admission, of course.

Please note: you do not have to run a RQ/EPT event like Petersen.  ANY
Tekumel/EPT/S&G/etc kind of event would be great.  I have noticed
several of you play Tekumel-GURPS: bring it along, please!


On a related note:
Can anyone help me contact Andrew G Lorince?  I know he is a Tekumel-fanatic,
who (used to/still does ?) travel to cons around the Northeast with his
vanload of EPT stuff.  I tried calling the phone numbers I have, but it seems
he has moved on.  I would really like to get him to RQ-Con, because his
presence would be a real plus; he might even help us pull some of you guys
in!

Does anybody know if any plans are being made to distribute "The Eye
of All-Seeing Wonder" in other countries than the UK? The RuneQuest
fanzine "Tales of the Reaching Moon" is distributed worldwide despite
being written in the UK. It would be pretty cool if such a thing
could also be done for this EPT fanzine, possibly by TOME, possibly
by an individual.

Anybody with ideas?

Later,
Loren

 I don't know how much you know about this, but PHD Games is
apparently selling Tekumel miniatures.  I was wondering if you had hear d of
them and if you knew whether or not they were reputable/I could trust them.
They apparently just started.  Their address is P.O. Box 177/Anderson, IN
46015.

Bob Alberti replies:

It is my understanding that the owner of PHD games came about his molds
for the miniatures by entirely legitimate means, and that he has already
contacted Professor Barker and been granted permission to produce these
miniatures.  I would be interested to hear from anyone who has ordered
and received these miniatures.

The best way to send money to the UK is probably by IMO (International Money
Order) in pouinds sterling.  These cost a few bucks themselves, though
($3-$5, varies by bank; AmEx also do them), so people ordering from the UK
might want to club together and put in a bulk order to cut their costs.

Subject: Apocalypse later: more questions about Freeing Lord Ksarul
 
I am still a little confused about the keys to the Blue Room.
If they are used, they must be left on the table in the antechamber,
right?  Does that mean that the key beneath the palace in Tsatsayagga
has not been used?  Further, if wards prevent the use of the key
or prevent it from being undone, how does one go about using a key?
I assume you must find the ward (if any) that prevents use, disable
it, and transport the key to the antechamber.  If you have the ward
that prevents the key from being reversed after use, you would then
use it, otherwise the key's effect could be undone.  Any further
hints on this?
