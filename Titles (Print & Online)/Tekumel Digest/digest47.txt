Subject: Demonology

This is a response to Garbett's question on demons.
A demon that is properly summoned and made to serve has to attempt to do
what the summoner wants.  Whether or not the task is solvable by the demon
is sort of irrelevant, it has to try.  Eventually, its servitutde period 
will run out or it will no longer be able to manifest do to poor aspects
of the planes and it will go home or try to kill the summoner based on its
natural tendancy.  These are (effectively) immortal beings, so while they
don't like doing things for people, a month or two out of eternity is
not a big deal to them.  Look at the listing for Sru'karum for an example
of what happens to a summoner who keeps a demon in service too long.
There is also an example under Teklel(?) the demon that can shrink to
any size, when it was called to break into a city that had all the 
accesses warded buy the demon that guards gates.  It spent a long time 
crawling over every inch of the city till it found a crack in a sewer pipe
that wasn't protected.

I still think Ahoggya would drown alot better than they would swim...
They aren't too concerned about safety.
And I think its not so much that they are 'laid back' as they are 
'stone stupid'... look at their intelligence modifiers in S&G, most of them
wind up being on the low end of 'moron'..
