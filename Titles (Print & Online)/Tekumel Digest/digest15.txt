Administrivia:
The last issue of the digest should not have been numbered, since it contained
no submissions. The top line should have read "Tekumel Digest, Addendum".
This issue of the digest is still numbered 15. I hope this won't confuse
too many people.

Subject: Tekumel Magic

Here are a few questions I have on magic in Tekumel. I have both 

novels, the Different Worlds reprints (EPT & two sourcebooks), 

and the Book of Ebon Bindings, but not the Swords and Glory
players' book.

1) I have seen several references to a distinction between
sorcerers and shamans in the Digest postings. Is this related to
the distinction between psychic and ritual spells, or is it something
else entirely?

2) What sorts of spells are restricted to particular temples? Which
ones are generally known?

3) Is there any particular pattern to the division of spells into psychic
and ritual?
