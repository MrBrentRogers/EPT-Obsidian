Subject: Ahoggya at sea

A couple of the things to remember are that the Ahoggya are extremely 
non-religious and do not value life very high. I've heard many tales 
of Ahoggya caravans or mercenary companies trotting down the Sakbe roads, 
jostling each other as they go. Every now and again, a couple get bumped, 
nudged, thrown off the roadway to land below. If the Ahoggya survives, 
the others stop, make an Ahoggya chain over the edge - holding on to each 
other, and the one bumped off climbs up. Everyone thinks this is a big joke.
Sometimes they die, hitting their heads on the rocks below, cracking their
carapace and spilling brains. If this happens, they all still think it
is a joke, and continue on, leaving the body below.

I personally don't think that an Ahoggya can swim very well if at all, but 
I do think they can hold their breath for a fairly prodigious amount of time; 
they live in the swamps after all.

Like all sailors on Tekumel of all races, I think the Ahoggya ships are
coasters, hugging the shoreline. If they fall overboard, I'd think that
the others would think it a joke, perhaps attempt a similar kind of rescue,
but essentially leave the hapless Ahoggya, if they can't reach him before
he sinks.

More Ahoggya stuff.  Their ability to climb cliffs and the like depends
on how strong their limbs are.  If two arms and legs are enough to lift
their whole mass, they probably could climb, although I doubt they could
do so as well as humans for the simple reason that they cannot easily look
up!  I concur with EJK5's opinion on Ahoggya density; the best way to
resolve it is via some rough calculations from Swords and Glory Player's
Handbook.  Maybe someday when I have a free afternoon I'll work it out.
Dragon magazine published an article many years ago on figuring humanoid
density ("How Heavy Is My Giant?") that should give a few tips.
   EJK misses some of my argument about European mariners--before the
invention of those navigation instruments that made it relibly possible
to determine heading, latitude, and longitude, darned few sailors went far
from sight of land, because they could not find their way home again.  On
Tekumel, they possess the instruments needed, but the creatures of the deeps
makes deep-water sailing dangerous.  I would suspect most nations practice
shore-hugging sailing except for a few daredevils.  This doesn't make
Ahoggyas better sailors, but it makes shore-hugging Ahoggya sailors less
inferior to shore-hugging humans.  I also doubt they are many Ahoggya
who clamber in rigging with eyepatches and cutlasses and talking Kuni-birds
saying "Aye-aye, cap'n", but it is not beyond possibility for one or two
Ahoggya mariners.
    Mr. McLeod raises the possibility of Ahoggya swimming that allows them
to bob their face out of the water periodically to breathe.  I believe they
don't have a breathing orifice on each face, but a bobbing stroke could allow
Ahoggya to swim without the swim bladders EJK and I imagine.
   I would say, barring more concrete evidence, that Ahoggya make poor to
indifferent mariners, more adventurous that EJK would allow, but I would
concur that they probably don't swim well, if at all.

   Mr. Dean's miniatures rules sound interesting.  I'd like to hear more
about them, including where they can be obtained and at what price.  I
strongly suspect the author is the same Phil Barker, otherwise why
include Tekumel at all?  It's not a well-known universe, as far as I've
been able to tell.
