Subject: Questions about Tekumeli creatures

In trying to design Tekumeli critters for GURPS, I came up with numerous
questions based on the rather sparse descriptions given in EPT.
If anyone could help me out, I'd appreciate it.

1. Aqaa - Do they bite the victim before swallowing or just let the
   acid handle them?
2. Biridlu - do they crush the target with their bodies after the have
   enfolded them or do they just suffocate them?
3. Chashkeri - Do they have any attack beyond their "charming" personality?
4. Dnelu, Feshenga, Kurgha, Thunru'u - Do they attack with claws as well
   as bite?
5. Gerednya - How large are these creatures? 3 feet? 8 feet? 15 feet?
6. Hli'ir - What other attacks do they have beside their "rugged good looks"?
7. Huru'u - What other attacks do they have beside their "sweet-sounding voices"?
8. Hyahyu'u, Lri, Tsoggu - Do they bite and/or claw?
9. Marashyalu - Do they punch or claw as well as stick you with their proboscis?
10. Ngoro - Can they use the weapons and eyes they hold in their cilia against
   the entrapped victim(s), or just against those not trapped?
11. Qaqtla - Do they bite too?
12. Renyu - Can they wear armor?
13. Ru'un - Does this bolt-caster thingie shoot crossbow quarrel-like
   projectiles or sling stone/bullet-like projectiles? And what kind of
   rate of fire does it have? I've seen the drawing of the Ru'un with the
   blaster instead of the bolt caster. Are these separate devices held in
   the Ru`un's hand or is it part of the arm (like Captain Hook)? How
   many bolts can it fire before running out?
14. Sagun - What is the range of the spore attack? A couple feet? 6 foot
   diameter? More?
15. Shanu'u - Do they bite, claw, tail whip?
16. Sro - Can they use a tail sweep attack?
17. Tsu'uru - Can they use weapons or do they just attack with tentacles?
   Or is there some other attack I'm forgetting, like bite?
18. Vorodla - How do they attack? Weapons, claws, bite?
19. As these are described as having both male and female types, does their
   hypnosis work on anyone or just the opposite sex? How do they attack?
   Bite, claw, punch?

Any help you can give will be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
