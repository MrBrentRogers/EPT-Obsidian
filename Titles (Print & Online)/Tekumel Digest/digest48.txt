The Tekumel Digest got a reference in Lee Gold's Alarums and Excursions,
a gaming APAzine (or some such). If anyone could photocopy it for me, I'd
appreciate it greatly. I have no idea which issue.

Please put meaningful subject headers on your messages. "Tekumel Digest #40"
is not meaningful. Remember that these digests get indexed, and I pity the
poor sot who needs to find something in particular. Thank you for your

Subject:      Hlaka Religion

Garbett (digest #46) asks about Hlaka religious observances, and their
light-hearted approach to worship.  I would like to stick my oar in.
     I believe the function of worship is to knit together community.
Religious faith defines a group as a community, and separates it from
non-believing outsiders.  Regular rituals serve to sustain the community
values of the group and to knit the group together.  If you believe that
worship is more for the worshipper than for the gods, it follows that
Hlaka observance need not have any external purpose at all!  Since the
Hlakas are a light-hearted race, with little regard for solemnity of any
kind, the bandinage of their rituals are as important as the human need
for seriousness in ritual.
     My feeling is that most worship on Tekumel fits this model, and no
divine higher purpose is served by it.  However, if you prefer regular
worship to serve some divine purpose, it can be possible that the Hlaka
worship does further the end of the Hlaka race and/or divinities.  The
lack of solemnity of Hlaka rituals may be as important to their function
as "high mindedness" is crucial to human rituals.
     Finally, the Tekumel Sourcebook describes Hlaka religion as being
incomprehensible to humans.  It is entirely possible that worship to the
Hlaka does not serve any purpose that humans (including us?) can
comprehend.
