This message base is for discussion, information, and general chatter
about the world of Tekumel.

Tekumel is a fantasy world developed over 15 years ago by Professor
M.A.R. Barker for TSR's role-playing game "Empire of the Petal Throne",
originally published in 1976.  This game unveiled a world of great
complexity and authenticity that has captured the imaginations of many
and profoundly influence the development of gaming worlds throughout the
hobby.

Through this board I hope to expand interest in Tekumel, as well as show
current events in my own campaign through the use of "dispatches" from
characters in Tekumel to their peers, superiors, subordinates, and loved
ones.

May you go in power and peace!

    Thanks for the hard work, Bill.  I've just dl'ed the files. I'll
take a look at them.

    BTW, we had an idea about spell backfire, which seems a little to
high in the basic Dragon Quest system to fit my perception of the m!C·†þË$UY­][Y¶.  Our compromise was that all spells backfired on a % roll of
96 minus the rank of the spell.  Thus, a rank 10 spell backfired on a 86
or less.  Of course, if the weight limit of metal is exceeded, there
would be an automatic backfire.  What do you think?

    Your suggestion for backfire seems reasonable. Bear in mind that
under the modified system minor backfires when they do occur will be
more significant that in straight DQ. This is because with casting cost
ranging from 1-10 instead of 1-2 double and triple casting costs now
become very significant (as they should).
    Another question is that of initial spells for spell casters. My
suggestion is that priests recieve all of the Universal spells at their
level and Generic spells at half the rank they eligable to learn them
at. Temple spells must be bought with xp.
 EXAMPLE If
the GM decided to start priests at 5th circle a starting priest would
know all universal spells at rank 2 and all Generic spells of his temple
at rank 2. He would not begin knowing spells above G2.
    Lay priest might recive further reductions to represent their lack
of temple support. Your comments as always are welcome.

    Allowing a priest to know all spells available at his rank is
certainly one way of starting characters.  I, personally, like to see
characters start a little less powerful at the start, but reward them
with enough xp to allow a reasonable progression of power.  It really is
matter of taste.

    Come to think of it, I haven't look to see how many spells are
available to a Fifth Circle priest (or lay priest).  Perhaps it would
change my mind.  I'll check it out and get back to you.

Kelian, have you counted your pocket change lately?

    Your in luck, Elias (and not, as well).  Bill is planning to run a
Message-base Tekumel campaign here - and as such, will not be using the
DragonQuest system at all.  The good news is - no one else knows the
rules either.  The bad new is - no one else knows the rules either.
    Tekumel is an exceeding rich and detailed world, addicting and
compelling.  If you wish to learn more about it, feel free to stop by my
house on a monday night, when we run our weekly campaign.  Or pick up
one of M.A.R. Barker's books "Man of Gold" or "Flamesong" (if you can
find them).
    And of course, you could always stop by the Complete Strategist in
Falls Church and ask for "Tekumel Stuff".  Tell em Bill Cumberland sent
you.  If Bill is working that day, I'm sure he'd get a good laugh from
that!

    Remember Uthoi started out as an "Underworld Expert" and he never
got time to curl up with a trashy book. Instead the bozos from the
temple of Chegara were always asking if he could come out and play.
Worse they convince his licencea that he needed exercise and fresh air.

    The system I will be using for this game will be a little different.
Players will never see numbers for their character. Instead of
generating a charachter with dice or points simply give me as detailed a
description of your charachter as you can. I will then create the
charachters and you will find out that you are extremely strang and
quite talented with a sword but have been trained in all common
weapons. You are noted for your collection of sherds from the time of
the fisher kings, etc.
    This leads to very simple mechanics you tell me what you are doing
and forget about rules. The only partial exception to this is magic. To
be a magic user you must get a spell list. This can be obtained through
Swords and Glory v2 (out of print) or Adventures in Tekumel v 1 and 2.
If you have neither of these we can try to get you a Xerox. In any case
take the descriptions with a grain of salt. Tekumel was set up for most
attack spells to be save or die but I do not run them that way.
    For this, my first attempt at Tekumel and Message based gameing,
player characters will be human, Tsolyani, worshippers of
Vimuhla, connected to the temple in some way and of high or (possibly)
very high clan. The campaign will begin in the city of Jakalla.
    I hope this gives people enough to start thinking about their
characters.

   Well I remember!  Kelian is very impressed by Uthoi, and considers
him his mentor.  Oddly enough, he is proud to be "following in Uthoi's
footsteps", and so never needs urging to delve in the underworld (very
un-Uthoi like!).

   Perhaps his early life was too contaminated by contact with family &
clan members who followed Chegarra, his love of learning
notwithstanding.

    I am Chegrakka hi Kuyoga, of the Clan of the Red Sun.  I am told I
bear a strong resemblence (physically) to my father, who was once a
mighty warrior in his own right, and even knew the reknown warrior-poet
and notorious swordmaster Valar the Dismemberer personnally!
    My father, alas, in keeping with his god's love of statecraft has
pursued a political career, and is now governer of Jakalla.
    I of course am a TRUE warrior, and like so many of my clan follow
Lord Vimulah, all praise the glorious flame!
    I am described as bold, vain, and headstrong.  I am a ferocious
warrior, and a relentless, implacable foe.  I always strive towards
nobility of action (i.e. remaining true to my nature), even (or even
especially) at the expense of wisdom.
    I am very skilled as a swordsman, having access to the finest
training available.  Even at my age, I am stronger than 3 men.
    Although clever, I am usually my own worse enemy.  I have a quick
temper, and tolerate no insults.  I have no great interest in learning
per se, but am fascinated by the Epics and poetry (in Tsolyani, of
course) about battle and adventure.  Alas, I have no talent as a
magician whatsoever.

    I had the great fortune at Gencon to play a session of "Swords and
Glory" with a member of Phil Barker's (aka M. A. R. Barker) campaign.  I
asked him several questions as to the current state of affairs, and
became very enlightened.

    Basically, the war with Yan Kor came to an end, and both Eselne and
Mirusiya became embroiled in events in Paya Gupa and Fasiltum,
respectively.  The Mu'ugalavyani were taking advantage of the perceived
confusion in the Empire to regain the Chakas, lost by them at the end of
the Great War of 2,020 A.S.  Eselne was dispatched to repell the
invaders.

    Prince Mirusiya was sent to Fasiltum to put down (yet another)
uprising by the Vriddi Clan, who were having secessionist tendencies.
While both of the front runners were at opposite ends of the Empire, and
far from Bey Su or Avanthar, the unthinkable happened.

    His august majesty, the "Throne Upon Whom the Universe Rests," died
peacefully in his sleep.  (And if you believe that I've some swampland
near Penom to sell you.)  The priesthoods called for the Kolumejalim,
the Choosing of the Emperor.  Strangely enough, only one prince, the
youngest son Dhichune, stepped forward to take the challenge.  The other
heirs were either too far away to arrive in time for the contest, bribed
not to enter the contest, or were threatened with "gifts" of small clay
coins (see Sarku Temple spells (*shudder*)).

    With only one contestant, the priesthoods declared Dhichune the
winner by default, and he ascended the Petal Throne under the throne
name of "Eternal Splendor."  (Anytime a worshipper of Sarku talks about
eternal, he means it.)  Fortunately, or unfortunately, all of the heirs
were still alive and kicking.

    Currently (as of GenCon), the new emperor is rapidly replacing
important posts throughout the Empire with followers of the Eternal
Worm.  Civil unrest has been reported in several cities, including the
capital, Bey Su.  The situation seems to still be rather fluid, and no
one knows exactly will happen next.

    I plan to try to get in contact with Barker's group again to
establish some sort of conduit into events in Barker's world.

    Sorry about the long post.  Any questions? (Long stunned silence.)

OK, well I thought it was about time I tossed my two cents into the
ring...  First I should say, I have stayed out of the debate on the
starting magic and how magic works because I haven't been paying
attention, being a fighter type I didn't really care, and with other
things going on in my life I just didn't have time to spend reading
things that weren't useful to me... but I think I can comment now
because I am coming from the perspective of one who has seen how these
fledgling mages have been handling themselves, relative to the other
characters in the game... and I have noticed some things, (excuse my if
I restate some things that may be common knowledge to some of you, I
just want to hit all the points).

Mages can't wear a really useful amount of armor, so they are
going to have to rely heavily on their spells becuase they can't get in
close to battle... which is ok, that's the way mages are supposed to
be... the half-breed can fight with a weapon, but is not nearly as good
as the pure fighters, which is good again, but I have noticed that the
mages have the feel of being a little better off than a first level mage
in AD&D... you know, I better make this one spell work, because that's
it!!  I have noticed that Cristo has (to my knowledge) only used
Eliciatation (?sp?), Rick has used Radiant Gaze, and Brian has only used
spells on one or two occasions... which leads me to believe that the
mages don't have as many options as they should, to keep the game
interesting for them as well... true they are not High Level Mages yet,
but they should at least have the option to do things, and Brian is a
good example of someone who has not had (for what I have seen) many
options available, apparently because he bought a few spells just a bit
too high to be able to afford anything else... Rick doesn't seem to be
having any problems, but Cristo has again, only casted one spell that I
have seen... but I have tied things up enough with this message... you
got my 2 cents (turned out be more like 200 cents, but hey!)...

    Another interesting option would be to give priests a number of
Universal spells equal to their circle and a number of Generic spells
equal to half their circle, plus one temple spell all at minimum rank.
Using this system the priest would still have plenty to learn, but start
with enough spells to be a usefull and interesting character. I would
also limit total ranks in free spells to one and a hlf to two times his
circle so that some U2s and U3s etc could be in the mix.
    It has been my experience that having starting characters in DQ who
know the entire body of general spells and rituals has not unballanced
the game but does make spell casters more interesting than the AD&D one
trick pony. If a referee feels spell casters are too powerfull consider
the Adventures in Tekumel rule that states a spellcaster cannot ware or
carry any weapon if he wishes to use ritual spells.

A question or two in return: do you have any preferences for character
vocations (professions, whatever one wants to call them) or religions
(i.e., followers of the Tlomitlanyal or Tlokiriqaluyalonly, etc.);
also, do you have an aversion to nonhuman characters, or any guidelines

         See messages 24 and 56 which was meant as your reply but I
replied to the wrong message. I am flexable as to professions. I picked
the temple of Vimulha as one which has plenty of room for both fighters
and sorcerors. It can also handle just about anything else needed.

of the clan of the Sweet Singers of Nakome, and a tirrikamu in the
Legion of the Lord of Red Devastation, the 18th Imperial Medium

being on leave from his legion following a brief recuperation from
wounds suffered in a triflingskirmish with a band of Milumanayani
guerillas (hah, dung beetles, more like!)  He is most upset over the
fallen hopes of Prince Mirusiya and the news from Fasiltum.

        Your father believed that all young men should first serve as a
common soldier before taking the rank as an officer that will be your
eventual destiney. Therefore instead of buying you a rank he gave you a
steel breastplate when you entered the 21st Medium Infantry the Storm of
Fire. You have served in this legion for six years but were put on
indefinate leave when the new emporer Dichun'ne hiTlakotani the Eternal
Splendor reduced the legion to its peace time compliment. You naturally
came to Jakalla where you found out just how many unemployed soldiers
there were. You therefore gratefully accepted a position as Trittikamu
in the temple of Vimulha. You were quickly initiated and promoted to a
fifth circle warrior priest.
        You are 23 years old and have four brothers Aitlo 19, and
Kijam 21 are both in the 18th MI Legion of Red Devistation while
Unais 20 is an adminstrative priest of Vimuhla in Fasiltum where
you grew up. Your older brother Kedhim is working in the Pallace
of Ever Glorius War in Jakalla. You also have two sisters Ochsu
24 is married and lives in Fasiltum, Ochiha 28 (the mean one)
has declared herself Aridani and is a ritual priestess of
Cheteng.
        You were educated in the temple school where you learned to read
and write as well as a smattering of history. Growing up you learned
athletics, brawling, wrestling, falconry, and the warrior epics you like
so much. In the legion you learned the basics of all melee weapons and
became quite skilled with the two handed axe that is the weapon of your
legion although you are almost as skillful with a sword and shield. You
also learned the skills that go with being a soldier. In addition your
Tirrikamu picked you as man with promise and taught you a bit of High
Cartography.

        These are the details I have filled in for your character. If
you have objections or would like to changhe something let me know.

Mottan hiKhanuma was educated at the temple school where he learned to
read and write Tsolyani and the basics of being a soldier. He was then
enlisted in the Legion of Red Devistation and with the support of his
clan quickly became a Tirrikamu. He is well versed in training and drill
as well as the various formations used by the Tsolyani forces. He has
been twice honored for his tactical brilliance in the field. He has also
found the time to study the classic works of military history and shows
all the promise of an officer to be. He is most skilled with the two
handed sword favored by his legion but he is also skilled with sword and
shield. Growing up he spent most of his time working with weapons but
did take some time to learn spear hunting and falconry.

Mottan is 20 years old and has two younger sisters the older of whom is
married and living in Fasiltum. While on leave in Jakalla he is staying
in the clan house of the Red Sun since his own clan has no facilities in
Jakalla.

This should give you some idea of your character. You did not express
any interest beyond being a warrior. A hobby or two could be in order.
If there is anything you object to or wish to change let me know .

      Alas, I have not read 'Man of Gold' or 'Flamesong' recently
enough to remember all the details, nor do I have any of the spell-
books you mentioned...
      But, you seem to need either a mage, priest, or possibly a
thief? BTW, do people have strange talents in EPT? I suppose I
should read the source material before I begin...
      You do have some material such as the pantheons, and other races
and some description of Jakalla? (I presume that's where we'll be
starting out.) Material I might D/L?
      As for the strange talent, I just want my character to be able
to understand and make herself understood by any being capable of
language. She's also very good sneaking around and hiding in
shadows, but that's more of a skill than anything else...

AR> * SLMR 2.1a * Life is not all lovely thorns and singing vultures.

        In answer to your questions psychic powers other than spells are
not known in Tekumel and no such power as being understood in every
language is possible. Indeed scholars have been trying for centuries to
understand the language of the Ssu and the Hluss, and it is known that
humans are incapable of producing the sounds neccessary for the language
of the Pe Choi or the Ahoggya. Further examples of secret and lost
languages can be found in the sourcebooks. Secondly as to thieves no
member of a medium much less high clan would become a thief. With thier
food and lodging provided by the clan they would never do such an
ignoble thing. This does not prevent a scholar priest from having
obtained skill in picking locks and hideing in shadows, especially if
said priest were considered an underworld expert.
        I would strongly suggest that before you create a character you
at least read the Tekumel Sourcebook volumes I and II, they are still in
print and available through your better game stores. The Compleat
Strategist in Falls Church has both in stock currently. Rereading the
novels will also give you an idea of what the world is like. Due to the
bulk of material I am not going to try to upload a short summary.If you
wish to run a spellcaster you would have to obtain both volumes 1 and 2
of Adventures in Tekumel to get the spell list. It will also give you
some background material.

You suggested I might wish to reveal more of my personal interests an
accomplishments.  My reading on tactics and the proiior service of
several of my fathers in the Legion (the Legion of the Lord of Red
Devastation has always been tTe he Legion to me) caused me to take an
interest in the history of the Legion, of which I     have read much,
and thus ineluctably to the stories of the Legion during the time of
the First Imperium and the days of the Priestkings of Engsvan hla
Ganga.  Thus has necessitated some study on my part of the ancient
tongues of these times, and here and there I have picked up little
mementos of the Legion (including a not-too-bad repro of the Image of
Flame coin mentioned in the Legion's early history). I have also
acquired some small familiarity with architecture and calligraphy of
times gone by; these sidelines have also been fed by my interrest in
the history of the worship of the All-Consuming One. During my service
in the Land of the Sand Fleas, I picked up a little of their base
dialect, but only enough to curse their horrid windswept country.  My
only other major pastime is the Hirilakte arena, with which I have a
more-than-passing familiarity, owing to the frequent occasions that I
and some of my fellow soldiers have had to settle differences of
opinion with members of the sGolden Sunburst Legion.

BCÇAR> * SLMR 2.1a * Life is not all lovely thorns and singing vultures.

BCÇ        In answer to your questions psychic powers other than spells are
BCÇnot known in Tekumel and no such power as being understood in every
BCÇlanguage is possible. Indeed scholars have been trying for centuries to
BCÇunderstand the language of the Ssu and the Hluss, and it is known that
BCÇhumans are incapable of producing the sounds neccessary for the language
BCÇof the Pe Choi or the Ahoggya. Further examples of secret and lost
BCÇlanguages can be found in the sourcebooks.

     I just bought a copy of 'Man of Gold', and I might mention that
the main character could speak Pe Choi. Secondly, despite whatever the
rulebooks might say, Prof. Barker's tale implies that Telepaths are
fairly common. Thirdly, I didn't say in all languages, nor imply
literacy. The overall effect would appear to an observer that she
spoke whatever language was most familiar to her listener with a
pronounced (but understandable) accent with a few odd constructions.
This would require some cooperation on the part of the person she
wished to communicate with, and beings such as the Ssu or the Hluss
would probably not want to...BTW, what exactly was Harsan doing when
he "put things around the corner?" I don't recall anything like that
in the sourcebooks. (It's been a while, though.)


BCÇSecondly as to thieves no
BCÇmember of a medium much less high clan would become a thief. With thier
BCÇfood and lodging provided by the clan they would never do such an
BCÇignoble thing.
      My D&D background is showing here...
BCÇThis does not prevent a scholar priest from having
BCÇobtained skill in picking locks and hideing in shadows, especially if
BCÇsaid priest were considered an underworld expert.
      Well... I liked 'Man of Gold' and I wanted to have a character
with a background somewhat like Harsan's, except she spent some time
with the Mihalli, and possibly hails from another plane. Of course
this means she doesn't fulfill the social part of the character
guidelines, but since I'm not that familiar with Tekumel, or the
Tsolyani empire... (Last time I got into a game, we spent three hours
rolling up a character, and the group collapsed before we got out of
the temple. Somehow our army managed to include a pastry chef and
three or four concubines...)

BCÇ        I would strongly suggest that before you create a character you
BCÇat least read the Tekumel Sourcebook volumes I and II, they are still in

      Tell the truth, I'm not sure how well the type of character I

AR>BCÇAR> * SLMR 2.1a * Life is not all lovely thorns and singing vultures.

AR>BCÇ        In answer to your questions psychic powers other than spells are
AR>BCÇnot known in Tekumel and no such power as being understood in every
AR>BCÇlanguage is possible. Indeed scholars have been trying for centuries to
AR>BCÇunderstand the language of the Ssu and the Hluss, and it is known that
AR>BCÇhumans are incapable of producing the sounds neccessary for the language
AR>BCÇof the Pe Choi or the Ahoggya. Further examples of secret and lost
AR>BCÇlanguages can be found in the sourcebooks.

AR>     I just bought a copy of 'Man of Gold', and I might mention that
AR>the main character could speak Pe Choi. Secondly, despite whatever the
AR>rulebooks might say, Prof. Barker's tale implies that Telepaths are
AR>fairly common. Thirdly, I didn't say in all languages, nor imply
AR>literacy. The overall effect would appear to an observer that she
AR>spoke whatever language was most familiar to her listener with a
AR>pronounced (but understandable) accent with a few odd constructions.
AR>This would require some cooperation on the part of the person she
AR>wished to communicate with, and beings such as the Ssu or the Hluss
AR>would probably not want to...BTW, what exactly was Harsan doing when
AR>he "put things around the corner?" I don't recall anything like that
AR>in the sourcebooks. (It's been a while, though.)


AR>BCÇSecondly as to thieves no
AR>BCÇmember of a medium much less high clan would become a thief. With thier
AR>BCÇfood and lodging provided by the clan they would never do such an
AR>BCÇignoble thing.
AR>      My D&D background is showing here...
AR>BCÇThis does not prevent a scholar priest from having
AR>BCÇobtained skill in picking locks and hideing in shadows, especially if
AR>BCÇsaid priest were considered an underworld expert.
AR>      Well... I liked 'Man of Gold' and I wanted to have a character
AR>with a background somewhat like Harsan's, except she spent some time
AR>with the Mihalli, and possibly hails from another plane. Of course
AR>this means she doesn't fulfill the social part of the character
AR>guidelines, but since I'm not that familiar with Tekumel, or the
AR>Tsolyani empire... (Last time I got into a game, we spent three hours
AR>rolling up a character, and the group collapsed before we got out of
AR>the temple. Somehow our army managed to include a pastry chef and
AR>three or four concubines...)

AR>BCÇ        I would strongly suggest that before you create a character you
AR>BCÇat least read the Tekumel Sourcebook volumes I and II, they are still in
AR>BCÇprint and available through your better game stores. The Compleat
AR>BCÇStrategist in Falls Church has both in stock currently. Rereading the
AR>BCÇnovels will also give you an idea of what the world is like. Due to the
AR>BCÇbulk of material I am not going to try to upload a short summary.If you
AR>BCÇwish to run a spellcaster you would have to obtain both volumes 1 and 2
AR>BCÇof Adventures in Tekumel to get the spell list. It will also give you
AR>BCÇsome background material.
AR>BCÇ                                         Good Luck
AR>BCÇ                                         Bill Cumberland

AR>      Tell the truth, I'm not sure how well the type of character I
AR>have in mind would fit...

AR> * SLMR 2.1a * The first cup of coffee recapitulates phylogeny.

        It is true that Harsen was able to speak a little of the Pe Choi
language, but this was a very special case and he was limited both
because he could not make many of the sounds and because he was a
cripple (only two hands).  Telepathy is possible as a spell but it is
such a specialised spell that it turns those who have it into npcs who
spend their time in the network of telepaths the temples maintain to
send emergency messages from city to city.
        It is also certainly true that Barker is his novels have his
characters do things that are either not mentioned in the rules or
stated to be impossible. He also makes mistakes as when the priestess of
Dlamlish is disquised as a good caln girl worshiping Avanthe but says
she is of the clan of the emerald kirtle which worships Dlamlish instead
of the blue kirtle which worships Avanthe. As Harsen who was looking for
evidence failed to pick up on such a basic clue it is assumed that
Barker simply made a mistake that he failed to pick up on.
        The Mihali served the Yan Koryani because of a special type of
binding explained better in Flamesong. As characters need to be Tsolyani
to function in the game that rules out a background concerning the
Mihali. Likewise a character from another plane is right out. The great
part about Tekumel is that you can get a wonderfully rich background
using the normal system, yet you seem to be fighting to get a character
with abilities that no beginning character will have. Try to enjoy one
of the most detailed worlds around and create a character within the
guidelines provided and I think you will find no end of possibilities.

        It is a pleasant evening on Surunra the first of Langala. The
new emporer Dhiich'une hiTlakatoni "Eternal Splendor" has been on the
petal throne at Avanthar for some 9 months now. In the city of Jakalla
at the clanhouse of the Red Sun Chegrakka hiKuyoga and the clan-guest
Mottan hiKhanuma are sitting on a patio listening to an interesting tale
told by Ulchak hiKlughgai of the clan of the Red Stone a Hereksa in the
temple of Vimuhla.
        "I have heard of a most interesting discovery. A new enterance
into previously unexplored areas of the pyramid temple of the lost king,
whose named is erased from all monuments by his wife Queen Larayn. Now
it is said that if one were to make his way to the main burial chamber
and put a kirgal in each eye of the smiling face carved into the bier
that a secret pasage would open. Of course the temple could not involve
itself in anything the newly influential tomb guards could see as grave
robbing or desecration, still much ancient knowledge can be gained in
ancient places, especially those that remain largely undisturbed. I
certainly would not wish to seem to be encouraging hot heads to disturb
such a place, which is why I would only tell those who have reached the
rank of Tirrikamu this tale still it is an interesting one I am sure you
agree. Well I must be on my way. May the Maker of Thunders be ever in
your hearts."
        You know that Ulchak hiKlughgai is one of the four Hereksas
in your temple and is a member of the politicaly active Society
of the Incandecent Blaze. He is  a clan brother of your own Hereksa the
politicaly neutral Johlunkh hiPozpol.

Sorcerer, since neither of us use magic.  Additionally, he will get
together some basic suppies for underworld delving, such as a sturdy
Chlen hide crowbar, a good bullseye latern, spikes, rope, candles, etc.

    He will also go to view the Toomb by day, drawing a rough map of the

of the drawing will be noted in paces in the legend.

        Daudne hiVeshron of the clan of the white crystal, fifth circle
ritual priest of Lord Vimuhla and possessed of the "gift", has agreed to
join Mottan and Chegrakka in their study of the tomb of the lost king.
Thus a few days latter you enter the city of the dead in the morning and
proceed to the burial chamber in the tomb of the lost king. There you
find a massive stone crypt butted against one wall. Set into the wall is
a smileing face much like the masks of the Ksarulites. An inscription in
Engvenyali states, "Here lies the Ever Glorious
master of the fifteenth circle and beloved of the Ancient Lord of
Secrets. May all praise his name and his memory be eternal." The name
has been neatly effaced and mortered over so that no trace remains.
Finding yourself alone you place a copper kirgal in each eye hole and
there is a soft click then nothing... A moment later with a grinding
sound the crypt slides into the wall leaving a dark stairway going down.
        You go down about fifty feet and step on a stone which clicks
and the crypt returns to its original position. You quickly discover
that stepping on it again will open it again so closing the crypt you
head down. You have gone down along way and you believe that you are
well below ground when the stairway comes down in the middle of a room
that you estimate to be about 10 dhaiba square double doors lead south
and a single door leads north.

        You leave through the north door and proceed for about five
dhaiba up a corridor and find another door.  Opening it you find a vast
room that your lantern will not fully illuminate. It is dominated by a
stone statue of of a mason swinging a hammer. The room has many boxes
which have been forced open and the cloth that was once their contents
lies rotting on the floor the skittering of mice can be heard.
       Examination reveals the room to be 20 dhaiba wide by 30 deep  and
there are murals on the walls in the style of the priest-kings. On the
east wall is a depiction of a priest in the copper and brown of Lord
Sarku. He is working on a text and in the background two of the winged
vorodla can just be seen. To the north an Engsvenyali judge is passing
sentance on the priest. To the west the laboratory has been sealed and a
workman is applying plaster to the wall. To the south the two vorodla
can be seen flying in the sky, one has a small child in its arms; below
them are the upturned heads of many people dressed in Engsvenyali
fashion. There are two (seperate) doors in the east and one in the north
in addition to the south door that you entered through.
        A carefull search reveals three chlen hide swords one of which
is broken and a couple of broken crossbow bolts.

        The perception of energies spells reveal that yes, both the
hammer and the sealed doorway are enchanted. When the hammer is lightly
tapped against the seal the hammer shatters and the bricks of the seal
turn to sand and flow out over the floor. Two vorodla, oddly misshapen
flying creatures created by rearanging the bodies of human beings come
advancing upon you. The nearer one strike with its claws at Chegrakka
and sparks fly as it connects with his midsection. Not for the first
time Chegrakka thanks his father for his magnificient gift of a steel
breastplate.   The other vorodla moves toward Duadne.

from his eyes (hopefully) striking the Hated Undead, as he casts Radiant
Gaze at the foul creation.

    Chegrakka swings his mighty axe smashing into the leg of his target
and doing significant damage. The other Vorodla has an even worse time
being hit squarely by Mottan with his two handed sword in the upper
torso while Duadne's radiant gaze incenerates its head. The creature on
Chegrakka is flapping its wings to support its weight without the use of
one leg as a result it does not get an attack this round. This will
probably prove its undoing as the other creature has collapsed on the
floor headless. Unless you particularly want a Vorodla prisoner you can
assume victory.

he uses a sword?)

BCÇ        It is true that Harsen was able to speak a little of the Pe Choi
BCÇlanguage, but this was a very special case and he was limited both
BCÇbecause he could not make many of the sounds and because he was a
BCÇcripple (only two hands).  Telepathy is possible as a spell but it is
BCÇsuch a specialised spell that it turns those who have it into npcs who
BCÇspend their time in the network of telepaths the temples maintain to
BCÇsend emergency messages from city to city.
BCÇ        It is also certainly true that Barker is his novels have his
BCÇcharacters do things that are either not mentioned in the rules or
BCÇstated to be impossible. He also makes mistakes as when the priestess of
BCÇDlamlish is disquised as a good caln girl worshiping Avanthe but says
BCÇshe is of the clan of the emerald kirtle which worships Dlamlish instead
BCÇof the blue kirtle which worships Avanthe. As Harsen who was looking for
BCÇevidence failed to pick up on such a basic clue it is assumed that
BCÇBarker simply made a mistake that he failed to pick up on.
      Or possibly that Harsan didn't know who was who among the clans.
Barker's intent may have been to forwarn readers who might know about
this. After all, as you say, the Emerald kirtle is known to worship
Dlamelish, and Eyil hiVryen is her priestess...

BCÇ        The Mihali served the Yan Koryani because of a special type of
BCÇbinding explained better in Flamesong. As characters need to be Tsolyani
BCÇto function in the game that rules out a background concerning the
BCÇMihali. Likewise a character from another plane is right out. The great
BCÇpart about Tekumel is that you can get a wonderfully rich background
BCÇusing the normal system, yet you seem to be fighting to get a character
BCÇwith abilities that no beginning character will have. Try to enjoy one
BCÇof the most detailed worlds around and create a character within the
BCÇguidelines provided and I think you will find no end of possibilities.

      That's the problem, I don't have the books, and I don't know
when I can get them. As for the 'beginning character' bit... This may
be just neurosis on my part, but for the last five years, I've never
seen a campaign last more than a month or two. Perhaps I should stay
out of this one 'cause if I come in, I *know* it's going to break

BCÇit is said that if one were to make his way to the main burial chamber
BCÇand put a kirgal in each eye of the smiling face carved into the bier
BCÇthat a secret pasage would open. Of course the temple could not involve
BCÇitself in anything the newly influential tomb guards could see as grave
BCÇrobbing or desecration, still much ancient knowledge can be gained in
BCÇancient places, especially those that remain largely undisturbed. I
BCÇcertainly would not wish to seem to be encouraging hot heads to disturb

    This campaign (the message campaign) is an extension of one that
started years ago in Texas.  I have been in it six years, as has Bill -
and we had to put up with all sorts of stories about stuff that went on
in the campaign before us.

        You enter a pentagonal room, five dhaiba on a side. In this
        room is a mat, a desk and a small statue of a five headed
        serpent. The floor, walls, and ceiling are all clad in copper.
        There are dark stains spattered on the copper and human bones
        are scattered about the room, on closer inspection they appear
        to have been scorched by fire. Inspection of the staue reveals
        nothing unusual until Mottan discovers a secret compartment in
        its base. Opening the compartment you find a strange device. It
        is made of chlen hide and copper and fits in the palm of your
        hand. It appears to be a compass with a copper strip for a
        finger on either side of the display and a button facing away
        from the two copper strips. The needle does not point in a
        particular direction. In one corner of the room is a hole that
        seems to have been used for sanitary purposes. A skylight has
        been cut into the ceiling providing illumination. On the desk is
        a document in Engsvenyali it is quite thick and will take some
        time to translate, also it is not in the best of shape. Other
        than this all you find are some pens, ink and a sand block.

the sound to have come from. Further people moving about the room
searching does not cause the bell to sound again.

"'Easier in than out,' as the chlen said in the skinning pen." Mottan
would like to invesigate the possibility that the interesting sound
might be related to our means of egress, i.e., does the door we just
came through still open; and if so, is there anything noxious coming
out of the "sewage drain"?  Myself, I hate the sound of bells; it makes
me think of the dreaded ssu! The only ringing I enjoy is the sound of
the chimes of the skulls and bells upon the walls of far-off Fasiltum,

    I was going back through the TOME rule set for Tekumel (the new
ones) and I must say that in many ways I was impressed.  While it has
its silly aspects such as aircar collecting as a hobby. It appears to be
the first skill based system for Tekumel. My major objection is that
since Stats are rolled one cannot be assured of having a character of
the type he wishes to play. Never the less this is not an insurmountable
problem and I will be looking at the rules when they come out very
carefully since it would be nice to be using the same system as other
people for transportability. Also notice that to get a single generic
spell in the system it is neccessary to get twenty universal spells and
that circle as a sorcerer is based on the number of spells known (5 per
circle).

    In reality, the new rules seem to mostly be a re-hash of the
(incredibly unplayable) Swords and Glory.  I do agree that there is a
lot of good source material and useful tables and lists to round out a
character very nicely.

    I agree that random characteristic generation is a real drag, I
think that you could probably come up with a point-based system where
you buy your characteristics instead of relyin on Lady Niyunen, the
Giver of Unlooked-For Wealth (and stats).

Oh, all right! If he's going to hold onto the little compass dingy, he
can't be surprised if we get the direction wrong! So let's see if we
can pull up a flagstone or two (or whatefer the floor's made of) .
<<suiting action to words, Mottan worries at the floor-paving>> And
while we're at it, somebody look at the ceiling! Just our luck if
something dropped on us while we played with the floor. It's probably
something ethereal, or whatever. Can't the priest tell if there's
something magical or otherwordly about the corridor (besides the fact
that this thing keeps pointing at it...) (It's probably marking the spot
where three heroes from the Overworld spent the rest of their lives
running about in circles...)

    Daudne also remember this particular passage, and suggests to his
zealous companion that perhaps the device *detects* traps, and thus
destroying flaggings will avail us nought.  Instead, we should more
closely examine our immediate surroundings to discover the nexus of the
compass.

    Additionally, Daudne will again cast Perception of the Energies in
the corridor.

    The new Tekumel Bestiary has just come out and looks quite good.
With very little change it can be used for Dragonquest as well as the
new mostly unpublished rules. For instance the armor factor and damage
produced both translate directly to DQ, though the hit points need to be
adjusted somewhat.

excellent target in the now unprotected chest and lunges at it sinking

knocking the back. It collapses half in and half out of the nexus point

wound.

we have performed gloriously today, and can bask in the warmth of our

    Chegrakka has two serious wounds one to the arm and one to  the leg.
Daudne is feeling a significant loss of Pedhetal from the spells he has
cast. In addition the fighters are aware that in about an hour or so
when the last of the battle rush wears off, the sleep demons will likely
come and visit them. Takeing stock you also notice that the demon
dropped his sword before falling into the nexus point, it looks like it
would be inconvient to use as the hilt is a ball about six inches in
diameter, however it would make a nice trophey.

have no burning desire to keep it, but the copper Opener of Portals to

maybe the next portal we find will lead somewhere less unpleasant.)
And how much trouble will we encounter in marketing such artifacts,

    Well said, Lord Motten.  I myself agree that the Opener of Nexus

agree, I will speak with our scholar-priests to ascertain its further
workings.

    The device was created by a priest of Sarku the needle will point to
the nearest nexus point to a range of about five dhaiba, when it gets
to within half a dhaiba it gives two signals. Each signal will be
either the ding of a bell or a buzzing such aas an enraged insect
makes; the ding indicates safe and a buzz indicates unsafe. The first
signal indicates whether the other side of a nexus point will sustain
human life, while the second indicates whether it will sustain the
undead minoins of the worm lord. As you have already discovered pushing
the stud opens a nexus point within half a dhaiba. It is powered by the
users pedhtal but can be used by non-sorcerers with a fair degree of
success although magic dampening creatures such as certain of the
ahoggya cannot use the item.
    The Sword is interesting in that it is made of a strange substance
that seems to be neither metal or chlen hide or any natural substance.
You are told that the temple would be willing to pay 25 Kaitar for it.

logistics, though I did put in my time in on the combat aspect of
things.
I retired from the military and joined the temple as an administrative
priest., my particlar specialty was in the area of record keeping, (not
a highly contested field but one that allows me access to information
on varying scales.)

Am I welcome to 'slum-crawl' with your noble band?

party against unexpected attacks by denizens of the tombs, and keeping
an eye open for otherwise unnoticed inscriptions, architectural oddities
or incidences of the archaic bas-relief plant ornamentation of the

the spelling and editing are poor, the contents are not bad. They center
around the campaign played by the editor, but there is also information
on Barker's campaign. In the January 93 issue a plug for Shadowlands
appeared. I am not sorry I subscribed and will be looking forward to

    From a couple of sources I have pieced together the following
Tekumel releases from TOME. In Spring we should get both Adventures in
Tekumel Vol II and Tekumel Sourcebook 3, and at GenCon in August the new
Tekumel rule set. When combined with what is already out there this will
make Tekumel a serious game in the market. If the minature line is
re-released as well we may make it off the list of orphans. Now all we
need is a national magazine.
    To help Realms of Wonder I urge people to write up Tekumel
adventures past and present. It could get you a little money and spread
the word about Tekumel.

inexcusable butchering of Salarvyani. They are highly feudal and just
on the other side of the Gilraya forest from Tsolyanu. I have mentioned

Gahh!  It may seem intemperate of me to say so, but if one is going to
*publish* something, even a lowly 'zine, it behooves one to be
punctilious and meticulous about spelling, fact-checking, etc.  If
working in a fantasy milieu (particularly one as linguistically complex
as Tekumel!) such horrendous misspellings are simply inexcuseable!

    I could not agree more. I am glad for my subscription to update
the board, but after a mistake like that I cannot reccomend it to
others. This is especially true as the 'zine is now "expanding" to cover
more than Tekumel, so there will be less Tekumel stuff in it.

    In response to a face to face message from Harashi you try the
northern most east door. The room is again five dhaiba square. In the
middle of the rear wall is a once secret door. It pivots in the center
and when the plaster was in place would have been hard to spot, however
it does not seem to have weathered ditlana as well as it could have.

        The February issue of Worlds of Wonder has come out. There are
four Tekumel features and the spelling is much improved. In addition the
author has gone to partial 9 point type. This gives the magazine a
better appearance and leaves more room for articles which is what we all
want. Unfortunately there is no update on the Barker campaign to report
but overall the issue is a big improvement.
        The Tekumel articles are The Assassins of Eternity a continuing
story, The Monster of the Month: The claw of doom, Tekumel BBS a very
nice one pager on Shadowlands and an article on an interesting new
device the Baleful Eye of the Goddess.
        With the spelling problems corrected the strengths of the
magazine are starting to show through. There are some solid ideas and
things are clearly identified as to whether they are creations of the
Aurora group or "Official Tekumel". There are some good temple maps that
could be adapted for a variety of situations. All in all I am more
enthusiastic about the magazine than I was in the past.

    To quote the noble father of Daudne:

    "Obey the letter of the Law, then do what you will."

    Daudne comments that he remembers overhearing a tomb guard, while
discussing the Governor (long may he avoid assassination) and his
companions of that bygone era, kept pointing to the third joint on his
fingers and repeating "That far, that far."  Daudne cannot remember who
this man was, or even what he looked like for that matter.

    Daudne also mentions in passing that no one has tried to kill the
Governor in over a week, now.  He feels that the Underworld is much
safer than the Palace of the Everliving Lord these days.

DOES have quite a scar on his neck . . . . .

        Well hope springs eternal. Here is the latest schedule from
TOME.

        Feb.    Beyond the Borders of Tsolyanu
        Mar.    Into The Underworld
        Mar.    Swords and Glory sourcebook V3
        Apr.    The Temple Book

        Obviously some of these are already late. In addition we
received a British magazine at the Compleat Strategist called the Last
Province. Number two has one of the more complete listings of Tekumel
Products past and present. I am expecting Realms of Wonder any day now
and will post news when it comes.

    I recieved the new Realms of Wonder and while it is mostly an April
Fools issue, this update came out on Barker's Campaign:

    A newly revealed Ksauralite Prince has led an army against Dechune
and caused him to flee. He was not able to take the petal throne.
Instead a new Kilamajlim has been called. The details will supposedly be
in the new Tome book, Beyond the Borders of Tsolyanu, due out in a
couple of weeks.

    If true, this will definitely change things!  I guess we'll just
have to wait and see if its true.  I wouldn't be a bit surprised,
though.  A new Kolumejalim throws the door open to any contender still
vying for the Petal Throne.  Mirusiya, Eselne, maybe even Mridobu (if he
is still among the living), or dear old Rereshqala.

    It will indeed be fascinating to see what comes of the new choosing.
I also wonder though about a new son of Hirkane Tlakatani being
announced after Dichune had taken the throne.

1. Is there a precedent for this?
2. Did the OAL confirm his status as a royal Prince?
3. Who was that masked man?

    The new Tekumel supplement, Beyond the Borders of Tsolyanu is here.
It looks good even though I have not found anything about the results of
the Civil War yet. Get into more trouble than you bargained for.

Barring imminent (or would that be immanent?har) objections from our
fellows, let us by all means return and examine the eastern room,
unless our worthy priest forbids such activity as tomb-robbing (which
of course no principled person would engage in, unless it were the tomb
of a despised foe, in which case it doesn't really count, does it?...)

Zakamoto- Yes we do have access to a scanner, however, The detail
needed for a copy of photo or photo was lacking.  The catalog does have
pictures.  If you would like one just leave your name and address and
I'll mail one to you.  Thank you for your comment.

Everyone,
Thank you for your response for catalogs on the Empire of the Petal
Throne figures.  One point to remember is DO NOT send a SASE as the
catalog does not fit inside.  I realize this is out of the ordinary for
someone to increase his costs, but this case works better this way.
The new Urunen figures and C  churstalli have been very popular.
That's all for now.  May all your battles be glorious.

    Would anybody who found out about this conference via my cards at
Castle Con please leave me a message. I am curious to see if we reached
anyone this way.

                                       Thanks
