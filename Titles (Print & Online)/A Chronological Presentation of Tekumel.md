**A Chronological Presentation of Tekumel, The Sidereal Universe, and The Majesty of The Empire of The Petal Throne**

  
**Originally by Shawn Bond**

**Added to by Brent Rogers**  

Author's Note: The reader will note that this chronology utilizes two dating periods, anno Domini (AD) and after Seal (AS). The calendar begins with the Christian calendar system of "anno Domini" for ease of the reader to gain a perspective of how the sequence of events that lead to Tekumel pertains to his or her own time (circa 1900's). The second calendar utilizes the Tsolyani calendar of "after Seal" which began upon the ascension of the first mythical Seal Emperor (it was felt that placing the historical perspective of Tekumel in terms of Tsolyani history would again provide a familiar frame of reference for the reader). It should also be noted that almost all of this material has been gleaned from the myriad sources of text written by Prof. MAR Barker (and a few others) over the years, and in no way should anyone construe that this humble author is taking any creative credit (though an occasional comment or suggested insight may have sneaked in here and there).

Another historical timeline is combined using the date format of Before Second Imperium (B.S.)

Current history "ends" with the civil war still raging (or perhaps simmering is a better word) in Tsolyanu, the Red Hats still holding Pan Chaka and Livyanu, and Salarvyani forces both raiding the Empire's eastern provinces and bickering amongst themselves. Additional details will be incorporated as more information comes in. My contacts in Tsolyanu (namely Tilekka hiVaishya of Jakalla and a few other adventurous "scholars") are rather busy at the moment, and I do not wish to take too much of their time.

**The Known History**  
**(Rev. 1)**  
21st Century Terra - 2012-2013 AD -  
"Western Civilization" and the nations of 21st century Terra are obliterated by the Atomic Armageddon.  

prior to 60,000 AD – (AD = anno Domini)  
Earth struggles out of the radioactive ashes and slowly rebuilds a technological civilization. Humankind again reaches for the stars and eventually encounters the Pe Choi, who gift the peoples of Earth with the Three Light Drive and many other wonderous devices, as well as introducing the fledgling interstellar species to a vast galactic community. Terrans are soon introduced to others; the Shen of Antares, the Ahoggya from Achernar, the Niniyal (Pygmy Folk) from Mirach, the Tinaliya from Algol, the Hlaka from Ensis, the Urunen from Betelgeuse, the Pachi Lei from Arcturus, the Heglethyal (Swamp Folk) from Unukalhai, the Hlutrgu from Algenubi, the Vleshgayal (Shunned Ones) from Regulus, the Mihalli from Dorsum, the Nyagga from Alhena, the Hokun from Markeb, the Chima from some unrecorded star system, the noisome tripedal Popo of Beta Aquilae, the shaggy Umpleb from Delta Aquilae, and the insiduous Bahk Muhk from Denebola. Still other species were found in the farther reaches of space, but their names and their empires have largely been forgotten.

  
early 60,000 AD -  
Tekumel is discovered by explorers from Humanspace. Its sun, Sinistra in Nu Ophiuchi, is found amongst the trade routes of several stellar empires. Economic advantages for having a mercantile base at this location outway the cost of pacifying the hostile natives and terraforming the inhospitable planet.

  
60,000-60,110 AD -  
Domination of Tekumel during the Dynasty of the Veritable Autocrator. The Autocrator's armies and fleets raze the indigenous Ssu and Hluss civilizations. Terraforming of the planet and extermination of 98% of the native life. Ssu, Hluss, and related sentient species relocated onto closely guarded preserves.

  
60,111-61,912 AD -  
Tekumel is made into a pleasure planet and trading center for Humanspace and the other spacefaring alien empires. Human and alien masters stock private animal preserves and zoos. Mighty starships bring the wealth of many worlds to the jaded merchantprinces of Tekumel. "Men sing of Tekumel as home." Such peace and prosperity is said to last almost 50,000 years.  

111,912 AD -  
The Cataclysm hurls Tekumel into a starless pocket dimension by supposed hostile forces (the Pariah Dieties perhaps?). The once great civilization of Tekumel, the Joyous Light of the Golden Age, goes dim and is extinguished. The great culture is broken in only a few hundred years. Thus do sages refer to this sad era as "The Time of Darkness."

**61,000+ AD / 30,000 B.S.** _(B.S. = Before Second Imperium)_ -

The Latter Times begins. Those that survived cataclysm hoard everything, even toiletries. Some new devices manufactured for a while. Mental techniques for drawing power from other dimensions (i.e. magic) developed.

  
111,912-111,812 AD -  
The same fate as Tekumel befalls 722 other worlds of Humanspace (it is unknown whether worlds in the empires of other alien species suffer a similar fate). It is unrecorded whether Earth falls to the ravages of the unknown enemy.

  
111,912-106,912 AD -  
The space-age civilization of Tekumel has collapsed into barbarism from geologic upheavals and disruptions of essential supplies brought by starships. The machines begin to die. The Ssu and Hluss exult in the misfortune of their enemies and take back whatever they can. Local hoarders and warlords seize everything within their power. The Hlutrgu burst upon the coastal swamplands and are only forced back after a long series of brutal and bloody wars. The Hokun pretend to befriend mankind, war with them, enslave humanity and rule them as gods, and are eventually defeated by their slaves, forcing the Hokun to retreat to a great island in the southern seas. The Mihalli civilization in the east is destroyed by a great planetary bomb used by a neighboring human kingdom (who are also destroyed by the weapon). Such is "The Latter Times."

**25,000 B.S.** -- _Empire of Llyán of Tsamra_, first known historical empire, arises and conquers what is now Livyánu and Mu'ugalavyá.

  
(106,912 AD approximate) -31,525 AS – (AS = after Seal)  
The ancient Llyan Empire (proto-Livyanu) founded by Llyan at the city of Tsamra. The sorcerers of Llyan discover the existence of nexus points, compound the texts of demonology and map the topography of the Planes Beyond. "Magic" (psychic powers of the mind) is refined from what was learned by the Great Ancients and the Lords of the Latter Times, and compilation of spells are made by the scientist-magicians of Llyan. Genetic templates for many guardian creatures and servants of mankind are fashioned using the still-functioning genetic-plasma machines of the bygone Age of Wonder. Fragmentary records indicate that worship of the Pariah Gods is widespread (The One Other, The One Who Is, and the Goddess of the Pale Bone - Ku'u Tep in the tongue of Llyan).

mid -26,000 AS / **24,000 B.S -**  
The Three States of the Triangle (Urmish, Jakalla, and Thraya) arise in power, founded in area of modern Tsolyánu.  

-23,525 AS / **23,000 B.S.** -  
Contact with Vimuhla by Llyan scholars followed by rapid spread of worship of the Lord of Fire throughout the Llyan Empire. Lesser influence of Vimuhla in the Three States of the Triangle. The Llyan Empire begins to deteriorate from political stagnation and religious zeal for the Flame Lord.

Nluss warbands (soon to be known as the Dragon Warriors) begin to migrate from their mountainous homelands, driven to plunder and conquest by the red-robed priests of Vimuhla. _The Dragon Warriors_, Vimúhla-worshipping barbarian tribesman from Nlüssa invade from the north and wipe out Llyáni empire and the Triangle. Whether the 'Dragons' of their name are actual beasts (probably Sró - see Bestiary) or ancient flying machines is subject of historical speculation.

  
beginning of -23,495 AS -  
The Dragon Warriors from the lands of ancient Nlussa conquer the city-states of what will be Mu'ugalavya, riding mighty, flying "dragons" (aircars of the ancients) and pillaging the land.  

-23,445 AS -  
The Dragon Warriors destroy the remnants of Llyan's Empire. They proto-Nluss futilely war upon the Shen states to the South, with little success other than spilling much blood of both human and alien. Dragon Warrior hordes migrate East and Northeast.

  
-23,345 AS -  
The Dragon Warriors conquer the coasts of what is now Yan Kor and wage wars with the Three States of the Triangle.

  
-23,265 AS -  
The Three States of the Triangle fall and are pillaged by the Dragon Warriors.

  
-23,245 AS -  
The Dragon Warriors march all the way through what is now Salarvya. They occassionally battle the Ahoggya (though the Dragon Warrior are loathe to enter the fetid swamplands of the aliens) and sea-faring Nom raiders.

**21,000 B.S.** -- _Empire of the Fisher Kings_ founded in modern Salarvyá, destroyed warring remnants of Dragon Lords empire. Ksárul, God of Sorcery and Secrets, is contacted.  

-23,240 AS -  
Gamulu of Fenul leads rebellion against the weak Nluss overlords in ancient Salarvya.  

-23,235 AS -  
Gamulu drives the Dragon Warriors out of western Salarvya. The empire of the Dragon Warriors fragments into thousands of clans, small states, and cities. Hordes of Ssu pour out from their refuges to make war upon humanity; their armies ravage Pechano - first capturing their long lost capital of Ssuganar and then pulling down Benesh (which never rises again) near the present city of Mechaneno. The Ssu Wars begin.  

-23,235 to 23,210 AS -  
Ssu expeditions strike northward into Chaigari and Kilalammu, threatening even the high aeries of the Hlaka. These beings make alliance with Gamulu and his people. Both sides rage back and forth for many years. This war is characterized by many campaigns with sporadic interludes. Eight of Gamulu's 14 sons fall in battle with the Foe of Man.  

-23,210 AS -  
Gamulu drives the Foe of Man back below Ssuyal, leaving fields choked with tattered gray bodies and slain human warriors. Gamulu holds a great victory celebration in the whispering ruins of old Ssuganar.  

-23,200 AS -  
Gamulu dies from a mysterious wasting disease contracted in Ssuganar (some say it is a curse laid upon him by the vengeful Ssu during his time in Ssuganar, others believe its radiation poisoning). The 12th son of Gamulu, Ho Etehltu, kills his remaining sibling rivals and is crowned as emperor, founding an dynasty later to be known as the Fisherman Kings, who commanded fleets of black ships that ranged up and down the coasts of Salarvya and proto-Tsolyanu. Ho Etehltu raids and conquers the region as far east as Peleis. He seizes the Dragon Warriors' strongholds on the islands of Ganga, Thayuri, and Vra, and his black ships besiege the city of Jakalla (though unable to take it). The Fisherman fleet crosses the straits to capture Haida Pakala from an unknown nonhuman race that then held it (Hokun?)

-23,200 to -23,000 AS -  
Contact with the interdimensional being now called Ksarul during the 22nd king of Gamulu's dynasty. Religious persecution and strife against the emerging priesthood of Ksarul by Vimuhla priests. The religious strife provides impetous to ring about the beginnings of the Bednalljan Dynasty.  

**18,000 B.S.** -- A desert clan-girl advances by intrigue, sex and assassination to be the first empress of the _First Imperium_ (or the Bednálljan Dynasties), Nayári of the Silken Thighs. It covers what is now Tsolyánu and Yán Kór. Her reign is bloody and ruthless. Her dynasty lasts 3,000 years. Hrü'ü, God of Darkness, Sárku, God of the Undead and Worms, and Dlamélish, Goddess of Perversion and Orgies, are contacted.

-23,000 AS -  
Nayari of the Silken Thighs assassinates the governor of Purdanim and quickly consolidates political power using sex and violence. The First Imperium has begun under Nayari. The rest of the Lords of Change contacted by human scholars.  

-22,990 AS -  
The last of the Dragon Warrior kingdoms outside of Nlussa falls to Nayari's able generals.  

-22,989 AS -  
The last Fisherman King flees north from Nayari's legions, signaling the end of the Fisherman Kings Empire.  

-22,988-86 AS -  
Hlutrgu assault the Island of Thayuri but are turned back after hundreds of thousands of the vicious frog-beings are slain.  

-22,986 AS -  
Fasiltum conquers the Hlaka aeries.  

-22,982 AS -  
Nayari of the Silken Thighs is assassinated by the poisoned kiss of a lover (who dies himself).  

-22,932 AS -  
Nayari's son moves the capital of the First Imperium to ancient Jakalla.  

-22,900 AS -  
Jigresh, Tiritlen of Lord Sarku, commands the demon lords Tkel and Srukarum to fashion the Maze Temple of Jigresh as a place of steadfastness for the priesthoods of Sarku and Durritlamish.  

-22,882 AS -  
Capital of the First Imperium is moved by Nayari's grandson to the newly built city, Bey Su ("Soul of the World"). The construction of the Sakbe Roads is begun, linking the cities of the First Imperium.  

-20,853 AS -  
The priest Pavar is born.  

-20,800 AS -  
The crippled Pavar, priest of Enome (Ksarul) contacts the Grey Lord Tham (Thumis), and with the remaining Lords of Stability soon thereafter.

**15,000 B.S.** - The priest Pavár on the island of Engsvan hla Gánga contacts the Gods of Stability: Hnálla, God of Light, Kárakan, God of War, Thúmis, God of Wisdom, Belkhánu, God of Protection, and Avánthe, Goddess of Family and Agriculture. His successors found a theocracy that encompasses all of the known world, the _Engsvanyáli Empire_. This is a golden age of art, scholarship and civilization that lasts 10,000 years.

  

-20,763 AS -  
Pavar dies in his sleep at the age of ninety. His disciples carry the new pantheon to the far corners of the First Imperium.

-20,700 AS -  
Civil war spreads across the land between the new and old religions (the fruits of this civil war would establish the now regional strongholds of the Pantheon of Pavar in Tsolyanu). The Scrolls of Pavar are copied and spread across the continent by delegates of the temple of Nallal (Hnalla). The Emperor of the First Imperium and his glittering court watch with apprehension to growing civil unrest. Work begins to expand the ancient citadel of Evu Nithoru (Avanthar), a stronghold since before the Time of Darkness, into the fortress it is today.  

-20,600 AS -  
The Concordat is established between the temples of Change and Stability under Ghiyal Tranuo, High Priest of Nallal on Ganga and appointed successor to Pavar. Power shifts from Bey Su to Pavar's home island of Ganga when the Emperor, Meshkanuma Amessu III invites the High Priests of the Tlomitlanyal to Bey Su to advise him. The ancient capital of the First Imperium, time lost Purdanim, has begun to fall into ruin. The Emperor is made to swear never to worship the Pariah Gods. The cities of what is now Tsolyanu have now gone over to the pantheon of Pavar. The now lost art of perfume writing is perfected during the reign of Meshkanuma Amessu III. Scholars generally agree that this is the time when Engsvan hla Ganga (wrongly called the Kingdom of the Gods by many scholars) arises as a true political power.  

-20,453 AS -  
Emperor Balakanuma I assumes the throne after the death (some say by poison or magic) of Emperor Changgala. The emperor, a devotee of Kerek (Karakan) doubles the size of the realm, seizes Milumanaya, marches along the shores of the Northern Sea, and captures Hleker (Ke'er) from descendants of the Dragon Warriors and the Lorun tribes.  

-20, 163 AS -  
Priestly advisors become the real masters of the realm at the Imperial Court of the First Imperium. The High Priest of Nallal wields as much, if not more, power as the Emperor. The affairs of government and the police were the province of Chokhar's clergy. The High Adept of Kerek had charge of the army, and trade and economic affairs were managed jointly by the temples of Evuen and Tham. The temple Vaomahl establishes its power in Fa'asal and amongst the clans in the south-western city of Thamis.  

-19,963 AS -  
Tirisan Jakona, Patriarch of Ba'alk, revitalizes the administration of Engsvan hla Ganga.  

-19,915 AS -  
The last Emperor of the Bednalljan Empire, Tarishande XIII, is spirited away from Bey Su by his remaining loyal servants. This band of political refugees flee from the pursuing contingent of Ganga soldiers across the Northern Sea to beyond the North Pole. The Empire of Ganga officially begins. The Priestkings continue to add to the network of Sakbe-roads and fortify these walls with many watch-towers and keeps, and practice the Bednalljan custom of Pashatl. The temples establish the practice of using networks of telepaths to deliver messages. Also during this era, the great scholar Waba of Ka Kokoth writes his greatest work, "The Periplus of Farther Voyaging."  

-19,763 AS -  
The legions of the Priestkings lay siege to Shoshche (Ch'ochi) in Mu'aghatl. Though the siege lasts over 20 years, the Empire of Ganga cannot invest the ancient pre-Cataclysm military base.  

-19,885 AS -  
Legend tells of a tall, sun-blackened old man who appeared in Ja'akath, speaking the "high" speech and acting in the manners of the old court of the Bednalljan Emperors. What occurs to this stranger is lost to history.  

-19,551 AS -  
The proud Veridh clan closes the gates of Fa'asal and refuses to send taxes or troops to Ganga. The Priestking Ssirandar I crossed the Vales of Ninar (now the Desert of Eyagi) and laid siege to Fa'asal, destroying its water supply and canals to force the rebelling city to capitulate. The great architect Pirunddayu builds the great shrine to Ba'alk in Fa'asal.  

-19,509 AS -  
Foundation of the first hereditary Engsvanyali dynasty by Priestking Ssirandar I. Beginning of the First Epoch.

-19,413 AS -  
Marya, the greatest Engsvanyali sculptor, creates his masterpiece, "Woman of Tsamra." The artist employed one Nia Alel, a Livyani serving maid, as the model for his renowned work. He later produces another masterpiece titled, "Thumis Ascending to the Sun" (which is currently a prized possession of the Governor of Tumissa).  

-19,315 AS -  
Priestking Bashdis Mssa II begins the tradition of the keeping of records in "The Great Book of the Priestkings" (which were closely guarded at Ganga).  

-19,262 AS -  
The Priestking Dharumesh Mssa I founds the great Library at Tumissa. This edifice is also to include an academy of devices and sciences (no trace of it exists today).  

-19,220 to -19,154 AS -  
Sometime during the reign of Ssirandar IV, the Engsvanyali epic poem, "The Lament to the Wheel of Black," is translated from Bednalljan or some older text.  

-19,154 to 19,097 AS -  
Priestking Ssirandar V, "The Victorious over the Foes of Humankind" conquers Pechano and much of the east. Priestesses of the goddess Shiringgayi help the Priestking's generals by using weapons of the great Ancients to subdue the worshippers of Hicheggeth Qurgha (Black Qarqal) in the City of Liu-Sanmu.  

-19,097 AS -  
The practice of electing a Priestking via the priestly council of Ganga is abandoned in favor of hereditary succession. The posts of High Priest and Adept are also passed on to offspring in many of the temples. Membership on the subsequent "advisory" council to the Priestkings is based upon ancestry, prestige, favors, and money.  

-19,097 to 19,094 AS -  
Priestking Ssirandar VI builds the "City of the Nine Walls" (now lost).  

-19,094 AS -  
Priestking Bashdis Mssa III, "The Great," establishes the "Circles" system of ranking amongst the priesthoods. This ruler also restores ancient Bednalljan titles and fiefs to favored subjects.  

-19,040 AS -  
Priestking Dharumesh Mssa II is poisoned by his own chamberlains who discover his "ignobilities."  

-19,040 AS -  
Priestqueen Choleyn Mssa I, the First Engsvanyali Queen. Devotee of Avanthe and patron of agriculture. The Priestqueen sets scholars to the task of increasing the bounty of the Empire's lands through magic (the temple of Avanthe retains some of these spells, but much is now lost).  

-19,028 AS -  
Priestqueen Choleyn Mssa II, daughter of Choleyn Mssa I. Worshipper of Dilinala, with 237 female lovers from all the social classes.  

-18,963 AS -  
Priestking Nemandu I, cousin of Choleyn Mssa II and founder of a new line.  

-18,663 (approx.) AS -  
The temples of Sarku, Gruganu, and Vimuhla revolt against the Priestkings. A treaty between Ganga and the City of Sarku grants most of the autonomy of Sarku's temple in that city.  

-18,930 AS -  
Plague of the White Hand ravages the "Known World" under the reign of Priestking Bashdis Mssa IV. Many regions  
depopulated and whole cities, such as Urmish, decimated, which are not to be resettled for nearly a century.  

-18,925 AS -  
Priestking Arkhuam Mssa dies of a horrible plague that is later named after him.  
-18,925 to 18,912 AS -  
A gap appears in the First Epoch where there are no ruling Priestkings. The cause is not known to contemporary scholars.  

-18,912 AS -  
Priestking Bashdis Mssa V restores government (?), and adds to the number of Sakbe-roads and fortresses.  

-18,858 AS -  
Priestking Nemandu II, already an old man, rules for 36 years living only on bread and Hmelu-milk. He was isolated by his advisors from the outside world.  

-18,784 AS -  
The Temple of Sarku in Jakalla is sold to an enterprising merchant who had it tore down so that he might trade the stone for Chlen-hides and a shipment of wine. Priestking Nemandu III, who sold the temple, promptly disappears from his court (nothing is mentioned of the fate of the merchant).  

-18,784 AS -  
Priestking Dharumesh Mssa III reforms the currency and develops the use of "writs" that could be cashed in distant cities (even in the markets of other nations).  

-18,746 AS -  
Priestking Bashdis Mssa is "crushed by a demon."  

-18,746 AS -  
Priestking Dharumesh Mssa IV, "The Singer of Gentle Songs." This Priestking will develop "picture books" using OtherPlanar sorcery to animate the pictures in the books. He will also marry a Saa Allaqiyani woman, Misa Tanio, who will be Queen.  

-18,736 AS -  
Priestking Ssirandar VII, "He Who Lived too Long," seizes power after Dharumesh "passes away" (?). This ruler executes Priestqueen Misa Tanio as a "traitoress."  

-18, 692 to -18,667 AS -  
Revolution, civil war, and the destruction of temples during the reign of Priestking Bashdis Mssa VII. This Priestking falls to Arkhuan Milende, "He Who Hates the Gods." The Legion of the Seekers of Indelible Victory is sent east, through Mihallu, into the barren Plains of Glass, where it disappears.  

-18,667 to -18,664 AS -  
A gap in Engsvanyali records appears here. It is assumed that civil war still rocks the "Empire of the Gods" while Arkhuan Milende rages across the lands.  

-18,664 AS -  
Priestking Nemandu IV, a general from another lineage, restores the Empire. He ousts "greedy priests" and favors the army in all things.  

-18,602 AS -  
Priestking Kakkonen Chre, a usurper from Jakalla, seizes Ganga with a fleet of pirate ships.  

-18,590 AS -  
Ssirandar VIII, cousin of the murdered Priestking Bashdis Mssa VII, returns from a "voyage around the world" to retake Ganga and slay the usurper.

-18,573 to -18,531 AS -  
Priestking Bashdis Mssa VIII, "The Builder of Tombs" and "Restorer of Catacombs," pours much of the Empire's treasury into massive tomb building projects. The Necropolises built by this Priestking are never to be exceeded in opulence and grandeur in the history of the world.  

-18,531 AS -  
Priestking Dharumesh Mssa VI devises the "Twenty-Four Forms" of formal dress worn at affairs of state (still to be used, more or less changed, during the Tsolyanu Imperium era).  

-18,399 AS -  
Tettukanu Dlee I, "The Slaughterer of Children," seizes power, isolating the current Priestking in Bey Su by seiging the city with soldiers. The rebel kills Bashdis Mssa IX in battle on the walls of Bey Su on -18,384 AS. Most of the emperor's family are executed after Bey Su falls (their heads hacked off by the rebel himself or thrown from the palace towers).  

-18,394 AS -  
Bashdis Mssa X, the twelve year-old child of Bashdis Mssa IX, disappears from Bey Su after its fall to Tettukanu Dlee I. Scholars think that the child was abducted by priests of the One Other (perhaps to use him against Tettukanu Dlee I).

[Civil war and the end of the First Epoch]

-18,394 to -15,894 AS  
This time period is refereed to as the Second Epoch. This era is marked by many semi-autonomous states that are called "Engsvanyali," by historians. Following the disappearance of Bashdis Mssa X, the clergy of several temples warred against the temples of the Pariah Gods, and then rose up against Ganga itself (it is lost to history as to which temples turned against the Empire - this historian feels that most of the antagonists were those of the temples of Change). This religious war added to the ongoing secular civil war. The Vriddi declared Fasiltum independent; Teshengtu Tlekolmu "the Hammer of the West" did likewise in Tumissa; the northern regions of what is now Yan Kor slipped away; Salarvya, Mihallu, and the east also left the Empire. On another note, the Tsolei Archipelago and the southern regions of cold, northern Nluss was conquered by one of the fragmented Engsvanyali Empire. Despite the political chaos of the Second Epoch, much was accomplished in the arts, military  
knowledge, and the sciences. The emergence of local dialects of the Engsvanyali language is noted. The "Hero of the Age" drives out the servants of the Pariah Deities into the Outer Darkness. The Priestking Hemanche Farkhenu solidifies the much shrunken Engsvanyali Empire.

  
-15,873 AS -  
Girandu I, son of Hemanche Farkhenu, ushers in the Third Epoch. This Priestking conquers the splinter dynasties. The Hlutrgu are driven back into the jungles of Layodu and the Shikel Swamps. The Priestking rewards each soldier of the Legion of the Joyful Clan of the Noble Vrayani with slingstones of rubies and diamonds.  

-14,871 AS -  
The ancient priestly Council is summoned into session after the last Girandu passes without issue or relative for the throne. The Rebellion of the Right Hand ensues between the candidates for the throne of the Empire. Chayetlesa Tlalesu, a priestess of Ksarul, remains as the lone survivor of the rebellion. She is declared the Priestqueen, and "The Long Peace" is ushered in.  

-14,866 to -14,844 AS -  
Priestking Menkoru I reconquers Salarvya and Saa Allaqi; establishes trade with the Naqsai of the Southern Continent; and sends emissaries into Mihallu and the eastern regions of Salarvya.

-14,844 AS -  
Ascension of Priestking Girandu XV. This Priestking will write a treatise on economics and develop the workings of business throughout the Empire.  

-14,775 AS -  
Ascension of Priestking Menkoru II. Building of the Great Hall of the Priestkings on Ganga Isle. The court of Menkoru II is said to be the most opulent in history.  

-14,739 AS -  
Ascension of Priestking Menkoru III. The practice of using sorcery to prolong the life of an emperor is declared illegal following the efforts of this emperor to extend his life. More Sakbe-roads are built, and the mighty fortress of Ngala near modern Jakalla is strengthened. Ports and harbors are built around the (now extinct) Sea of Milumanaya. Thousands of monuments and stela are placed along the borders of the Empire.  

-14,442 AS -  
Ascension of Priestking Atkolum I. The Empire wars against the Shen but eventually make peace. The Temple of the Goddess of the Pale Bone is destroyed near what is now Pelesar. The shrines of the Gods on Ganga is restored to "proper grandeur."  

-14,433 AS -  
Ascension of Priestking Menkoru IV. The formal etiquette of the imperial court reaches new heights of complexity. New titles, pageantry, and innovations in costume and manners are developed.  
[5 years pass between the reigns of Menkoru IV and Chayetlesa II. The reason for this gap is not known.]  

-14,387 AS -  
Ascension of Priestqueen Chayetlesa II.  

-14,363 AS -  
Ascension of Priestking Atlkolum II. A corps of secret police and a system of informants are developed. The Tolek Kana Pits are refurbished.  

-14,243 AS -  
Ascension of Priestking Girandu XVI.  

-14,207 AS -  
Ascension of Priestqueen Chayetlesa IV. Schools and academies are established within the temples. Orphanages are built and women's causes are advanced. Hospitals and facilities for the mentally ill are developed by the Chief Minister (a priest of Ketengku).  

-14,197 AS -  
Ascension of Priestqueen Alineya I.  

-14,187 to 13,937 AS -

The Yan Koryani general, the Lady Deq Dimani (one of Yan Kor’s best generals and a lover of the Baron), feels that the fortresses in southern Milumanaya can slow a Tsolyani advance in time to gather more reinforcements.

Battle of the town of Anohl with the defeat of the Tsolyani army. General Karin Missum razes the city of Grai and Kru Sekka to bring Saa Allaqi to its knees (this causes the Ssao to break negotiations of peace with Avanthar and to recall his daughter, Princess Vrisa Vishetru, by sending her brother Mridan Vishetru to reclaim her). Kambe accepts command of the field forces when Karin Missum is recalled to Avanthar to deal with problems growing in the west. Kerdu Kutume of the Legion of the Storm of Fire pacifies the rear areas of Milumaniya.

**2365 A.S.** - Mu'ugalavyani invaded the forest state of Do Chaka, using an army of the Ssu, loathsome monsters who detest all mankind, as their icebreakers to shatter the army of Prince Eselne and sack the city of Tumissa in Tsolyanu. The plan, led by a general named Tewfik, failed when a group of Tsolyani agents (adventurers) stole the Eye of Commanding Enemies, a magic item which kept the Ssu hypnotised. When the Ssu awoke from their trance, they turned on the Mu'ugalavyani, rending the army to the four winds.

2366 AS (autumn) -  
Prince Rereshqala quells food riots in Jakalla and then calls for a new _Kolumejalim_, though still claiming reluctance to take the Petal Throne. Ma’in joins Rereshqala in his estate in Jakalla. Mirusiya remains within the walls of Fasiltum with his love Elara hiVriddi while undead besiege the rebellious desert city (though the Prince did sneak into Bey Su to consult with Taksuru and then return unharmed). Eselne leads an army toward Bey Su, bringing Hauma and Purdimal under hand. “Wild” Pe Choi tribes throw off the yoke of Mu’ugalavyani and Tsolyani rule. Baron Ald returns to Yan Kor to put down revolts. Pijena and Saa Allaqi abandon their alliance with Yan Kor. The False Plague ravages Livyanu. Ssu expeditions sighted in Chaigari.

2366 AS (winter) -  
Eselne commands the western borders of the Empire. Taksuru reigns in Bey Su. Rereshqala crushes the remnants of an invading force of Sarku soldiers who terrorized Jakalla and caused many citizens to flee. Mirusiya remains defiantly ensconced within Fasiltum but discovers that Elara hiVriddi was an illusion. The Livyani abandon many of their cities ravaged by the False Plague. Mmatugual Shen begin incursions into Livyani as they flee from Shenyu advances. Mu’ugalavyani raid south into Livyanu. Salarvyani soldiers command the Gilraya Forests. Fenul becomes Tsolyani again, but the Governor only rules because the Salarvyani can’t be bothered to retake the city. Wild Pe Choi drive off Mu’ugalavyani and crush the Tsolyani Ito clan (who were still recovering from Mu’ugalavyani brutality). The Pachi Lei are ethnically cleansed from Pan Chaka by Mu’ugalavyani garrisons. Those that have not been exterminated or fled remain in the deep forests, starving to death.  

2367 AS -  
Eselne leaves Paya Gupa at the head of his army and takes Mrelu and Purdimal, but is halted at Usenanu by forces loyal to Rereshqala. Mirusiya invades Avanthar through secret tunnels, but is repulsed by undead and monsters of the Underworlds and is forced to group near Thri'il. Taksuru rules Bey Su and holds up to 100 tsan west (near Usenanu) and over to Fasiltum. The Red Clans holds Tumissa as an independent kingdom and its warriors fight off Mu’ugalavyani incursions.

Current history "ends" with the civil war still raging (or perhaps simmering is a better word) in Tsolyanu, the Red Hats still holding Pan Chaka and Livyanu, and Salarvyani forces both raiding the Empire's eastern provinces and bickering amongst themselves. Additional details will be incorporated as more information comes in. My contacts in Tsolyanu (namely Tilekka hiVaishya of Jakalla and a few other adventurous "scholars") are rather busy at the moment, and I do not wish to take too much of their time.
