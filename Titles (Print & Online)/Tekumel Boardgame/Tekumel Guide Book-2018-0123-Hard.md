# **The Turn Sequence**

Tekúmel: EPT is played over a series of turns. A player must complete his entire turn, after which the player to his left completes his entire turn, etc. In this way, play continues clockwise around the table until the game ends. Each player turn is divided into these five steps:

Step 1: Refresh Cards

Step 2: Movement

Step 3: Encounters

Step 4: City Market

Step 5: Missions

A player must follow these steps in order, although he may not be able to complete every step.

**Step 1: Refresh**

During this step, refill your Hero Action cards to three (3). You may discard any amount of Hero Action cards, before refilling your hand. Refill spells as noted on any cards.

You turn over all your activated cards, so they are now face up. These cards may now be activated again. See page 9 for further details on activating cards. If you have no activated cards, you skip this part.

**Step 2: Movement**

During this step you may move your Hero figure on the board. Your figure represents your Hero and all his Companions. You may use one Hero Action card to alter your normal movement.

**Step 3: Encounters**

If you end your movement in a space occupied by another player’s Hero, you must decide whether you want to interact with the other Hero or the Region space or City space.

When you end your movement in City space, the player to the left of the current player draws one Encounter card; if it is not a human encounter then it is discarded to the bottom of the Encounter deck. (See Encounter Cards for an explanation of resolving the encounter).

When you end your movement in Region space, you must roll on the Region’s Adventure table or draw Encounter cards as indicated in the Region’s space.

**Step 4: City Market**

A player may only take the City Market step if his Hero ends his movement in a city space otherwise, the player must skip the City Market step.

City Market Actions:  
Before taking any actions during the City Market step, the player draws 1 card from the Equipment deck. The Hero in a city may make a Trade roll (page 14) to increase the number of Equipment cards to be drawn (Easy = 1 card/ Ave = 2 cards/ Hard = 3 cards) and place them, face up on the table.  
Once you have Equipment cards in view, you may take any number of the following actions in any order, as many times as you want and can afford:

•Buy Equipment: If available, choose an Equipment card from the City Market stack and pay its cost to the bank.  
•Buy Torch(es): Choose a Torch card(s) from the City Market and pay its cost (1 Káitar each) to the bank.  
•Buy a Slave: Choose a Slave card from the City Market and pay its cost (3 Káitars) to the bank.  
•Sell Equipment: Add one of your Equipment cards to the Equipment card discard pile and take half its cost (rounded down) from the bank.  
•Buy Healing: For one gold Káitar, you can heal one wound from your Hero by your Temple.

**Step 5: Missions**

During this step, if you are ready to complete your Mission, then you may read your Mission card to show that you have completed its requirements. Before earning your Lán, other players may play Hero Action Cards in turn, clockwise around the table. Only the last card played takes effect. All other cards are discarded. If the card played has a negative effect to the current player, then the player who played the last Hero Action Card encumbers Bussán and loses one Lán.

Lán Points  
Upon completion of his Clan’s Mission the player earns the Lán points printed on the Mission Card. The player receives a +1 Lán, if the Mission card mentions the same religion as the player. The current player draws two (2) Mission Cards and selects one to perform. The other Mission Card is discarded.

At the end of the Mission phase the player may increase one attribute by spending one Lán from his current pool. You cannot increase any one attribute by more than three from your original starting value!

**End of Turn**

Your turn is now over. The player to your left now takes his turn, beginning with the Refresh step.
