Tutorial for Word-based mapping

I decided to use Word since it’s fairly easy to use and has much greater exposure than Campaign Cartographer or Dunjini, two of the more popular fantasy mapping software packages.

First we start by making the basic hex. Select the “Autoshapes”🡪”Basic Shapes” tool and select the hex shape. Then while holding down the shift key (will make the shape regular, not squashed), draw a hex using the left mouse button. Make the hex fairly big. The hex will be oriented the wrong way compared to the Northwest Gazetteer (NWG) maps, but that’s the only format of hex available in Word. We’ll fix it next.

Then select the shape with the right mouse button and select “Format Autoshape” Select the “Size” tab, and set the Height to 7”. Make sure the “Lock Aspect Ratio” button is checked. Then put 90 into the Rotation field. The select the “Colors and Lines” tab and click on the triangle next to the “Colors” field, then select “No Color” – we want a hex with no background for now. Then click OK. You’ll have a big 7”-wide hex. We’ll resize it back down to 5” soon.

The NWG maps are 14 subhexes across, so that’s why I used 7” as the width. We’ll make each subhex 0.5” in width. Easiest way to do this is to select the big hex and copy and paste it. Then resize the pasted hex, make it 0.5 inches in height. NOTE: the he keeps it’s default orientation, so the height of the hex as drawn becomes the width of it when rotated 90.

The next part is the hardest to do and to explain. We have to fill the big hex with many copies of the smaller, making sure that they’re all aligned and distributed.

Paste three small hexes and move them around so that they are touch left-to-right and mostly aligned a the top. He holding the shift-key, select all three of the hexes. Then in the “Draw” menu select the “Align and Distribute” item, then click on “Align Top”. Then while all 3 hexes are still selected, click on the edge of one of them and select “Grouping’ 🡪 “Group”.

Then slide the small hexes so they are inside the big hex. Select both big hex and small hex triplet, and align their centers “Draw” 🡪 “Align and Distribute” 🡪 “Align Center”. Then select only the hex triplet and while hold down the shift key, slide the triplet up so it’s NW & NE edges line up with the big hex’s NW & NE edges. There will be a chevron shaped area a the top, we’ll add a vertical line there to split that into two half hexes. Select “Autoshapes” 🡪 “Lines” and while holding the shift key, draw a line from the apex of the big hex to the center apex of the hex triplet. I’ll call this little line an APEX LINE. You can use “Draw” 🡪 “Align & Distribute” 🡪 “Align Center” to get them to line up perfectly.

Now it’s just a matter of doing those steps over and over until you have the entire big hex tiled with small hexes. Once you’re done, select the big hex, every small hex row and every Apex Line and group them into a single entity.

Draw another big hex, making it 7” in height, rotate it, but also on the “Colors and Lines” tab, make the line width 7.5pt, this will be the thick border of the big hex. Select it and the filled hex, and align them Left and Top. If you want to, group the two together and center it on the page. On the “Format Autoshape” menu, select the “Layout” tab, and the options there to position the object somewhere on he page. A good place would be to position it center horizontally and vertically on the page.

You now have your blank canvas for making a 7” wide hex map. If you want the NWG size hexes, select both big hexes (the filled one and the thick border one), select “Format Autoshape” 🡪 “Size” and resize them so they’re 5”x5.78” inches. If you have “Lock Aspect Ratio” selected, you only need to give it the 5” size.

For 5” hexes, two will fit on a page in landscape format, so copy, paste and align.

Now comes the fun part. You will learn to love the Zoom menu iem, plus the “Order”🡪“Send to Back” and “Order” 🡪 “Send to Front” options.

Using various autoshapes, (freehand lines, curves, straight lines, polygons, etc) draw your map. For Sakbe roads I used a 5pt triple line. Draw a triple line from one hex side to the other. Click on the line and select “Edit Points”, little black squares will appear at each end. Use and slide those squares around to change the slope of the line. You can right click anywhere on the line and “Add Point”, to get another black square. You can then slide that square around to make a road with an angle in it. Repeat as desired.

For rivers use the squiggly freehand line and when done change the color to your favorite blue. I make the river widths either 1pt, 3pt, or 5pt depending on whether I want a stream, fordable river, or major river.

In the “Autoshaped”🡪”Lines” menu, I use the closed polygon to draw areas to be filled. Select it and click at various points to make a straightedge, or hold down the mouse button to draw a freehand edge.

Once you draw a shape, you should change it’s line (the border) to “No color” and then fill it with your favorite color. I’ve been browsing the web for public domain textures to use as fill patterns, but you could just use the colors and patterns that come with Word, i.e. a light green for woods, darker green for forest, really dark green for jungle, etc.

Once you draw a filled area, you’ll notice that it obscures the hex grid. Select the shape, select “Order”🡪”Send to Back” so it’s behind the grid. He very last thing I do is select the thick border big he and do a “Move to Front” on it, so it covers up and imperfections of shape or lines along the hex border.

For habitated areas, I used “Autoshapes”🡪”Basic Shapes” and selected circles and stars. Using various line widths and fills and resizing them, you can get a whole gamut of things.

Add text using the “Insert”🡪“Text Box” menu. I make the text boxes without edge lines (set to “No Color”) and with a white fill but with the “Transparent” field checks. Make sure the text is on top of everything.

I usually decouple the hex grid and the original big hex, so I can give the original big hex a grassland texture. It’s the very back layer, then the hex grid, then woods, then forests, then hills, then trails, then sakbe roads, then cities, towns and villages.
