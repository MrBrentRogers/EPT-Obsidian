These messages are the accumulation of the messages that were sent out on 
the Blue Room email list between May 1995 and June 2000.  A large portion 
of the information is directly from Professor M.A.R Barker. When the list 
members joined during the time the list was active, they agreed to refrain 
from sharing this data with non list members.  When the list ended, it was 
urged that the data be made available to non-list Tekumel fans, and it 
seemed like a good idea all around.

I only ask that if you download these digests, or have received them in 
some other way, please respect the agreements the list members made, and 
refrain from passing them around and instead point people to the Tekumel 
web site, www.tekumel.com so that they can download them for themselves, 
and see all the other material available on the Tekumel.com web site.

Many Thanks.

[Moderator's Note:  Steve Lopez provides this first hand account of the      ]
[                   discover of a group of Mrur from the First Imperium.     ]
[                   I sent a copy to the Professor when I received this, and ]
[                   have included his comments at the end.  Nice work Steve! ]

As promised, here is a first-person account of the discovery 
of a group of mrur that were created during the First 
Imperium. The names of the characters have been changed to 
prevent reprisals by any Nighted Tower clan members who may 
read this. My commentary is found in brackets ({}).

{Background: Four clan brothers from Bey Su are spending a 
few days in a small Kerunan village, located at the edge of 
the Gilraya Forest not far from the Salarvya border. One of 
the young men, Omel, steals off into the forest with a local 
girl, Vishaya, for an afternoon's "fun". Quite accidently, 
they discover a pit with a tunnel leading from its bottom. 
They return to the village to round up Omel's companions, as 
well as a lad named Tsodlan (who fancies himself an expert 
swordsman).

The strangers are making no friends in town. Both Vishaya's 
father (who happens to be the village headman and the local 
Sarku priest) and Tsodlan (who had, until today, been 
Vishaya's exclusive lover) are unhappy about Omel's 
attentions to Vishaya. Pi'ur (the narrator of the following 
piece) has a somewhat rude, sarcastic manner that is 
offensive to many.

Meanwhile, Vishaya is playing all ends against the middle. 
She has several ways to come out on top: go off with Omel 
when he returns to Bey Su, betray Omel and his companions 
should their expedition turn up anything of interest to the 
Empire, stay on Tsodlan's good side (he could be useful for 
killing the strangers should the need arise, plus the boy's 
restless nature won't allow him to stay in Kerunan forever), 
betray her own father to take over the Sarku temple's 
leadership, and so on. Her duplicity will spell trouble for 
someone; exactly who that someone will be depends on what 
lies at the end of the underground tunnel...

Our characters are:

Pi'ur -- scribe, sometime warrior, and our narrator;
Omel -- jack-priest of Ketengku, who has an eye for the 
ladies;
Kagesh -- bodyguard and clan-brother of Pi'ur and Omel;
Sanjesh -- a huge brute of a man, a mighty warrior who is 
much smarter than he looks;
Kerrune -- torchbearer, slave of Omel;
Tsodlan -- village boy, whose ambition is to be the greatest 
swordsman in the Five Empires;
Vishaya -- priestess of Sarku, and trouble personified

I've omitted the beginning of Pi'ur's account, which opens 
with a devotion to Lord Ketengku and a brief description of 
the events leading up to the party's arrival at the top of 
the pit.}

*****

All of us were silent as we looked over the edge of the pit 
and stared at the bottom some distance below.

Finally, Omel asked the inevitable question. "Who wants to 
be first?" He smiled as he looked from face to face.

"I'm not afraid!" Tsodlan cried. "I'll go!"

"And probably get us all killed," I muttered. The boy glared 
at me.

Omel laughed. "Well, _someone_ has to be first!"

"Why not you?" Vishaya replied, with a twinkle in her eye. 
"You should have the honor; after all, you discovered the 
pit." Omel gave no reply.

I spat in disgust and nudged Tsodlan. "Come on; we'll go." I 
turned to Omel. "Send the slave down next with a lighted 
torch. Once he's down, I don't care who follows."

Kagesh and Sanjesh lowered the two of us to the pit's 
bottom. The slave was lowered a moment later.

"What do you see?" Omel called down once the torch was lit.

"A hideous face!" I cried.

"A face?"

"Yes -- it's leaning over the top of the pit!"

Omel swore. "By the Gods, Pi'ur! If we weren't clan 
brothers..."

The last thing I heard as I entered the tunnel was Omel 
muttering, "It's small wonder no one likes him..."

*****

The tunnel was cool and dry. The lack of moisture was 
evidently due to the fact that it initially sloped upward, 
so any rainwater in the pit remained there. The passage's 
width varied, but it was usually a little over two dhaiba 
across. We could easily walk two abreast within it. The 
floor and walls were made of packed earth.

"It would be terrible if the ground suddenly shifted and 
this tunnel collapsed," Sanjesh remarked. There followed a 
low moan from directly behind me; the slave Kerrune was none 
too excited about accompanying us on our expedition, and 
Sanjesh's comment had done nothing to reassure him.

Vishaya spoke up. "This tunnel won't collapse. It's been 
here awhile," she said. "It's not man-made. It was probably 
created by some animal. See -- the surfaces are very 
irregular."

"Excellent!" I replied. "I'm about to realize my life's 
ambition: dinner for a dnelu!"

I heard Tsodlan laugh beside me. "You city folk", he 
said, shaking his head. "If there was a dnelu here, he'd 
have grabbed up your friend when he discovered the pit..." 
His voice trailed off. I saw him glance over his shoulder to 
look at Vishaya and Omel walking side-by-side behind the 
torchbearer. The look on his face would have chilled the 
blood of the fiercest Shen. Omel failed to notice.

Kagesh cleared his throat. "Perhaps it would be best for us 
to remain silent -- in case something besides dnelu dwell 
here."

His point was well-taken. We crept along silently, following 
the twists and turns of the tunnel, until it abruptly ended 
at a stone wall. In the wall's center was a gaping crack, 
big enough for a man to pass through.

I turned to look at my companions. Kagesh was shaking his 
head. "What--" he muttered.

"Now _that's_ man-made!" whispered Omel.

"Some animal evidently built the tunnel for its den," I 
said. "It continued to dig until it reached this wall, quite 
by accident. My guess is that it's now living on the other 
side of that fissure." I turned to Tsodlan. "Well, lad, are 
you ready for some adventure?"

He scowled. "'Lad'? Why, you're not much older than me!"

"Not much wiser, either," I replied, "else I'd still be safe 
in our clanhouse back in Bey Su." I reached behind me and 
tapped Kerrune. "Bring that torch up closer to the crack; 
I'm going in."

With that, I drew my short sword and gingerly climbed up 
into the aperture. I looked down and saw that the floor was 
only a half-dhaiba below. I dropped down on the other side 
of the crack. I turned and hissed "Kerrune, you worthless 
scum, get in here with that torch!" After a moment, the 
slave was standing at my side.

I found that I was standing in a man-made hallway, around 
two dhaiba wide and about the same height. The walls, 
ceiling, and floor were made of massive stone blocks, fitted 
together so tightly that a sheet of the finest parchment 
couldn't be slid between them. There was lettering along the 
top of the walls, ugly, block-like lettering that reminded 
me of a Yan Koryani document I'd once seen. There were 
vertical niches in the walls, starting about a half-dhaiba 
from the floor, but I wasn't close enough to them to see 
what they contained. The spot where I stood was at a 
three-way intersection. The corridor stretched ahead of me 
and to either side, disappearing into inky blackness.

I motioned for the others to join me. As Omel stepped down 
into the corridor, I pulled him aside. "Beware the boy!" I 
hissed in his ear. "He yearns to spill your blood!"

"What?" he whispered back. "Why would--"

I cut him off. "The girl! He has eyes for the girl!" Omel's 
mouth dropped open and he nodded in comprehension. "I'll 
keep him up front with me," I said reassuringly.

At that moment, I heard Vishaya call from a few dhaiba 
farther down the corridor. "Ohe, look at this!" I moved 
toward her, then saw what had surprised her. Many of the 
wall niches were empty, but the one before Vishaya contained 
human remains!

The person in the niche before her was little more than a 
skeleton. Long strands of hair drooped from a few bits of 
scalp that still clung to the skull. The corpse's 
fingernails had grown to prodigious lengths, giving its 
hands the appearance of talons. A few shreads of tattered 
clothing still hung in places from the body. Its chin rested 
on its chest and its arms hung akimbo at its sides.

We could see a few more such corpses in some of the other 
wall niches. Sanjesh looked puzzled. "A burial chamber? 
Here? By the Gods, we're out in the middle of nowhere!"

"Look at the walls," Omel replied. "This place wasn't built 
anytime in the recent past. No one uses huge blocks like 
these anymore."

Vishaya spoke up. "It's not of recent construction, that's 
true enough. I few summers ago, I helped some men from 
Sokatis who were in Kerunan looking for ancient ruins. They 
taught me a little about old writings. That lettering along 
the top of the wall -- it's of Bednalljan origin."

"First Imperium?!" I cried. "That's impossible! These 
corpses would have turned to dust long since!"

Omel and Vishaya turned to face each other, their thoughts 
as one. "Sorcery!" they said in unison. Omel wheeled toward 
the rest of us, his arms outstretched. "No one touch any of 
these bodies!" he cried.

But it was too late. Tsodlan has spotted a sword hilt 
half-hidden behind one of the bodies. The grasped the hilt 
and pulled forth -- a hilt. There was no blade attached to 
the handle, merely a short blackened stump from which a few 
fragments flaked off and fell to the floor. But in pulling 
it forth, his arm had brushed against the corpse. It was the 
merest touch, but it was enough.

Suddenly, Vishaya cried out in surprise. We turned again to 
look. She was backing quickly away from the wall. Up in the 
niche, we saw the corpse's head slowly lift from its chest. 
An eerie light blazed from somewhere deep within its 
cavernous eye sockets. With an audible grinding, the mrur 
stepped down from the niche and advanced slowly toward us. 
As I looked about, I saw the same horrible scene being 
repeated in niches all along the catacomb.

Instantly, Kagesh and Sanjesh had drawn their longswords. 
The boy Tsodlan had his sword out as well, and sprang 
forward with a whooping battle-cry. I motioned for Kagesh 
and Sanjesh to join me in forming a semi-circle to protect 
Omel, the girl, and the slave, all of whom were unarmed. I 
shot a glance over my shoulder to Omel. "Don't let that 
maggot run off with the torch!"

The mrur slowly advanced. Tsodlan was well ahead of us, 
leaping at the foremost of the undead. His sword sliced an 
arc through the air, landing with full impact against the 
side of the fiend's head. With a loud crunching sound, the 
top of the creature's head shattered. The monster was 
unarmed, but it nevertheless swung viciously with a taloned 
hand. Tsodlan dodged the blow and swung backhanded at the 
mrur's midsection. With a sickening popping sound, the 
undead creature fell to pieces at the boy's feet.

"La! This is easy!" he called. Just then, a mrur approached 
from his blind side and struck a cruel blow at Tsodlan's 
shield arm. The claw struck home and blood began to flow 
from the boy's upper arm. Even after the creature's 
follow-through, one of its fingertips remained stuck in 
Tsodlan's arm.

"Get back here, boy!" Kagesh called out. "Form up with us, 
or they'll get in behind you!"

The boy retreated and took a place beside me. I stole a 
backward glance. Omel stood with Vishaya behind him, both of 
them blocking the opening in the wall so that our 
torchbearer couldn't escape and take our illumination with 
him.

"But you're a Sarku priestess!" I overheard Omel saying. 
"Surely there must be _something_ you can do!"

I laughed ruefully upon hearing this. An instant later, the 
ponderous assault of the mrur finally reached us.

To my surprise, Tsodlan was correct: it _was_ easy. Our 
undead foes were unarmed and unarmored. All that was 
required was a single well-placed swordstroke to make one of 
the animated corpses collapse into a pile of bones at our 
feet.

It took just a few yom for the battle to be won. The only 
wound suffered was the one to Tsodlan's shield arm. Omel 
offered to cast a healing spell on the boy.

Tsodlan sneered at Omel. "Not you -- her!" he spat, pointing 
at Vishaya.

I walked over to him and examined his wound. "A healing 
spell isn't required; it's not that serious." I removed the 
mrur's finger joint from his arm and bound his wound with a 
strip of cloth. "That will stop the bleeding," I announced.

"Which way now?" Kagesh pondered.

"Straight ahead," said Sanjesh, and we began to carefully 
make our way down the corridor.

*****

{There's much more to Pi'ur's tale, but this will do for 
now.

There are many unanswered questions here. How did the mrur 
survive all those centuries down in the catacombs? Why were 
they so easy to destroy? Why weren't they better armed? And 
the biggest question: what _is_ this place?

Actually, I know the answer to the last question, but that 
will wait for another time. I have a good idea as to why the 
mrur weren't better armed, but this, too, will wait.

The biggest questions for our discussion are the first two. 
I'm not sure why the mrur survived all those centuries, 
although I'm convinced that it was a very powerful sorcerer 
who animated them in the first place. Perhaps the tomb was 
tightly sealed, and the decomposition process didn't really 
begin in earnest until the wall was cracked.

As for why they were so easy to kill: it took an enormous 
amount of sorcerous power to animate the mrur for that 
extended period. However, even powerful magic wears off 
after time. The sorcery used to animate the mrur was

Dear Chris,

This is an excellent account. Most of it is very creditable and "Tekumel-
authentic." I hve really little to add. Do some more!

>The biggest questions for our discussion are the first two. 
>I'm not sure why the mrur survived all those centuries, 
>although I'm convinced that it was a very powerful sorcerer 
>who animated them in the first place. Perhaps the tomb was

>begin in earnest until the wall was cracked.

Sorcery of that power has to be very rare and rather unstale after all 
those centuries. The bodies would have decomposed, even in a sealed 
environment, and I can't think of any other means of preservation short 
of pickling!

>As for why they were so easy to kill: it took an enormous

You are correct here. The power of the ancient sorcerer must have been 
stupendous, but everything does have its limits.

>A last observation: the mrur didn't move until one was

Again, this is conjecture. You may be correct.

[                   a message I forwarded directly to the Professor.        ]

Good luck with your scenario and forthcoming game! Keep good records -- 
and think, possibly, of putting them onto the Blue Room or the FTP site 
at a later time. The Sarku worshippers of the Kraa Hills are now pretty 
average peasant stock, having lost much of any "non-Tsolyani" culture 
they might once have had. They are a lot more assimilated to Tsolyani 
life than the Ito clan of the Chakas, for instance. They now remember 
only a few words of what they say was once a complete language, and their 
rites are very similar to the urban Sarku worshippers in the City of 
Sarku. They tend to wear brown or ochre smocks and lace-up boots. The 
latter are probably a protection against the Alash snakes and Epeng 
that frequent the mountains of their area. They cut their hair in a sort 
of "Norman" fashion: long on top and shaved all around the sides -- no 
beards or moustaches. Other Tsolyani consider them "slow," but they are 
not stupid -- just canny, aloof, and secretive about their religious 
practices. Some say that there are temples to Lord Sarku back in the 
ravines and rocky valleys of the Kraa Hills that even the priesthood 
of Sarku does not know about.

Glad you find the descriptive passages in the Sourcebook useful. I

I could have a second lifetime to fill in all the blanks!

I'll try to help on specific questions, if they're not too many and too

The Heheganu and Hehecharu may well be mutated human stock, created 
during the Latter Times by some local warlord to serve as population 
in the misty swamps around old Purdimal. Some think they are indeed 
creations of the Temple of Ksarul, but for what reason? The Lord of 
the Blue Room is indeed the most powerful deity in Purdimal, as he is 
in Hmakuyal and a few other enclaves, but I don't see the need for his 
followers to modify a separate genetic group just so they can harvest 
Ssar-wood in the morasses around the city! Must have been some other 
reason.

Nuff for now.

[                   experience to handle the others.                         ]

Hi { especially to Bob Alberti :-) },

	I have a friend who is about to play a Priest of Wuru.  The 
sourcebook says of Wuru that- 
	" He is the active antagonist of Stability, and he aids those who
promote Change and overcome permanency. ... He aids those who combat the
minions of Stability ..." 

Has anyone of the Blue Room congregation played or met a Priest of Wuru?
What is a _fanatical_ worshiper of Wuru like?  How can they fulfill the 
goals of their god without always breaking the Concordat?  
 
[Moderator's Note:  Perfessor says, He who ventures out into the underworld, ]
[                   or other such lonely places, without some type of strong ]
[                   representation, often gets asked the question, "What     ]
[                   Concordat?"  Also, as much combat goes on in halls of    ]
[                   justice  and government, etc as goes on in the arena.    ]
[                   Fighting arms are not always the weapon of choice in a   ]
[                   combat.  Conflicts can be started in many ways.          ]

Also, how does the average temple-goer worship Wuru? Is it the case 
that the visible side of temple life, the ceremonies and rituals of 
appeasement are always there for the ordinary man. Only a few priests and 
agents actually go forth to live a life of overcoming stability?

Finally, how common if the worship of Hru'u and Wuru? We know of centres 
of worship for Vimuhla, Ksarul, Sarku and Dlamelish yet where are the 
followers of Hru'u?  What sort of %age of people worship him.  Is it the 
case that worshiping the Supreme Principle of Change is just too hard for 
most people as it is so difficult to know how to follow and please Him?

I've had Wuru worshippers in my game.  The fanatical ones were heavily
involved in Dark Trinity (the cooperation between the activist secret   
socities
of Hru'u, Sarku, and Ksarul) conspiracies to mess up the other temples,
especially the martial temples and Stability temples.

[Moderator's Note:  Professor Barker replies to Paul's Question about Wuru  ]
[                   Priests.                                                ]

On Wuru:

>Has anyone of the Blue Room congregation played or met a Priest of Wuru?
>What is a _fanatical_ worshiper of Wuru like?  How can they fulfill the 
>goals of their god without always breaking the Concordat?

The Concordat applies to _above-ground_ relationships. A priest of Wuru 
must thus be circumspect, courteous, and respectful -- as must all other
priests of the many deities.  A snide remark now and then is permitted, 
but nothing that  can be taken as cause for legal action or violence. 
Below ground, in the ancient labyrinths, "nobility" means defending one's 
temple, shrines, property, etc. in any way one can, and violence is 
winked at there -- though not always an automatic response. Just as in 
this world, violence is a "sometime" response to provocation or to obtain 
a goal; imagine a meeting of a Russian and an American in Paris at the 
height of the Cold War. There may be no cooperation and very little 
friendliness, but courtesy and proper behaviour are very important.

>Also, how does the average temple-goer worship Wuru? Is it the case 
>that the visible side of temple life, the ceremonies and rituals of 
>appeasement are always there for the ordinary man. Only a few priests and 
>agents actually go forth to live a life of overcoming stability?

This is true of all the temples. Only a select few may be chosen to 
perform the inner ceremonies and rituals, or to serve as defenders of 
the faith.  How many Catholic priests perform regular exorcisms?

>Finally, how common if the worship of Hru'u and Wuru? We know of centres 
>of worship for Vimuhla, Ksarul, Sarku and Dlamelish yet where are the

Worship of Wuru and Hru'u is commoner in some cities and regions than 
in others.  Around Purdimal, for example, many of the average people 
follow Lord Ksarul, yet there are villages, enclaves, and clans that 
traditionally belong to Wuru and/or Hru'u. This is just as true in Penom, 
in Jaikalor, etc. in varying degrees. Other deities are similarly 
represented. In a given clanhouse, too, a few families, lineages, and 
individuals may follow a deity who is not the "popular" deity of that 
group: e.g. a follower or two of Sarku, Hru'u, etc. may belong to the 
Tlakotani clan, to the Golden Sunburst, etc. His/her fellows may think 
the person weird or misguided, but in ecumenical Tsolyanu, mst folk will 
not raise overt objections -- of course, if a favourite son or daughter 
of a Hnalla-worshipper suddenly shows predilections for Lord Sarku or 
Lady Dlamelish, there may be some family arguments and even a little 
ear-boxing! But a determined convert is usually left to follow wherever 
his/her faitgh leads.

I can't give percentages easily since enclaves of devotees are so 
intermixed and confused. I'd estimate that Lord Hru'u's temple is 
indeed one of the smaller sects, in terms of population, but its 
members go back to very ancient roots. The same is true of Lord Wuru.

We have had several players over the years who have chosen to follow 
Wuru or Hru'u. At the moment, Lord Kotaru (I forget his lineage name) 
of the Sea Blue Clan is prominent in our group. I don't think he is on 
the Blue Room, however.

[Moderator's Note:  Bob Dushay comments on Nick's Sarku Speech.             ]

I really liked Nick's speech, but I felt it was lacking a bit of feel.
The soldiers would have been trained from birth that one does not question
the God-Emperor or an Imperial Prince: people are theirs to use as they 
like.  While there may be private dissatisfaction, I don't see a public
address as the proper audience to express these doubts.  I think the
address would be more along the lines of "glory to our leaders, and
the worm," and bravery in the face of adversity, etc.

[Moderator's Note:  David Bailey adds to the Wuru Priest topic.            ]

It may amuse you to hear that my longest surviving character is a Wuru 
priest, Midori Ito.

He stays alive by mixing huge quantities of opportunism with a dash of 
pragmatic restraint.

He is famous for deliberately paying vastly excessive prices for things 
in open cry markets, so as to destabilise the local economy.  He has a 
habit of giving 'grey hand' handshakes to people when they are in the 
underworld, at random, just to create confusion and chaos.  He never 
attacks anyone openly - it is far more productive to live off the fear 
and confusion created by his own presence in a room.  He has sent for 
demons in the daytime just to see if it could cause trouble for a 
certain Vimuhla priest. By associating with the wildest fringes of 
Chiteng, Hrihiyal and Ksarul, he catalyses events that lead to sudden 
and dramatic changes in peoples lives, in the local bureaucracy, and - 
he hopes - in larger events.

...but most of the time he pays his taxes (early, too much and with a 
smile), runs his farms and his palatial house on the river near Jakalla, 
manages his little shipping fleet (benignly and carefully), hunts with 
Jygg (a renyu) and wonders why his neighbours still spread rumours that 
he is homosexual when it only leads them into "bad dreams" and "accidents".

The Hmelu and the Hma fill the places of goats and sheep. Hmelu milk 
(and sometimes the much thicker and more oderiferous Hma's milk) fills 
the posaition of cow's milk on earth. The Kaika bird fills the ecological
niche of the chicken (turkey, etc.). There is no direct equivalent of the 
cow. Large amounts of meat are usually got from the Tsi'il, which cannot 
be completely domesticated. No pigs!

[Moderator's Note:  I commented to the Professor whether it is necessary to   ]
[                   have direct corollaries on Tekumel to Earth.  He responds.]
[                   I didn't mean this to invalidate your question, Paul, but ]
[                   I just wanted to make sure I was clear on the subject.    ]

Why SHOULD there be exact equivalents of every earth creature on Tekumel. 
Look at ancient Mesoamerica and South America: no cows, pigs, goats, sheep, 
chickens, etc. Deer and turkey were what the Aztecs and the Maya had. No cow, 
no milk. So the usual European patterns were missing there, too. 

Question 2:
 
[Moderator's Note:  New list member John Nowicki asks the following...        ]

>at the end of "Flamesong")

The Urunen are interesting. They are so far from "north Tekumel" that 
they had little idea of the great human empires there. They are reachable 
only via tubeway car, and this is perilous at best. Their society is quite 
different from those of north Tekumel. They do not worship the same 
pantheon found in the Engsvanyali-derived cultures of the Five Empires. 
They get along with some Hokun and are in perpetual combat with other 
Hokun states (there are several). There isn't much on them, outside of 
the Bestiary and the Sourcebook. A couple of high officials from Avanthar 
found their way down there via tubeway car after Dhich'une took over 
Avanthar. The Urunen were hospitable but puzzled. These exiles were so 
lonely and so lost away from their familiar surroundings that they finally 
left -- in spite of the obvious dangers of returning to Tsolyanu.


Question 3:

[Moderator's Note:  Paul Snow sent this question in on Vra.                  ]

The etymologies of Sine and Vra are not known -- lost in history. Probably 
even pre-Engsvanyali and even First Imperium.The division into two 
provinces was certainly Engsvanyali and was done for ease of adminis-
tration. Vra and Lnoris are clearly two separate ancient power centres. 
(I once heard a legend that there had been warfare between them at some 
unguessably early time in mythological history. I could never find any 
sources, however.) Now there is really little rivalry between these 
provinces; the rulers of Vra itself seem to have triumphed, economically, 
over the inhabitants of Lnoris. It's pretty much one country nowadays: 
rather like Kent and Surrey. Vra seems to be the richer of the two 
provinces, and its agricultural products are more widely famed than 
those of its sister-province. Nobody seems to mind very much. The real 
provincial governor resides in Vra, while the governor of Lnoris is 
much less important.

[Moderator's Note:  Paul Snow asks about Loyalties.                          ]

In reply to Paul Snow:

This is hard to quantify. Loyalty differs from individual to individual, 
of course, as it does in this world. One person may feel intense loyalty 
to his military unit (company, church, or other group), while the next 
person is not particularly loyal to that same group, even though their

some don't...) I'd put military unit loyalty generally BELOW family, 
lineage, and clan, but there might be soldiers to whom "the corps is my 
mother and my father."

Yes, it is very frequent. The ancient lineages often intermarried and 
mingled across clan lines. This is true of many but NOT all lineages: e.g. 
Ito, Tlakotani, and Vriddi are rarely found in other clans than their own. 
On the other hand, Qolyelmu, Chaishyani, and Tlelsu are rather more widely 
spread among the high clans. Vaisoner, Tirrune, and a few others are more 
often members of Ksarul- and Hru'u- centred clans than others, but they 
are almost always in "high" or "very high" clans. The minor lineages are 
similarly found mostly in less important clans.

>In particular, are there any lineages of the Joyous of Vra that are

Many of the old lineages have been represented on the island of Vra for 
millennia, and a number of these have members in the Joyous of Vra. 
Intermarriage is fairly common and not frowned upon, provided that the 
link is with an equal or higher clan. Hence, lineage names often overlap, 
and the Vrayani are an amiable, outgoing bunch, who don't mind such unions. 
In the City of Sarku, Hmakuyal, or even Khirgar, on the other hand, the 
locals are more aloof and jealous of their ancient connections.

Good luck, Nikun, with your academic strivings!

[Moderator's Note:  A question about the era of the Fisherman Kings.          ]

I would like to know if you have any idea how a citizen of the Empire of the
Fisherman Kings might have referred to that empire. The citizen in question was
originally from the area of what we now call Mechaneno, but I have seen that you
say that Salarvya and Pechano were Govenorships set up in Engsvanyali times.
Was the the previous empire dubbed  'Fisherman kings'  by the Priestkings? I
believe they would have spoken Bednalljan  -  would they have therefore been
'Bednalljani' themselves?  

Yes, during the Fisherman Kings' period, the northeast was divided into 
provinces, although these tended to be ephemeral, vague at the boundaries, 
and often semi-autonomous. The Bednalljans called their empire by a 
variety of names, too, depending on who was in power, which capital was 
currently running the local show, etc. As I recall, there was no one 
single name that endured for any length of time. Palikollan (accent on 
the -an) is one that did endure for a few hundred years, but it only 
referred to the centre of the Fisherman Kings' domain and the coast of 
western Salarvya.

As far as language is concerned, the Fisherman Kings spoke a group of 
dialects of ancient Salarvyani. These are related closely to Bednalljan 
Salarvyani, of course. Their scripts were different -- some are still 
not deciphered.

[                   working on the problem.  Just wanted you to know.        ]

>In Tsolyanu, people eat in clan dining rooms.  Who prepares the food?

In more wealthy clanhouses the food and chores are done by slaves or 
hired servants. Some of the more penurious of one's clan-brothers and 
sisters may also be paid by the clan to oversee these tasks -- and to 
perform them, if need be. Younger brothers and sisters also may be 
required to labour in clan enterprises or do houehold tasks as a matter 
of discipline and training. Those who are elderly or indigent are also 
supported by the clan in return for a few hours of work: supervision, 
watching over flocks, pruning the gardens, etc. Labour for one's clan is 
not considered "lowly," as it seems to have been among the aristocracy of 
19th Century Britain. Physical work is good for a child, the clan elders 
say, and responsibilities make good clansmen. Only in the very wealthy and 
anciently noble clans does one find slaves performing every task and 
serving every morsel of food, etc. Even so, these clans often put younger 
clans-brothers and sisters to work as discipline, training them in the 
crafts, arts, business, accountancy, sciences, etc. at the same time.

In poorer clans, and in the rural clanhouses of the great clans, too, 
there is a general tradition of hard work for all members. Herding a 
Chlen-beast is great therapy!

Cooks and other specialists may also be hired from outside, particularly 
when some elaborate production is desired. Fancy parties require the 
best food, entertainment, costumes, etc. that the clan can afford, and 
it is considered noble (and hence "good") to bring in these experts from 
outside: not only cooks and pastry-makers, but also vintners, perfumers, 
makers of fancy toiletries, mimes, singers, musicians, dancers, acrobats, 
athletes, gladiators, flower-arrangers, and a multitude of other trades 
and crafts are required -- and are lavishly laid on by the great clans. 
A Tsolyani feast in the Clan of the Golden Bough in Bey Su is a memorable 
event indeed!

	OK. I was just thinking that as Tekumel is an ecosystem that has been
ticking along quite nicely for ~100,000 years that there must be a balance
between wild animals, domesticated animals and man that ecologically 
works as an equilibrium.  In this system there must be slots filled by 
carnivores, omnivores, scavengers etc.  Are there any zoologists out 
there who can use these ideas to comment on the wildlife on Tekumel.  We 
know that Phil is happy to make technical comments part of official 
Tekumel if they fit in.  Given that there are no pigs on Tekumel but 
knowing that on earth pig farmers around towns used to feed the pigs food 
waste from the towns I guess that on Tekumel the food waste goes straight 
to the chlen pens.  The chlen are renowned for their smell for it seems 
to fit the slot.

	Another angle on this is to consider the effects of the animals that
we know exist.  The typical downland countryside of southern England (that we
want to preserve for its natural beauty!) is man made in that it is the result
of chopping down forests and grazing sheep on the hillsides.  Equally I seem
to remember that somewhere in the world (possibly SE Asia) there are two
adjacent countries that have different landscape because one doesn't keep
either pigs or goats. (Can anyone help ne out with this half remembered 
fact?)

	Anyway, I presume that on Tekumel wherever chlen graze the grass,
bushes and trees all get munched by these enormous creature.  So the open
plains or fields grazed by Chlen will reflect their eating habits.  I think
that this is shown in the illustration in the bestiary that depicts open
grasslands except for small clumps of large sturdy trees.  This is probably
more like savannah where elephants roam. 

	Taking this onward.  Bull elephants can be vicious when protecting a
herd or if they become "rogues".  How difficult to handle are chlen in the
rutting season?  There is a beast I wouldn't want to have an argument with. 
Are only female [cow?] chlen used for pulling carts as they are more docile?

On the Kolumel: the region around Avanthar is one of the most carefully 
protected, magically impenetrable places on Tekumel. This probably dates 
from the Latter Times but may have been enhanced by the Engsvanyali. As 
far as I know, it has only been penetrated by interplanar travellers a 
VERY few times in history, and then usually by mistake from planes that 
were not known or which were thought not to impinge on Avanthar. The 
ancient planetary defenses from before the Time of Darkness are also said 
to be still operative, sleeping in caverns on the mountaintop. I think 
they did fire a couple of times in my recollection.

As for somebody to talk to, the Emperor has access to the Hall of the 
Petal Throne, where he can speak to his subjects. A very few high officers 
of the Omnipotent Azure Legion also are allowed to speak to him from within 
specially designed private rooms, where he can see them but they cannot 
see him. The OAL also brings concubines and wives into the Golden Tower 
for his delectation; these are kept closely watched and segregated, but 
they may actually touch his sacred person, when he wishes.

All in all, it's not too bad a life...

I would urge the questioner to look up warship sizes, [personnel, etc. in 
the Sourcebook. I am sure that most of this is in there in some form or 
other. I don't have time to dig it all out myself. 

Most of questions 1, 2, and 3 is already in the Sourcebook. Question 4 
(about catapults) is also there, but it may be noted that both rams and 
catapults are common on Tsolyani, Salarvyani, and Mu'ugalavyani vessels. 
The Shen use rams but only occasionally have artillery on their ships.

Both: various ship-types have rams designed for various purposes. It is 
hard to say at any given time just how many of each ram-armed vessel 
there are.

Greek fire has not been developed, but bundles of burning wood, stones 
heated red hot, etc. are occasionally cast from artillery. The Hlaka are 
sometimes trained to drop firepots on enemy ships, but they hate travelling 
by ship and tend to head for the nearest land!


>7)	How effective is magic in naval combat.  Have any particular spells

Most large naval vessels are "magic-proofed" by special spells like those 
used to protect city and temple walls. Personal magic is not very effective 
at sea because of ranges and defensive spells put up by one's opponents.

>8)	Number and arrangement of masts and sails by different types of warship.

See the Sourcebook for common naval ship types.

Most Tsolyani and Mu'ugalavyani ships are clinker built; Salarvyani ships 
vary, as do those of such smaller nations as Haida Pakala. I don't have 
much information on the Yan Koryani ships of the northern sea. Livyanu and 
the Shen also prefer clinker built ships, but they are not as well designed. 
In the case of the Shen, the emphasis is on massive, and the hull is 
covered with thick black gum (like pitch) that becomes smooth and hard.

There is a lot more, but I lack the time right now to reply to all of it. 
I hope this much helps. If I get a few minutes later I will try to respond 
to your queries about organisation.

[                   how a game group meshes when from a divergent background, ]

The only Tekumel campaign I have had direct contact with is Patrick 
Brady's, in London, where he has made all of the player characters 
members of the same clan.  This allows characters of otherwise diverse 
backgrounds and religious beliefs to work together, as their clan loyalty 
overrides other issues.

I get the impression, though, that such is not the case with Professor 
Barker's campaign.  The characters I have heard about in that game sound 
extremely diverse in loyalties and affiliations.

As I am about to start a game, I welcome advice, anecdotes, warnings, 
etc. about how to (or how not to) put the party together.  I am not 
averse to having characters pursue divergent goals (I am an experienced 
Amber DRPG gamemaster, and divergent PCs are the rule in that 
environment), but I would like them to hang together enough to provide 
good roleplay opportunities.  My current intention is to bring the 
characters in at a fairly elevated level of society (probably the High 
clan range) because I enjoy political games.

[Moderator's Note:  I'll speak to this.  I think that this makes for a great ]

Roger initially wondered about a scenario where there were just a few 
Servitors of Silence between the Emperor and a visiting sorcerer.  Are the 
Servitors of Silence harmless?  I doubt it!

Given that there are such demons as Origob and the Beast Without A Tail, it 
seems that if there were not weapons or defences of incredible power, then 
Avanthar would long since have ceased to exist.

The defences cannot be perfect, to wit: Baron Ald and Mirusiya dropping in 
unexpectedly while Dhich'une was out; but must be pretty good.  On a piece 
of wild speculation, I wonder if the defences are 'tuned' to the current 
emperor by the same mechanisms that power the Jade Arch, or whether they 
depend on the emperor being in proximity to the Petal Throne.  Ummmm.

[Moderator's Note:  Remeber, the Jade Arch is said to be malfunctioning      ]
[                   these days, according to the Professor.                  ]

What I would really like to know, in my search for ever greater 
pyrotechnics with which to scare players <grin> is what the 'firing of 
planetary defences looks like?  Is it an expanding web of coruscating 
energy, as when the Weapon Without An Answer was fired in the North?

[Moderator's Note:  The Professor responds to Joe's question about party    ]
[                   dynamics.                                               ]

This question reminds me of the old ethnic joke that starts, "Once there 
were a Rabbi, a Catholic Priest, and a Protestant Reverend all stranded 
on a desert island ..."

The problem is with the way players see their characters and their 
reactions. If one takes the stance that all characters are "fanatics," 
quick to respond to the least offense with violence, then you will have 
a very short game indeed!

Most people, in this world as on Tekumel, are not really fanatics and 
can tolerate neighbours, colleagues, and even close friends who do not 
share their precise brand of politics, religion, etc. One just does not 
discuss controversial topics at polite dinner parties. The people of 
Tekumel do wear more garments and insignia to distinguish their faiths, 
clans,and allegiances than do most of us on Earth, and it is thus easier 
to see who is who. Rather like different army uniforms, not just a 
discreet little cross worn on a chain around the neck. Oh, people don't 
wear the heavy ritual priestly garb pictured in earlier works on Tekumel: 
the tall helmets, the plumes, the smiling silver masks, and the like. 
Just as Her Majesty doesn't always wear the great crown of state and 
carry the sceptre and the orb, and the Pope doesn'twalk around his 
private apartments in mitre and crosier, so do the folk of Tekumel attire 
themselves informally in kilt and sandals, perhaps a little vest or 
tunic, with perhaps a clans symbol at the throat or embroidered on the 
garment.

People tend to be "time servers," and not "fanatics." It is thus possible 
for laity and clergy of different faiths to cooperate together, socialise, 
and even intermarry. The only time one gets hostility is when there are 
real cross purposes and conflicting objectives. Sometimes one does meet 
cranks and fanatics and truly unpleasant people, of course, who cannot 
resist insults and gibes at those who belong to different faiths or 
persuasions. Such rude persons are rarely included inmutli-faith parties 
sent out to seek some objective that will benefit the various patrons.

There are fanatics, of course: the arrogant Vriddi, the aloof and 
secretive Ito or Domed Tomb people, for example. Even devotees of Lady 
Dilinala can be fanatics, unwilling to allow others the opportunity to 
speak or act in any un-Dilinala-like fashion.

Most of the expeditions on which players are sent are made up of people 
who are not fanatics -- or who are at least polite and clever enough 
not to let it show.  When it comes time to divide up the loot or seize 
the goal sought, however, some of these people may well show their true 
colours and exert themselves! Insults, gibes, and "humour" are kept to 
a minimum in Tekumelani society anyway, unlike many American groups I 
have known. It's too dangerous. When push comes to shove, however, there 
may be friction or even open hostility, but this is relatively rare 
since patrons generally know their people and their objectives, and do 
not send out an "ecumenical" party to acquire something that might be 
better suited for another patron organisation.

In my experience, thus, it is possible to have people of different 
faiths and political persuasions in the same group. It is BETTER if all 
are of related groups, clans, ineages, and the like, but a mixed group 
works if people are willing to MAKE it work -- and a patron who finds that
some member has created unnecessary problems is not likely to be pleased 
with that member.

Right now, the mission to the Valley of Kashkomai (northeast of Sokatis) 
contains Vimuhla, Wuru, and Ksarul people. There is one Karakan worshipper
and even a priest of Ketengku. A contingent of Dlamelish priests have just 
entered the valley to set up a shrine, and some of the bodyguard consists 
of Dilinala warrior women. There is also a Pe Choi major domo, and a band 
of Pechani mercenaries has hired on with the Wuru priests. Many of these 
factions will probably come to hostilities, if an objective of real 
importance is discovered.

In the past, we have experimented with parties of different complections. 
We have tried VERY diverse groups and also groups made up of a single 
clan from a single lineage in a single city who all share the same faith. 
(The latter is easier, of course.) The one thing we found that does NOT 
work is a discrepancy in social status: nobles and peasants, or free 
people and slaves. Tekumelani society is too class-conscious for players 
to take on roles that are too far apart on the social ladder. One can 
tolerate a priest or priestess of a hostile deity far more easily than a 
noble can bear to rub shoulders with a slave, artisan, or commoner. If a 
party of "lower-class" people is wanted, thus, we make sure that it 
consists of such persons only, and that contact with arrogant nobles and 
clergy is kept to a distant minimum.

Essentially, a good and viable group for "adventuring" should contain 
enough people of diverse faiths and backgrounds to provide different 
skills, but not so diverse that members cannot tolerate each other or 
practice forbearance. We have had trouble with Vriddi members who saw 
their roles as vehicles to express social and religious snobbery, and 
we have given up trying to include Sarku worshippers in parties containing 
most ofther faiths. Dlamelish and Hrihayal tend to create social/sexual 
problems for some players, too, while all others seem to get along a 
little better. Of course, fanatics of all persuasions are generally not 
included: e.g. a strongly missionising priest of Thumis is almost as 
unpleasant as a stern and uncompromising follower of Chegarra or Gruganu.

Our solution is to let players find their own levels. If they act out of 
character, or if they are so rigid and fanatic as to create problems, the 
referee can swiftly provide corrections.

It was Mridobu and the Baron, but they came in the front door. Mridobu 
was disguised as an ordinary priest of Ksarul, sent on a mission to the 
Emperor. There are so many people coming and going that it was not 
detected until too late. The temple of Ksarul used a lot of spells to 
disguise Mridobu, and the rest of his own party did not even know it was 
he. As for the Baron, he was Dhich'une's ally until very recently. So... 
nobody has tried to get into the citadel THROUGH the magical defences for 
a very long time!

I only recall one party that flew over Avanthar in an aircar. The effect 
was rather like a ring of blazing light that rose swiftly from the citadel 
and enveloped the car. Apparently it was not set to instant destruction 
because the car continued to limp on southward and crashed in the Bay of 
Jakalla! Apparently the weapons are either automatic or else can be set to 
repel invaders with different degrees of intensity.

[                   ask Phil, what does SPQR stand for?                      ]

The old cities still hold their secrets. Eyloa's house is a major nexus 
point and supply depot, set up before the Time of Darkness, maintained 
during the Latter Times by some one of the local warlords, and expanded 
and further developed during the time of Llyan of Tszamra and the Duru'ob 
Kings. It is stuffed with technological prizes. But it is also thoroughly 
well defenced, both by Eyloa and also by previous residents without his 
knowledge! He does have a submarine (actually a starship with submersible
capabilities), but he doesn't know how to use it. Some of the Undying 
Wizards covet it, too, and he is not likely to have it for long unless he 
does something to protect it better. The Lady Sarvodaya Di'ela (one of the 
less pleasant of the Undying Wizards) is eager to acquire it -- she 
already has a couple of ancient ships that work by "magic."

The submarine emerges from a pen under Eyloa's "House," proably through a 
permanent nexus point, directly into the ocean off the coast of Livyanu 
northeast of Laigas. The method of this is not understood -- and, as I 
recall, Eyloa himself never questioned how the submarine got from under 
the Tlashte Heights directly out into the sea! But,then, he wasn't very 
technologically inclined. As I recall, he hired a crew and taught them 
how to maintain the simpler systems of the ship. Once or twice, he ordered 
it to submerge while a steersman was still topside at the helm! One does 
lose some very good steersmen that way...

That is looking at it from an anthropocentric point of view.  If you look 
at it from the point of view of the flow of energy and resources, there 
were plenty of carnivores, omnivores, detritovores, pollinators, seed 
eaters, grass eaters, fruit eaters, etc.  Perhaps you meant to say that 
there were no giant sloths, no capybara, no giant birds and few fruit bats 
in Europe?

And before that it had its own native flora for eons, then we came and 
wiped them out!  IMHO, the best analogy is the continent of Australasia, 
where a marvellous flora was eliminated by the intervention, conscious 
and unconscious, of man and his domesticated animals (and diseases).  
Man had been in Australia for 40,000 years, and the ecology was by no 
means in equilibria when 'modern man' arrived more recently.  An excellent 
discussion of this is in a book called 'Ecological Imperialism'... I'll 
try and find the authors name... <rummage, rummage> rats, I've lent it

[Moderator's Note:  Bob Alberti adds his ideas to the discussion about Char- ]
[                   acter Group Dynamics.                                    ]

     The question of group dynamics is very complex, and straddles 
that grey line between the player and the "character".

     As Professor Barker points out, Tekumelani social differences are 
extremely difficult to overcome.  In one game I recall, my Ksarul 
priest, Arjai hi Vaisoner of the very high Cloak of Azure Gems clan, 
encountered the famous Captain Harchar when Dave Arneson (of the 
original D&D) came to visit one evening.

     Despite my PERSONAL desire to enjoy Mr. Arneson's visit, Arjai 
would have NONE of it.  In the middle of a very difficult military 
campaign (for which the noble Arjai had consented to assume 
requisition and supply duties for the good of the cause), along came 
this near-Nakomai rogue, this scruffy ruffian, swaggering through the 
camp and messing things up.  Who was he?  How dare he!  As my personal 
dismay grew, the Ksarul priest grew more and more irritated with this 
low-class slimeball.  Finally, someone opened up a nexus point in the 
vicinity, and Captain Harchar decided to stick his head through and 
see what was on the other side.  Arjai seized the opportunity and used 
his "Visitations of the Other Planes" spell to slam the nexus point 
shut, hoping to separate Harchar from his head.  Harchar survived, but 
his scruffy beard was trimmed a few centimeters shorter than it had 
been!

     Along with class differences, there are personal differences 
between the players which sometimes the best roleplayers cannot 
overcome.  We have had enmities between group members which prevented 
otherwise-logical character alignments.  More common are affinities 
between group members which overcome otherwise illogical character 
alignments:  two people who are pals at the table can usually trust 
each other's characters not to stab the other in the back.

     The best role-play overcomes many of these differences while 
keeping the doctrinal schims nicely subtle.  Early in the game, 
Arjai's specialty was the last-minute end-run, aka "taking credit".  
For example, one time our party used magical means to acquire a large 
cache of iron bars.  The party transported this iron to Avanthar, with 
the expressed intent (by the Vimuhla worshippers present) of giving it 
to Mirusiya or maybe the Emperor.  Arjai was able to link up with a 
telepath prior to arriving and notified Prince Mridobu's agents first, 
so that Mridobu received the iron, and Arjai received the credit.

     Nobody in the party got hurt or 'stabbed in the back' -- the 
group was simply met by a different set of OAL guards upon approaching 
Avanthar, and escorted to a different place than they would have been 
to drop off their iron.  The conflict existed and was played out, but 
without bloodshed or even great disagreement between the members.  The 
thanks of an Imperial Prince are a great thing to have, and if its one 
rather than the other, well, that's still pretty good.

     However, things are not always peaches-and-chumetl.  Conflicts 
really came to a head when one of our Vimuhla-worshipping players 
insisted on flirting with Sarku.  Those were difficult times for the 
party and for Professor Barker.  In the midst of a struggle against 
Dhichune and the Worm, an incredibly powerful Vimuhla priestess with 
unique magical abilities (she could "draw energy" out of an area and 
use it for herself!) was seduced by Gereshma'a.

     Distrust of this character increased steadily even as the player 
insisted that her character's behavior was completely logical for that 
character.  Unfortunately, the LOGICAL response by the rest of us 
would be to kill that character as soon as possible!  We were all 
quite distressed.  Arjai attempted to diffuse the situation by means 
of a summoning where Gereshma'a and Jeneksha were to fight it out over 
this mortal ("once and for all") but this nearly turned into a 
Ganga-style disaster!  Fortunately, or unfortunately, for all 
concerned, the character decided after this debacle to have herself 
"purified" by Vimuhla of the Sarku influences... and upon a set of 
bitterly bad dice rolls, perished, permanently.

     So despite the best efforts of everyone involved, this conflict 
was played out to its bitter end.  It was unfortunate, but these 
things do happen.  At such times it is best if the players involved 
can separate themselves from their characters and the conflicts within 
the game -- otherwise people can foster hard feelings.

     The differences between these two circumstances were greatly 
influenced by the goals in each case.  When the goals involved are
some treasure and some credit, the conflict does not get as deadly.  
When one is involved in a civil war and a powerful individual has 
questionable loyalties, death walks close at hand.

>>>Why SHOULD there be exact equivalents of every earth creature on Tekumel. 

There is a distinction which is missing from this discussion, and that 
is the role played (pardon the pun!) by the creatures... in two 
systems!

The first system is the "Natural" system.  In that system, a pig is a 
rooting herbivore.

The second system is the "Human" system.  In that system, a pig is a 
domesticated protein source.

Looked at in this manner, you can see that it's perfectly possible for 
an animal to fulfill one role, but not the other.  The science of 
ecosystems may mandate a "rooting herbivore" to carry out the task of 
oxygenating the soil, unearthing deeply-buried seeds that might 
otherwise not sprout, or whatever it is that make rooting herbivores 
important to an ecosystem.  However, nothing about this role dictates 
that the resulting animal be easily domesticable, high in protein, or 
even particularly tasty.

So while Tekumel may lack pigs, it may not lack for rooting 
herbivores.  I know I'm always out there rooting for the herbivores.  
Rah! Rah!\

Way back in 1977, a Ksarul-worshipping magician of middle status ( and as it
turned out, One of the Four Palace's sleeping agents ) engaged in a little
recreational archaeology, along with a number of others of like mind.
One of the members, despite solemn oaths to the contrary, attempted to keep
the major item found in an otherwise unrewarding and disasterous foray for
himself. The rest of the band were not amused. This mage then paid out his
share of the loot - ah - re-distributed the found artifacts amongst his
brethren - and took possession of the bound and gagged unfortunate.
Shortly aftwerwards, Amidst great ceremony in a nearby (and covert) Ksarul
Shrine, this otherwise healthy, unmarked and unblemished captive had a
ceremonial dagger inserted between the 3rd and 4th cervical vertebrae,
according to the forms. (That same mage and that same dagger appeared in a
starring role in another tale, previously told here..)

The player whose character it was just could not believe what my character
did. A naive young American Lawful amongst us Australian Chaotics, to use
the vernacular common at the time. For a while, there was some bad feeling.
But he got over it. He saw the logic, and was eventually able to separate
his character from himself.

[Moderator's Note:  Tekunu provides the following information on Eyloa's    ]
[                   house.                                                  ]

Yes Indeed!  I Achan Tlashte (formerly Achan hi'Sayanu of Jakalla), 
Champion of Eyloa Tlashte, have indeed traveled in the marvelous item 
that is known as a submarine.  Please be advised that said item is 
presently in an unreachable part of the house these days due to floods 
and an infestation of some sort.  The nexus access to the submarine pens 
has also moved, making it unreachable.  Somewhere I have a map of a Hlyss 
ship....at least as far as I got in it.  We attacked it in the submarine.....  
Let me say I will never ever ever go on a submarine again.

Eyloa's house is indeed a marvelous place full of passages and wonders.  
I had attempted to map the house only to find out tha the house had 
shifted at times through the planes.  In other words a map is only as 
good as the day upon which it was made.  Eyloa's house is located in 
several micro universes with access to and from nexus points.  Some parts 
do not move.  The main gate is defended by several lightning bringers in 
copula's.  Directly ahead is a hall with a formal reception area for the 
King of Tlashte Heights on the left and the reception area for his other 
titles on the right.  Further to the right is the Hall of Remembrances, 
and the Hall of Contemplation.  Beyond this is the Hall of Guests (leading 
to the the guest areas, library, ru'un firing range, tub room, ru'un 
pleasure servants, museum of curiosities.  Finally the Hall of Victory leads 
to forbidden areas of the house.  Further to the left are the permanent 
residences of the servants of Tlashte.  Including myself.  Sevice Automoton 
centers are in this area.

Being in the house for a period of three years allowed me to relate the
wonderous items contained within but let me note this:  Never....and I 
repeat never....take or even contemplate using items of great power.  
There are those who are always watching for these items.  Most of these 
items have been claimed by the mighty ones.  To show or use them will 
only cause them to be taken away.  So you might as well give them up 
right away. 

In my days as an adventurer, whenever I strode forth in Achan's Power
Armour with Demon Swords and Eyes of all Kinds, I usually was up to my 
neck in trouble, chased through the planes and the like.  But.....
whenever I went forth in Chlen Hide, with a simple steel sword (in a 
Chlen Hide scabbard), and only carried a Ring of Recall and a simple 
eye or two .... I was never bothered and could travel freely.  I learned 
this lesson when traveling down a road in my youth.  I travelled in great 
style with sedan chairs, guards, concubines, cooks, etc. etc. etc.   
Every night and day the greater beasts, creatures and groups of men would 
attack me furiously and yet when I looked off to the side of the road 
there were farmers in the fields peacefully working.  How could this be?  
How could they work with all of these nasties trying to kill them? La Ho 
it is because the beasts think them not worthy.  Therefore I learned to 
travel in disguise.  It works, don't laugh.

I Tekunu hi'Qolyelmu have found my original notes and maps (of my fief 
and the underground beneath) that were expressed in Part Two/Volume Three 
of the Solitaire Adventures by the Great One.  With your permission I will 
relate these journal entries for those who wish to know what it was like 
being a player in that adventure.

I Tekunu hi'Qolyelmu of the Golden Sunburst am the Anseknekus of the Fief
of Jikutlar (hex 3016 on the old map). I am a landed noble with my immediate
entourage of about 100 persons.  Of my followers I take special note of
Daragma  hi Turugda and his son Gubanu who are my hunter and messenger
respectively.  My Fief takes up about a third of the hex and consists of 
my house in the central east with the following towns and villages: Numar,
Semus, Chuluga, Mritl, Diride, Tekunek, and Mashtla.  To the Northwest is 
the fief of Ajinasa, under Vriyatal hi Semen, to the northeast and east is
Mirikanu under Beshkma hi Zharmuru and to the south east and south is the fief
of Achura under juragjishu hi Nyelatsar.  To the West and South is my good
friend Tekenta hi Talkelmu, a Dlamelish worshipper that I used to dally with
in my youth and have an affection for to this day.   I have the usual
retainers Arko the Butler, Bedha the Cook.

8th of Trantor:  The arecheology team is back in the pits.  Ssu remains in
the pits.  The area was not all man made, this is obvious to me.  Some of
this was a natural cavern.  A huge steel mace is recovered by myself but I
left it in the pit.  Engvanyali, Benlgen, and Square Characters are written
on the walls.  All under the ssu area are the spores (ssugun).  
A number of people digging from the temple of Hnalla.  It appears we have 
the local students clubs for the archeologists.  During the past few days 
there are no longer my serveants and peasants working.  They have been 
taken off the case.  I request that I be kept informed.  I order a 
reception for the students in the garden after sunset.  I have decided to 
open the dig to all temples in the hopes that with no secrecy they will 
fight over the rights for years allowing me to explore in the meantime.  
I have some hesitation in allowing the worm-boys in but I should let every 
temple be represented.

9th Trantor:  We find a collapsed building.  A chimney about seventy feet
leads to the west.  I lead the exploration.  We enter two connected rooms and
proceed into a cavernous area.  A beast dwells there that I slay and we
explore the six exits.  Looking around we find more script on the wall.  We
find a tube that is about 4 inches in diameter that looks like a wasps nest.
 Everything is quiet through the area.  Pottery is found with Eng. designs.
 We leave and come back.  The monster's body is not here.  We widen passages
and bring slaves down to help establish this area as a base camp.  We seal
off the four corridors that lead south, south west, west, and west. The
corridor to the northwest has a four foot by four foot marker 3/8 to 1/4 inch
thick white metal that is coated with enamal.   It has lettering.  This is a
small hole next to the marker. There being a box behind the marker.  When the
marker is pulled away a lump is inside the box.  There is also a metalic
object a  about 6 inches in diameter contained within.  We opne the tube and
find a document a spell of regeneration.  There is another document that is
written in a similar language as the sign.  It appears to be a commentary to
the language.  Decree and translation of the language.  Ancient Script and a
translation in a newer language.  This could be the key to translate all of
the script we may find down here.  A stairwell is in front of us.  I decide
not to go down but to take the final passage first.  We pull back and head up
the passageway going north.  On the wall are heavy mosaic letters. These are
new and different from what we have seen.  In a small chamber we find an egg.
 It must be to the monster we killed.  Karenuma (A Hnalla Priest and a
theorist of languages) who came along with us notes that  we are seeing a
succession of scripts from the later times until about 300 years ago.  We
travel through a twisted area of natural rock to the north east until we
reach a cul de sac.  The two exits leading northeast and northwest are
blocked.  The corridor to the northwest that leads to the stairwell down
appears to be the only way out other than the series of rooms we came
through.  We leave and will return on the morrow after the slaves have made
this area more habitable.

(I will continue if you wish to hear more, it does get more exciting I
promise)
