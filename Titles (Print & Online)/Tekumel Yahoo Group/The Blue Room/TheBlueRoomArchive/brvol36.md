These messages are the accumulation of the messages that were sent out on 
the Blue Room email list between May 1995 and June 2000.  A large portion 
of the information is directly from Professor M.A.R Barker. When the list 
members joined during the time the list was active, they agreed to refrain 
from sharing this data with non list members.  When the list ended, it was 
urged that the data be made available to non-list Tekumel fans, and it 
seemed like a good idea all around.

I only ask that if you download these digests, or have received them in 
some other way, please respect the agreements the list members made, and 
refrain from passing them around and instead point people to the Tekumel 
web site, www.tekumel.com so that they can download them for themselves, 
and see all the other material available on the Tekumel.com web site.

Many Thanks.

[Moderator's Note:  Professor Barker answers Andreas' questions.          ]

I honestly have no real idea, not being very musical. My wife (who is from
India and used to play the sitar)suggested the diatonic scale sounded like
my sad imitations of Tekumelani music. I think that's all I can say on the
matter. Compose your own music, and I am sure we'll all enjoy singing along!

>2) About the Urunen. According to the Gamescience Sourcebook and the

The Urunen region is roughly like northern Europe, with colder regions
inland near the Pole. The region is remote from human settlements. The
Ancients before the Time of Darkness and of the Latter Times probably felt
the place was too uninviting to bother with. The Urunen thus happened to be
the nearest race with boats and a will to explore. Other races were too
distant or ecologically too different; e.g. the Chima are mostly marine and
do not settle large bodies of land (they dwell on floating clumps of reed
and raft-boasts and live on certain species of seaweed and algae). The
Hokun would have been interested, but by the time they got across the seas
down there, the Urunen had already occupied the place and fought bitterly
to keep it.

>3) The fall of Engsvan hla Ganga. According to all the sources, this
>catastrophe had widespread effects - the rise and sinking of lands,
>disrupted weather patterns, etc. Am I right to assume that not only the
>Tsolyanu continent was affected ? That ALL of Tekumel suffered (indirectly)

>? Even in the case of the Urunen lands mentioned above ?

The Urunen are probably too far away, although some effects could indeed be
seen by distant peoples. As with Krakatoa or the great Siberian meteor,
there were undoubtedly upheavals and cataclysms. No one has ever managed to
put all of these occurrences together, and most people imagine their own
earthquakes, etc. to be local.

>4) And now for something completely different. I am currently reading quite
>a bit of cultural anthropology, and I have stumbled upon the subject of

>Tekumel ?).

Lissutl root is indeed a powerful contraceptive. It seems to have been
developed deliberately from a plant that grows on one of the Pe Choi
worlds. It is pleasant-tasting and without serious side effects. It is
fairly well known all over Tekumel. There are various places -- remote and
tribal societies -- where it is not known, of course.

l.But what when a woman accidentally does get pregnant ? Are the

Sounds like fun. Most unwanted/unexpected children are raised by the
father's clan (if he is known -- if not, then by the mother's clan). They
are brought up in the clan schools and are trained in some craft or skill.
The brighter of them go on to become clan chamberlains, servants, cooks, or
one of dozens of less-prestigious skills. Remember, "player characters" and
their friends are almost all from the highest strata of society -- or are
from the lowest groups. Very few are tailors, seamstresses, pot-washers,
butchers, etc. These people are still members of their clans, but they are
clearly "lower-class" or even "peripheral."  How else would the great
clanhouses be stocked with servants and other personnel? Slaves often come
from lower-class clansmen who have somehow offended against the social
order -- or who are sold by their clans for debt, crime, etc. (There are
some high-class slaves, too, mostly criminals or bad gamblers!)

>Are there cases of 'indirect' infanticide ('accidentally' rolling over

I have never heard about an "Engelmacherin" on Tekumel. If someone
absolutely cannot care for a child, the latter may be dropped off in front
of some temple (Thumis,Avanthe, usually) or at the door of a clanhouse
known to be hospitable. After all, a waif can be brought up as agricultural
labourer, thus saving the price of a slave.

I don't have much written on the lower strata of other societies on
Tekumel. I'll see what I can find out.

Enjoy!

[                   blind barter.  Many of you confirm one another's report]
[                   of blind bartering (and a fictional account, too).     ]

Scott Maxwell writes...
The Pygmy folk ( I do not recall their actual name) in Africa participate in
blind barter with the tribes that surround them.  It is a little more
complicated than that the professor described, however.

A blanket is laid out and the tribe (non pygmy) lays what they want to
barter on it.  The Pygmy come come out of their forest and put what they are
willing to give for their stuff; they remove anything that they do not want
from the blanket.  The Pygmy leave and the other tribe returns.  If they
like the deal they take the pygmy stuff and the stuff that the pygmy
rejected and leaves, otherwise they remove pygmy stuff and/or their own
stuff until they find it equitable and leave.  Though theoretically this
"Ballancing of goods" may go on indefinitely, it rarely does.  The tribes
are fairly symbiotic in their trade needs and they know if they screw their
trade partner that it is not likely that they'll trade again, so everyon is
very honest and it rarely goes beyond the first "evening out" by the pygmy.
In any case, when one side takes the trade goods, the bartering is over and
the other side takes whatevr remains.

See, Anthropology classes in college ARE worth something. ;)

Scott

Leonard Erickson writes...

I don't have any primary sources. I've read some accounts referring to
the practice (which apparently dates back to the Phoenicians trading on
the coast of Africa. The *Atlantic* coast...)

A good description occurs in (of all things) Heinlein's "Citzen of the
Galaxy". 

But the essence is that you lay the goods out in seperated piles
forming a long line. Then you retreat to a distance where you can keep
an eye on things (and discourage the other party from simply grabbing
what they want).

The other party looks things over for a while and then lays out their
"offers" opposite your piles and then they pull back.

You consider the offers for a while. If you like an offer, you just
leave things as is. But maybe you don't like the goods being offered,
so you either take back that pile, or move it to another location along
the line. Either gets the point across.

More often, you'll want to "haggle". So you may split your pile into
two piles. This basicly says "I like the goods you are offering, but
you've *got* to be kidding about the price". Or you subtract a bit form
the pile. This says "How about dropping the price a bit?"

And you wait for their counter offer. They can do the same sort of
thing with their bids.

Eventually, none of the piles have changed in a while. So you gather up
their offers and leave your stuff that it had been bid for. You leave,
they gather the stuff they'd bid for.

It's a rather leisurely method of doing business. But it has the
advantage that you don't need to know the language, and neither side
exposes itself to more than the absolute minimum of hazard.

Andreas Baede writes...

As you probably already guessed, silent trade, silent barter, or dumb trade
is something known on Earth as well.
The ancient Carthaginians and Vikings practised it on their trading
voyages, and it is also known from other places. The Ituri pygmies
(hunter-gatherers living in the Ituri rainforest in Zaire), for instance,
used silent trade to exchange meat for bananas with their Bantu
agricultural neighbours. On Sri Lanka, the Veddas, who were also
hunter-gatherers, traded honey for iron tools with the Sinhalese farmers. I
think others will be able to bring up more examples, I can remember that
silent trade also occurred quite frequently in the course of the voyages of
discovery. 
Silent trade seems to occur mostly where the two partners are not able to
communicate because of language barriers. In time, one or both partners
will learn the other's language, and more usual trade relations will be
established. However, where the trade partners are members of radically
different societies (for instance, Stone Age hunter-gatherers versus Iron
Age farmers, like in the cases of the Ituri and the Veddas) silent trade
will remain in use.

Silent trade does not only suggest that both sides don't just understand
each other, but that they mistrust each other, too.
The exchange of goods between strangers is always a tricky thing; while the
exchange of goods and services between relatives is usually based on trust
and mutual obligation, between strangers there's always the suspicion of
being cheated or robbed. Trade could easily lead to quarrels and violence,
especially face to face trade. I give you this from "Yngvar's Saga": 

'Next day, Svein's men went ashore yet again to trade with the natives and
for a while they exchanged goods, until one of the Russians (Vikings) tried
to break an agreement he had just made to buy some furs. When the heathen
(this source is from the 13th century, the Viking in question was almost
certainly a heathen himself) lost his temper and punched him on the nose so
that the blood poured onto the ground , the Russian drew his sword and
sliced the heathen in two."

Well, given the risks of face to face trade, no wonder some people
preferred silent trade !

I know of blind barter occurring on earth in archaic times in Greece.

Vikings used Blind Barter in trading with Nomadic people like the Huns and
others who they could not raid successfully.  If memory serves me
correctly, they used an example of it in the Runequest Vikings box produced

The mentions of "Blind Barter" on Tekumel have always reminded me of 
the "silent auction" described in _Citizen of the Galaxy_ by Robert A.
Heinlein.  It is described in Chapter 12 of that SF novel (pg. 128-130 
in my 1978 Del Rey Ballantine paperback edition).

"-the silent auction invented by trading Phoenicians when the shore of
Africa ran beyond the known world."

The description runs about 2 & 1/2 pages.

On the planet Finster, the native sophonts have neither speech nor 
writing.  The Sisu (a trading starship) puts out piles of trade goods
around the ship.  Unlike the description of the Tekumel practice 
(where no one stays to watch the goods, IIRC), the Sisu keeps a gun 
turret manned to keep the Finsterians honest.

The Finsterians put out piles of their trade goods next to 
Sisu's piles.  Thus offering a particular pile for another.

There is a length period of maneuvering, basically haggling in slow
motion, by splitting your pile, or waiting for the Finsterians to make
their pile bigger, or moving your pile near something else you like
better, etc.

The whole process takes some weeks.

The twist in CotG is that they discover almost accidentally that the
Finsterians will pay well in jewels for colored pages from adventure comic
books and pin-up magazines.

More about blind barter 

Pretty sure that there are accounts of blind barter involving the
following cultures 

Phoenicians and coastal Africans - look up the accounts of Hanno's trip
down the West African coast  in any decent book on Carthage - there may
also be something in Herodotus.  

Vikings and Slavs/Finns - Am pretty sure that a 9th or 10th century
Arab traveller (something like Ibn Fadhlan ? - the one who also
describes the Varangian funeral with the human sacrifice)talks about
blind barter between the Varangians and the Finnish and Slavic tribes
who lived along the Russian river routes from the Baltic to
Constantinople - any good book on Early Russia or on the Vikings should
quote him. 

The sort of barter the professor describes between the Pechani and Ssu
rather sounds to me like the sort of thing that might happen with a
small out of the way village who've been leaving stuff out for the Ssu
on a certain night of the year since time immemorial and thus may also
have similarities to the behaviour of cargo cults - or maybe the Ssu
regard it as a form of tribute and accordingly don't raid that
particular village. 

Andrew - Red Ssu ???

UCon's Tekumel Track went so well last year, we're doing it again -- but
we can't do it without GMs willing to run Tekumel events!

This is the first call for Tekumel-related events for UCon 1999's Tekumel
Track.  Events can be run using any game system, offical, unofficial, home-
brewed... we don't care, as long as it's Tekumel.  Last year we had a
number of table-top RPGs, a live-action RPG, miniatures events, a Kevuk
event, and several seminars.  So far this year, we only know for certain
about a large live-action event (it'll be Saturday night this time, so
those who need to fly out or drive long distances on Sunday won't miss
out... and it may even be catered with Tsolyani dishes!), one or two
tabletop RPGs, and some seminars (including a repeat of Professor
Barker's open question and answer seminar "The Gods Will Tell It To
You!", but two hours long this time). We need lots more...

UCon is held from November 12th-14th, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA (which
is 25-30 minutes from Detroit Metropolitan Airport -- DTW -- a major
Northwest Airlines hub).  Discounted hotel rates are available; crash
space may also be available for impoverished Tekumel fans (especially if
they're running events...;-)

Information about UCon is available at http://www.deathstar.org/~ucon; you
can also register your events there, but if you do make sure you also
email me so I can coordinate the Track and make sure we have events in
every single time slot again.

Interested?  Contact me, Joe Saul, at jmsaul@umich.edu, or by phone at
(734) 429-0027 (Eastern Time Zone).

>Could I have some information about the Island of Dlanta?  Who has control
>of it?  Salarvya?  Haida Pakala? Independant?

Dlanta is a singularly unpleasant little place: a tumbled mass of stones
and scrub jungle rising right up out of the sea. Straight, buff-coloured
cliffs filled with little holes in which millions of gull-like Deshqa-birds
(the name is Salarvyani) nest and drop unpleasant gifts down upon those who
would want to climb. The place is more easily accessible at the lower
eastern end, where the scruffy town of Be'esa lies. Be'esa exports figs and
other sea creatures, some of the black whelks that provide the Salarvyani
with their favoured black dye, a small number of pearls and coral, etc. The
rulers of the place have a rather wretched "palace" atop the westernmost
hill in Be'esa. For much of this century the Salarvyani have ruled the
island, but older records also suggest some degree of independence. I don't
recall that the Haida Pakalani ever controlled the island, although they do
have sizeable businesses and ship-refitting yards outside Be'esa along the
coast to the southwest. Most raw materials have to be imported, as there is
little timber. The locals used to exist on a grey-green thorny plant called
Nmidz, which they clean, boil, and turn into a sort of mush. Now, however,
there are foodstuffs imported from Gunurum Isle across the straits.

The majority of the population is Salarvyani. Haida Pakalani
pirates/businessmen make up a good percentage, as do Ahoggya from the
Sharuna Lowlands. These last have their own foods and section of the city,
and their boxy, awful-smelling ships ply the seas over to Keruna. A few
enterprising Ahoggya have undertaken the long journey farther east to the
Isles of Ill Winds and Onmu Tle Hlektis.

>Which culture has the most influence on the inhabitants?

Salarvyani. These inhabitants are industrious and avaricious. They do the
fishing, building, dyeing, and other crafts, and their leaders occupy most
of the seats in the local governor's council. The Salarvyani are touchy and
quick to impale and/or enslave offenders. Their social code is complex and
almost unintelligible to outsiders.

>Any preferences in God?

They would prefer a God who exists and can help them in their squalid
lives.  They are thus happiest with Salarvya's Shiringgayi. Various other
deities have small shrines in Be'esa as well: of Pavar's pantheon, Avanthe
and Karakan have larger followings than the others; Hru'u, Thumis, and
Sarku are not popular at all. Dlamelish is quite popular, however, since
she is considered to be one "Aspect" of Shiringgayi, and her worshippers
admittedly have more "fun." The Salarvyani apparently see no
contradictions. One can see men and women bearing terrible scars inflicted
at the orgies of Hrihayal, too. Those who bear up well under this
punishment are considered heroes and are fed and well-treated by the
community.

>Any quirks that you could share?

About the only recreation in Dlanta is drinking black Dronu and gambling,
aside from the aforementioned orgies. . No one gambles with the Haida
Pakalani, of course; their clever cheating is famous! Younger men and girls
vie in swimming, catching dangerous shark-fish, diving for pearls (not very
good near in to shore), and racing one another along the narrow, rocky
beaches.  The Salarvyani family system is maintained, with complex codes of
behaviour and duties.

Not a place I would recommend for a holiday.

Phil

Thanks for answering my questions (anyone having tips for Tekumelani music:
welcome ! I consider creating an unofficial list of 'recommended music for
Tekumel', which I'll send to the Blue Room. You can contact me at
croesawu@xs4all.nl). 

I have some additional questions regarding the Urunen, the Hokun and the
southern hemisphere.

1)  How large is the island continent of the Urunen ? Where does it lie
exactly, in terms of degrees south latitude (if it is comparable, say, to
Antarctica below 80 degrees south latitude, it would have a diameter of
about 2,100 kilometres. Since Tekumel is larger than the Earth, you could
pack quite a nice little continent south of the 80th parallel - and leave
lots of room in the cooler regions of the southern hemisphere). What is the
location of the South Pole relative to the Urunen continent, next to it,
right smack in the middle of it, or what ? Does there exist a map of the
Urunen home ?
To what degree are the Urunen still 'isolated' ? There is now contact with
the Five Empires through the tubeways, and they've been in conflict with
the Hokun. Obviously, there is no maritime contact with human populations.
But is there maritime contact with other races, like the Hokun ? And is it
possible that there are human populations 'just' a couple of thousand
kilometres away across the ocean ? Such a distance, comparable to the
distance between Britain and Greenland, would make Human-Urunen contact
difficult (throw in a few icebergs and things really get tricky) and
unlikely provided there are no substantial intervening islands. Unless an
Urunen Eric the Red comes along, of course. (Or a lost fisherman or so - I
can remember reading about an Eskimo who got lost and ended up in the
British isles, I believe in the 17th century). To put it bluntly, how much
'white space' is still left in real Tekumel below 50 degrees south latitude
? (my impression is almost all of it) I have plans to take my players 'down
south' in the long run, and I'd like avoiding a clash with 'real Tekumel'
as much as possible.

2)  The Hokun were mentioned by Professor Barker as having fought with the
Urunen over the Antarctic continent. I am getting somewhat paranoid about
them. The original Gamescience book and the Bestiary gave me the impression
that they were a dangerous species, but not particularly numerous.
Certainly no threat to the Human domination of Tekumel (although they were
mentioned as a 'serious' threat to it). But now I'm seeing Hokun
everywehere; if I interpret Professor Barker's earlier comments correctly,
they're crawling all over the other side of the northern hemisphere, and
they've been (and still are ?) in the southern hemisphere as well. Are the
Hokun still a threat to the Urunen and other Alien and Human societies in
the southern Hemisphere ? Do they maintain a major presence there ? And do
they LIKE cold climates (since the professor mentioned that they would've
been interested in the Antarctic continent)

3)  Concerning the great southern continent, earlier comments by Bob Alberti
stated that it is shaped roughly like a long oval or rounded rectangle and
covers half the southern hemisphere.  Is there any more specific
information, for instance, the continent's dimensions in kilometres or
miles and its location in terms of degrees latitude and longitude ? I know
that it's mostly 'terra incognita', but if I know what is already 'known'
in real Tekumel, I can fill in some of the blanks in my own future campaign
without contradicting the 'official' stuff.

Sincerely,
Andreas Baede

        It would hammer the planet flat.  "The Time of No Kings" was
subtitled "The Time of No Food."  You're talking a level of vulcanism not
seen since the stars fell from the sky -- and -that- Time of Darkness
lasted, some scholars say, for fifty thousand years.

        Rolling up -every- river valley from -every- coastline you'd have
exactly the kind of tsunami of mud that Sir Charles Wooley found in
Mesopotamia in 1923, that caused him to telegraph "We have found the
Flood".  It might take a century for the gigatons of volcanic particulates
to settle out of the upper atmosphere, for the weather to stabilize and the
climate to return to normal... and in the meantime, just -forget- anything
but the scrawniest of hard-scrabble subsistence agriculture.  There would
be vast areas where humans died out altogether.

        That kind of existence -requires- myth and magic, which is why all
those wonderful stories and legends arose, sparkling with awe and great
deeds.  People need something to chew on, when sufficient food is not
available; they need legends and glory to warm themselves and give hope to
their children, huddling in the dark and the cold endless rain and mud.

        (But from an anthropological point of view, it's interesting to see
what did -not- arise: A vengeful and judgmental God of blood sacrifices and
fearful worship.  That seems to come naturally to human psychology-- but of
course, the position was already filled, by proven and puissant entities
who would -not- have been amused.)

Thanks, I have done so.  The vignette of the testing of an aspiring
Hru'u priestess is genuinely chilling.

Mitlanyal mentions an ancient Bednalljan deity known as Gyanu, who was
identified by the great Pavar as the 5th aspect of Hru'u.  Howevever, no
information beyond the name and great age of this entity is given.  I
would be greatful if any theological or historical scholars could provide
more information.  The worship of Hru'u first occurs in the early
centuries of the First Imperium, and I suspect he may first have been
known as Gyanu, but this is pure speculation.  Any further information
would be welcome.

I feared as much.

I'm not sure what you mean by this last point.  I suspect you mean that
Mirusiya's Imperial administration is squeezing the temples that supported

Imperial contracts, collecting taxes that had been let slide before,
failing to renew leases, etc. Or did the new Emperor arrange for his
own appointees within the temple hierarchy itself?

Many thanks.  I have already located a suitable candidate myself, one
Chamangesh hiTirrune of the Iron Helm clan, originally of Meku, late of
Jakalla. A scholar priest, he specializes in the many influences on mind
and thought, sorcerous, pharmaceutical, and acoustic.  Interestingly,
he has many similarities with Onorel:  he speaks Salarvyani and Livyani
(and reads several ancient languages); is unmarried, and though not ruled
by them, has (or had) several female companions; he's an inveterate
gambler (excessive losses were the lever Charash used to "induce" him onto
the expedition), and is a pleasant social companion.  Oh, and he also is
no fighter.

He was (having now left aboard the Mokaltokoi Tsomun), a relatively recent
arrival to Jakalla, and found the city very much to his liking.  If anyone
can give me more information about the temples of Hru'u and/or Wuru there,
I would be especially grateful.

regards,

George H.

Concerning Andreas Baede's question about Tsolyani music, I recall reading
(or did I just think it?) that to some extent Tsolyani music resembles
Indonesian gamelan music.  I can't remember much about gamelan music now. 
It is played on large metallic drums.  Don't know what tonal or harmonic
system they use. 

I also recall reading somewhere (sourcebook?) that lisutl root is a
contraceptive and a larger dose causes abortion/miscarriage.  If this is
right then Andreas' question concerning unwanted pregnancies disappears,
except in very odd circumstances.

And now for some miscellaneous questions of my own concerning the physical
properties of chlen hide...

Will a chlen hide object float on water, like wood?  Does it have any
discernable "grain" or organic texture, or is it a thoroughly homogenous
substance, like plastic?  Are there different quality grades of chlen
hide?

Does it burn like wood?  Does it rot?  How do the Tsolyani dispose of
broken old chlen hide objects - does the stuff sit around in landfill like
Terran plastic?  Can it be recycled by resoftening it (via the chemicals
used by the tanner's guild) or is the tanning process a once-only thing?

Have I just asked a bunch of FAQ's?

[Moderator's Note:  Malcolm Heath discusses gamelan music.                  ]

Regarding gamelan music, for what it's worth:  

Having studied gamelan for some time, mostly Javanese, some Balinese, and
no Sundanese (they are each very very different), it never struck me as
being particularly Tekumeliyani. That's just my opinion, however, and the
descriptions in the source book are evocative of gamelan, to be sure.  

If anyone is interested, though, a point of clarification.  Gamelan is
played in large ensembles of from between 3 and 30 musicians and singers,
and most of the instruments are what we might call xylophones in the west.
There are drums and flutes and some bowed instruments as well.  Most of
the instruments would be classified as metallophones, and are made of
bronze, or iron.  Numerous gongs are played, and the gong ageng (great
gong, in the sense of large/important) reminds me of the tunkel gongs of
the temples, although these are probably much larger.  The tuning systems
are (at least in Javanese and Balinese varieties) either an equally spaced
pentatonic scale, or a heptatonic (seven note) scale.  

There are some interesting points of connection though.  In Bali and Java,
a very old form of the language called Kawi is used in music and theater,
as well as in ceremony; this strikes me similar to the use of Engsvanyali
for singing epics, for example.

The famous Javanese shadow-puppet plays (called wayang) are originally
from India, and there are mentions in the source book to something very
very similar.

On the general subject of Earthly musical amalgams of Tekumeliyani music,
I have always thought that the Sra'ur could be thought of as the Indian
sarod; the Tenturen reminds me of the Japanese koto, perhaps, and the
"delicate syncopation of the Pei Choi log-xylophones" as either the
amadinda music from Uganda, or perhaps something like the mbira and later
mariba music from Zimbabwe.  

In general, when I need to describe music on Tekumel, I'll fall back to
Indian sources, and maybe put on some G.S. Sachdev, or some Shankar in the
background...it seems to fit better, and while it's still somewhat alien
to Western ears, it's easier for most to grip than gamelan.

Greetings Tekumel fans!

Just to inform you of a small update to www.tekumel.com ... a couple 
of changes have been made to make the site easier to view and read. I 
have changed the font from a serif to a sans serif typeface for 
increased readability, and set font sizes to give PC users a more 
attractive experience. In addition the Lands section has had its 
navigation system fixed - I did away with the popup window approach, 
so things are simpler and easier to use now.

I'd be interested in what people would like to see next on the site - 
should I continue with the maps, or start a new section 
(languages/scripts? ... social structures?). Opinions welcomed!

The Gamelan music I have heard uses variously tuned cylinders, rather like
a xylophone. This, plus drums and other instruments, makes for very pretty
music. In ancient India there was an instrument called a "Jaltarang": a set
of delicate pottery bowls, into which different amounts of water were
poured. When struck by the player with a  little stick, elegant bell-like
tones were produced. Various of these methods are used by the Tsolyani, as
well as horns, drums, flutes, and others.

>I also recall reading somewhere (sourcebook?) that lisutl root is a
>contraceptive and a larger dose causes abortion/miscarriage.  If this is

You are right. There is a drawback, however: a large dose of Lisutl root is
not very pleasant, however: it creates nausea and stomach cramping before
it succeeds in aborting the fetus. Tekumelani women prefer to use Lisutl to
*prevent* conception, not terminate it!

>And now for some miscellaneous questions of my own concerning the physical

>Will a chlen hide object float on water, like wood?  Does it have any

Chlen-hide is rather like some plastics: it does sink, but slowly.  It is
rather like elephant/rhinoceros hide: it is thinner under the animal's arms
and at its stomach, and thicker on the shoulders and back. It doesn't
really have a "grain," although the tanners know how to peel it off in
large flat sheets. There are indeed various "grades" of the stuff: a large,
powerful Chlen-beast produces sheets an inch or two thick and 3-4 feet in
diametre. A smaller, sickly, ill-fed beast produces rather soft and raggedy
sheets about 2 x 2. These can be used for daggers but not for good quality
swords. Smaller scraps are used for arrow and spear points, smaller parts
of armour, and some tools and knives.

>Does it burn like wood?  Does it rot?  How do the Tsolyani dispose of
>broken old chlen hide objects - does the stuff sit around in landfill like
>Terran plastic?  Can it be recycled by resoftening it (via the chemicals

Chlen-hide does not burn. It smoulders. It slowly dries up, becoming
fragile and easily broken with age. It is then discarded since it is
apparently not possible to rejuvenate it. If buried under earth, or sunk
into water, it eventually dissolves and becomes soft and limp.

>Have I just asked a bunch of FAQ's?

We might eventually like to set up a set of fAQ's.

Phil

Or not-quite-similar to singing in Latin in the Middle Ages?

>very similar.

Yes, indeed. The Battle of Dormoron Plain is dramatised, both with puppets
and with "still" tableaux. In the latter, the actors dress in elaborate
costumes and makeup and pose in traditional positions while the singers
recite stanzas relating to this plot element. A few others of the Great
Epics are dramatised in the same way.

I have never used music at our games. I don't know why. I can hear music,
but as a producer of it, I am clueless. Usually our players are too busy
exchanging jokes and badinage to even hear what *I* am saying. I sometimes
have to bellow -- or bring in new waves of gigantic monsters and foemen to
get attention. (Joke!)   [No it's not!!! ;)  Chris]

Nuff sed.

I have 7 or eight copies of Man of Gold (most really good shape, one with a

interested in the game but a divorce and etc. took the game away so if 
anyone wants them, I'll let them go for $4.00 each plus postage...

I have a copy of Flamesong but it's harder to find...

[Moderator's Note:  Michael Schwartz asks about Chaigari and a certain Legion.]

Hey folks,

I am working up an event for U-CON this November which follows the 
exploits of the Legion of the Many-Legged Serpent (20th Imperial Medium 
Infantry) on campaign in Chaigari Protectorate during its 2041 conquest 
by Emperor Gyesmu "the Iron Fist". Is there any information fellow 
list-members can impart about this ill-starred Legion, its officers at 
the time, local clans hostile toward Tsolyanu, and the terrain of the 
Kanayugara River Pass?

The major river which runs east from the plains north of Ferinara to 
Hekellu is labeled the He'eka River on the TOME map. Hekellu sits on the 
shores of a small lake, however, and the river which runs east from 
Hekellu to Sirsum and then southeast along the border of Chaigari (along 
the old Sakbe Road) into Ssuyal and Pechano is unlabelled. Contrary to 
the piece on Chaigari I transcribed way back in Message 823, I don't 
believe this is the Kanayugara River and Pass.

I surmise that the Pass itself, and the river after which it is named, is 
represented by the row of rough terrain running between Tlani Hidallu and 
Kakri Midallu Peaks (Gamescience Map 2, hexes 3527, 3427, 3328) which 
denote the border between Chaigari and Kerunan. Also, the Professor 
mentions in Message 979 that a secondary road runs along that border from 
Fenul to Hekellu... a reasonably direct route from Hekellu to Fenul, and 
thus an appropriate choice.

Thoughts? Opinions?

[Moderator's Note:  Heather Moore asks about a Tsolyani native and is looking]
[                   for more information on her.                             ]

When I contemplate running anything involving Tekumel, I persistently dance
about involving a particular young lady; the germ of almost any character I
begin developing somehow diverts itself into relating to her in some obscure
way. The strange thing is that when I try to force her development, I keep
getting hung up on the specifics, so I shall send them here and inquire
whether this is possibly a lady with whom the Professor or any other Tekumel
"visitors" have had any acquaintance or knowledge, to help me fill in the
details.

The lady in question is a fairly young adult, in her mid to late twenties.
She was born into a rather high clan, a family of Dlamelish devotees, and
exasperated her relatives to no end when she declared herself Aridani and
scooted off to marry a much older priest of Ketengku, 'defecting' to that
faith. Her husband was of lower clan than she was -- not considerably so,
but enough to irritate her very appearance-conscious mothers. She was her
husband's disciple and aide for several years before she became pregnant,
and during this time she was recognized by the Temple of Ketengku as fairly
gifted in some of the traditional functions of that priesthood. Now she is a
widow, her husband having died in service during the Civil War in some
capacity which caused him to be posthumously recognized by the Seal. She has
one very young daughter.

I don't know just what her name is; it seems like 'Uma,' but that may not be
it precisely. I'm not sure what her clan or lineage are, or to what clan or
lineage she married. My understanding is that while she doesn't have
anything like a close family connection with her mothers and fathers and
siblings, since the death of her husband she was reclaimed her former clan
identification. They are still annoyed with her religious and life choices,
but the cachet she has gained through her temple's recognition of her and
the Throne's recognition of her late husband has put her in a good odor with
them lately.  I do not know any details of the raising of her daughter,
whether she arranges for the matter herself or whether her own family or her
husband's family has taken over the responsibility.

The lady is attractive and has several suitors, and while she doesn't live
like a chaste maiden of Dilinala, she makes it very clear that her largest
love in life is her work. Apparently she is rather well-liked, somewhat
witty but serious in demeanor. She might be a physician; I cannot tell for
certain whether she has magical ability or not. She either has already begun
or has a strong desire to travel.


Thank you!

Heather Moore

In order to get UCon events into the UCon pre-reg book, I need to know
about them as soon as possible -- preferably by this coming Wednesday, 
29 September 1999.

You don't have to have a complete description; even a brief one will do to
hold the place at this point.  But please DO let me know if you're
planning on running a UCon Tekumel Track event, because I need to handle
Tekumel Track scheduling carefully.

You can reach the UCon website (and register games online) at
    http://www.deathstar.org/~ucon

...and please also email me that you've done so at jmsaul@umich.edu so I
know how many events we have and can start playing with the schedule.

****

This looks to be even better than last year's Tekumel Track -- we'll have
Bob Alberti and Joe Zottola, from Prof. Barker's home campaign, as special
guests (they've volunteered to run an event and do seminars), as well as a
seminar with the Professor himself via speakerphone, a big Saturday-night
live game, the military-oriented free-form that didn't run last year,
plenty of table-top Tekumel RPGing, miniatures... and (hopefully) the
release of Seal of the Imperium Issue 1... and some other things, at least
one of which has to remain a surprise for now.

If you're planning on attending the Tekumel Track and *not* running
anything, this is probably a good time for you to contact me so I can get
a better idea of head count (and therefore know how many spaces should be
in the LARP, how many events we need in each slot, etc.).  People who have
attended last year's should feel free to post reviews, Chris willing -- it
was a blast, and you don't want to miss it this year!

[I am willing.  I even plan to be there, really... (sorry about last year.) ]

UCon's Tekumel Track -- 12-14 November, 1999, Ann Arbor, MI.

The UCon 1999 Gaming Convention will be held in Ann Arbor, Michigan (USA)
from November 12-14 of this year.  It's a high-quality regional convention
with low rates, cheap hotels available, and great facilities.

Last year, we started holding a "Tekumel Track" -- effectively a Tekumel
mini-con piggy-backed onto UCon.  It was a great success, with Tekumel
games running in every time slot (often multiple ones), Tekumel seminars
(including one where Professor Barker answered questions over a
speakerphone for almost two hours), both Carl Brodt and Andy Lorince
selling Tekumel material in the dealers' room, and attendees not only from
the local area, but from both coasts and far Northern Canada.  We even
managed to get a "buzz" going in the general UCon population that led a
number of gamers who previously hadn't experienced Tekumel to join in the
fun.

This year's promises to be even better.

Five members of Professor Barker's campaign are planning to attend and run
events:  Bob Alberti, Joe Zottola, Giovanna Fregni, Keith Dalluhn, and
Victor Raymond.  In addition to that seasoned crew, the same skilled GMs
who ran events last year are planning to come back and do it again -- so
there will be even more choices, and we can accomodate even more people!
I can't give a list of specific events yet (the pre-reg book will become
available in mid-October), but there will be tons of RPG events (including
a large live game developed by Bob Alberti, David Aitken, and myself at
which -- logistics permitting -- Tsolyani refreshments will be served),
more seminars (including the return of Professor Barker's disembodied
voice and one where you can ask Bob about religious matters), and possibly
readings from as-yet-unpublished works about Tekumel.  (Oh yeah... and
maybe a surprise announcement.  ;-)

As always, help is potentially available on crash space (especially for
GMs and those traveling a long way), GMs get in free, and I'll buy all the
beer anyone flying across from the other side of the Atlantic can drink
(as well as doing anything else I can to help within my capabilities).
Weekend admission to the con is $15 pre-reg ($20 at the door); hotels
range from $45-$150 depending on proximity and whether you're from Wicker
Image or Sea Blue.  Meals can be had quite cheaply; this is a college
town. General information about UCon can be found at

    www.deathstar.org/~ucon

Ann Arbor is located in Southeast Michigan, about 45 minutes West of
Detroit and 20 minutes West of Detroit Metropolitan Airport (DTW) along
I-94.  Shuttle service is available from the airport, and pickups can be
arranged if needed.  DTW is a major hub for Northwest Airlines.

Not sure whether you should go?  Ask someone who went last year!

Carl Brodt writes.

Tita's House of Games, c/o Carl Brodt, 1608 Bancroft Way, Berkeley, CA, 
94703-1606, ph. 510-848-3260, has recently bought a huge collection of new 
and used Tekumel-related figures at a large discount, and we have decided to 
pass the benefits of this purchase on to our customers.  For those of you who 
have always wanted to build Tekumel armies, now is the time!

The new figures were largely Bob Richardson's Salarvyani miniatures, and to 
pass on this discount, we have cut our price on those miniatures in half.  
(See our recent posting on the Tekumel newsgroup.)

On the used figures, we are running a "special" on miniatures described below.

Because of the large discounts and great shipping deal (see below), we 
require that the minimum purchase be no less than five of any figure listed 
below.  In order words, you could order 10 Serqu Swords of the Empire and 5 
Legions of Hnalla, but not 10 Serqu Swords of the Empire and 2 Legions of 
Hnalla because the minimum order amount of a given type of figure is 5.

This sale will last until our supplies are depleted or until we are losing 
money on the deal, whichever is earlier.

    95 cents / one only, with one leg gone / exempt from the 5 figure order 
minimum
    $2.50 Giant Turtles with spikes on their shells / exempt from the 5 
figure order minimum

Notice
These figures were largely made in the late seventies and early eighties.  As 
such, the figures are not consistently "clean" of flash, i.e. excess lead, 
nor do they always have as clearly defined features as the miniatures of 
today.  Additionally, the miniatures described above may already be primed or 
painted with varying degrees of skill.  

I have attempted to identify all uncorrectible defects above.  Among the 
defects which I consider correctable are "flash"; and bends in the figure, 
particularly of a swords, spear, or some other enlongated feature.

Shipping
-------------
Shipping is a flat rate regardless of the size of the order:  $3.20 
domestically, and $5.00 internationally.  All shipping will occur by the 
least expensive (and probably the slowest) means legally possible.

Forms of Payment
---------------------------
We accept cash, VISA, MasterCard, and checks drawn on a United States bank or 
money order (domestic or international).  To prevent us from losing money on 
small purchases, a surcharge of up to $8.00 is necessary if payment occurs 
via international money order.

California Sales Tax
------------------------
We must also charge 8.25% sales tax if we ship to an address in California.

N.B.  The aforementioned telephone number is to my home, not to my business, 
so please be conscious of the time when you call.  If you do not reach me or 
Tita, tell the person answering the telephone that you will immediately call
back and leave a message on the answering machine.  Thanks.

I urge all Tekumel miniatures fans to visit the site:
http://members.xoom.com/minipage/  This site is a miniatures webzine.
Aside from Tekumel, the site is interesting in itself and has some good
sections on modeling and painting, hobby news, etc.  It also keeps a
directory of fantasy rules in and out of print.

I have submitted as additions to the fantasy rules directory: LPT, Missum!,
and Qadardalikoi, along with the six Tekumel army booklets, the Gazetteer,
and the painting guide.  The webmaster has done a good job arranging the
material and even included cover scans of the rules.

The website allows visitors to vote for what they consider the best rules
set, to add reviews of rules, to give general feedback, and to post "hobby
news."  I suppose if someone sent some pics of some nice painted
Tekumel figures, the webmaster might post them.

I urge all of you to visit the site, vote for Qadardalikoi (or some other
Tekumel rules set), add to my initial descriptions of the three rules sets,
post general feedback about Tekumel miniatures, etc.  Miniatures might be
a good "Trojan horse" for getting more people interested in Tekumel. I
posted something to the fantasy forum on the site and got an inquiry from
someone who had never heard of Tekumel before.  He's now planning to
buy Gardsiyal.

Anyway, I hope you'll all take a look and register, in one way or another,
your interest in Tekumel miniatures.

I don't have much more information than that given already elsewhere. As I
recall, the river He'eka runs east-west from Hekellu to the edge of the
desert, then south to Sokatis and thence to Jakalla.

>The major river which runs east from the plains north of Ferinara to

I'll have to check the piece on Chaigari again. I should have a copy of it,
even though I lost most of my early mail in replacing my computer! The term
"Chaigari" is now officially defunct, as the Imperium has formally annexed
the region, and it no longer is a protectorate.   People still call the
region by this name, of course.

The Kanayugara Pass lies south of the Hlaka ruins, through the precipitous
pass just  east of Kakri Midallu Peak. This comes out just north of Fenul.
One of the Emperors (forgot who -- Gyesmu?) had plans to build a stepped
Sakbe road through the pass in order to bring commerce from the northlands.
It did not come off: too remote, and too many more pressing financial
concerns.

The lake at Sirsum is fed by several mountain streams, as well as
subterranean water sources. Sirsum thus has two exits: one west, the other
to the east out of its lake.

The road from Fenul to Hekellu has always had the problem of Salarvyani
interference: raiders from Khum and Koyluga mostly, plus incursions of Ssu.
That is why the road from Sirsum to Fenul was built.

The name "Kanayugara" is derived from a title of the Mountain Demon Qnesh
(Salarvyani Qarqa), surreptitiously worshipped by the illiterate peasants
in the area. He is said to delude and confuse travellers on the slopes of
Kakri Midallu Peak, causing many to slip to their deaths.

Enjoy!

The reason for few "stealth" skills is that we have always had characters
from the middle to upper levels of society. Compare an average middle-class
American/British young man or woman: how often does such a person require
skills like pickpocketing, thievery, assassination, etc.? (Maybe I am
naive!)

Another reason is the strong principle of "noble action" inculcated in
every temple school. One who goes against this risks the opprobium of
his/her temple, clan, friends, and nearly everybody else. There are
"ignoble" people aplenty, but they live on the fringes of society and never
achieve high posts, much less temple recognition (and hence sorcery
skills). The punishments for even minor ignoble acts are so fierce and
terrible that only really twisted individuals would dare to disovey the
social strictures.

This is not to say that "stealth" is totally unneeded. The Omnipotent Azure
Legion, the secret societies, various temple agents, etc. all quietly train
assassins and spies. I think that when I was  working on the original
Tekumel game, I decided not to focus on these strata of society. I had
always found D-n-D's idea of a party made up of magic users, warriors --
plus assassins, thieves, foresters, dwarves, elves, etc. etc. -- to be too
unrealistic. On Tekumel, such heterogeneous parties would be very rare and
would attract instant attention. I thus steered the "game" toward the
centre of society: parties made up of warriors and priests, who are sent
out to perform some mission by the Imperium, a faction, a patron, etc. The
idea of a common thief chatting amiably with a noble of high clan was just
too bizarre. Exceptions exist, but they're rare. Mostly dress and demanour
will identify social classes, and there is a prohibition against casual
mixing.

If you want to introduce "stealth" as a game characteristic, go right
ahead. Your game will then focus around recogniseable organisations: the
O.A.L., secret societies, and the like. Your players will have to obey and
take on missions that further their organisation's goals. If, on the other
hand, you do want to focus upon social outcasts (e.g. thieves in the slums
of Jakalla), you will have a totally different game. Such persons can never
achieve any status in society, and they may die rather quickly and bloodily.

"Noble action" does not prevent ingenious methods of gaining one's ends by
means that are not strictly "noble." Corruption, bribery, political
finagling, etc. are prevalent everywhere. When you buy a beautiful "steel"
sword in the market and later discover that it is made of base metal,
remember that  "buyer beware" is the rule throughout the Five Empires!
Officials routinely demand bribes for things as small as preparing
identification papers, opening gates, letting people in or out, and much
more.

Sincerely,

Phil

The Black Lotus Clan could help your characters with stealthy skills, given 
the proper inducements and letters of introduction.  Err, if things are not 
in order they may quality for the correspondence course.  This is where they 
SEND the assassins to the characters to demostrate thier trade.  The good 
news is there is only one final exam, which normally starts out as a "pop" 
quiz.

Tekumel is so large and diverse, almost anything is possible. I have met a
dozen "Uma's" and related names (e.g. "Umari"). It's hard to remember them
all.

I do have one "Uma" in my cardfile: Uma hiChatura, of the Red Stone clan,
from Paya Gupa, 29 years old, devotee (almost a fanatic) of Lord Vimuhla,
knows a good number of spells and skills. Uma is pretty but not beautiful
(66). She is loyal, reasonably kind, staunch in her beliefs, and very
careful of "noble action."

This sounds like a different Uma. It's a fairly common Tsolyani name.
There are dozens of priestesses of Ketengku in Tsolyanu., and I suppose I
could check the records and see which priest(s) of Ketengku have recently
died in the civil war.

>I don't know just what her name is; it seems like 'Uma,' but that may not be

I get a sense of loneliness and restlessness. She grieves for her husband,
who was so different from her. Her clan has also not been very kind to her.
She covers up by working too hard, and her desire to travel is simply a
replacement for a normal social life. She feels her life is empty and
barren. Her daughter has been taken by her husband's clan and close
relatives, and is almost certainly being educated in a Ketengku school to
become a physician or medical scholar.

She does sound similar to Uma hiChatura (above), but she is the wrong
religion, clan, etc. I shall make a few inquiries and see if I can find the
Uma you want.

Enjoy!

[Moderator's Note:  Kenji Schwarz is looking for updates on a Tsolyani    ]
[                   personality as well.                                  ]

Ngangmuru!

I'm hoping that the collective omniscience of the Blue Room can help me
locate some personages of note who went missing in the excitement of the
last few years.  I'm attempting to track down my fool of a little brother,
Firu Tvosret, but he's a bit shy -- yes, I know, not like the rest of the
family -- and might have gone unnoticed.  

Before the war with Yan Kor broke out he was some sort of strategic
planner at the Palace of War, then got attached, so to speak, to the staff
of General Kaikama hiMrachiyaku.  (How is old "Kaika", by the way?  I
haven't heard from him in years, and wonder how the wars have treated him.
If anyone is in touch, please let him know that I've finally got the money
I owe him, and also still have Squad 4 of "F" Company of the Fifth Cohort
here with me, and thanks for their loan as bodyguards -- they've come in
pretty handy the last few years.  Oh, and Tirrikamu Tsiyohlni and all the
"girls" send their love.)  

Anyway, Lord Ssiyor managed to recruit Firu as an advisor (you all
probably recall that bad business with the papier-mache "Ru'un" around
that time), and the last I heard (this was back in '59) Firu and Lord
Ssiyor were hatching up some cunning plan to fly the entire 25th Medium
from Khirgar to Ke'er in baskets hanging from giant sacks filled with hot
air.  Or in sacks filled with baskets of hot air, or something like that;
I forget the details.  Can I assume that, as with all the little wimp's
schemes, it didn't work out as he and his patron had expected?  

So, my question is, can anyone tell me what's happened to Lord Ssiyor or
Firu, and where they are now?  Fathers and mothers all came here to spend
the civil war in Mletpauk, unfortunately, and they're concerned to know
what's become of their youngest and brightest.

Also, an irritating sharetl from some tedious little plane -- it can be
summoned by the name "schwarz@fas.harvard.edu" -- wants me to ask the
following two questions:

1) Long ago in dispatches from the Blue Room, there was mention of a huge
list of personages contained in something called a "Filemaker Pro
Database", which was at various times said to be coming soon to the
Blueroom nexus point.  I believe a small excerpt from it, listing the
sorry dogs of the White Crystal Clan, did appear, but nothing further.  Is
this ever going to happen, my interplanar familiar wants to know?  I must
admit it would be useful for me, too.

[                   getting a fresh copy.                                   ]

2) Is there any news on the scribal front, to wit, a published version of
_Mitlanyal_, the Jakalla city guidebook, any new grammars or fonts, or the
like?

[Moderator's Note:  George Hammond asks about the events in Livyanu.  I   ]
[                   would like to know how things are going there, too.   ]

Could anyone give a summary of what is known about the plague in Livyanu,
and of the Mu'ugalavyani invasion?  Is the plague one of the known types
of disease (e.g. influenza, or the Mottled Plague, or (shudder) the Plague
of the White Hand), or is it something new?  Is its origin known?  I have
heard rumors that Livyani soldiers brought it back from Tsolei, but this
is mere hearsay.  Has the epidemic spread throughout Livyanu?  What about
Mu'ugalavya or the other Empires?  The Red Hats are said to have reached
at least as far as Tsamra, and if so, they must surely have been much
exposed to contagion. What has been the result?

Regarding those of the Carmine Chapeaux, when did they first cross into
Livyanu, and how has their invasion proceeded since? I've seen brief
mention of their deployment of a network of stones that creates areas of
low/no magical power.  How is the effort proceeding?  Are there any
regions or cities that remain independent of Mu'ugalavyani control?  I
would think that large-scale use of anti-magic would be cause for wariness
and observation by many powers in the other Empires.

I know that these events have been going on for some time, but I haven't
been able to find much information in the Blue Room archive--just a few
oblique references.  Have I missed a source?  

Any help would be welcome, 

George Hammond

p.s. Yes, I do have more than a passing interest <g>.

A good friend, one Chamangesh hiTirrune, sorceror and lay-priest of Hru'u,
is currently stuck on a Qel, cruising south towards Yro with an expedition
headed by the noble Kasi Charash Tlakotani, the most bloodthirsty
Thumis-worshipper it has been Chamangesh's misfortune to know. Chamangesh
is still in awe of the astoundingly improbable mix of savants, sorceror,
and savages aboard the ship.  The steersman is a Haida Pakalani pirate,
armed to the teeth, Kasi Charash has a mute warrior-priest of Gruganu as a
body guard, along with priests of Ketengku, Karakan, Thumis, and a pungent
mix of Ahoggya and Shen (yes, together) mercenaries.  Not to mention a
Jakallani fop, and a mix of Livyani, Tinaliya and Shen refugees we
pickedu up along the way.  
We lost one set of rigging taking on a Red Hat galley four times our size,
and with the winds against us, Yro seems very far.  It would be helpful to
have any news of Livyanu.  We picked up a noble Livyani refugee, one Arkuo
Minaz, and Chamangesh is hoping that he can give us news.  We might try to
make for Foshoa, but not if it's in Red Hat hands.

You can read most of the sorry (<g> in Chamangesh's view) story at
http://www.onelist.com/archive/Mokaltokoi_Tsomun

or you can jump in to the most recent action at
http://www.2d10.com/games_list.html  
(just choose "The Voyage of the Mokaltokoi Tsomun")

[Moderator's Note:  Peter Timko asks about the ancient secrets revolving ]
[                   around the worship of Ksarul.                        ]

I am not an historian of Tekumel, and neither is anyone I know in Tekumel 
(they're  a pretty pragmatic lot). But looking through what histories are 
available has prompted the following line of queries:

The early spread of the worship of Lord Ksarul reached as far as the 
backwater of Haida Pakalla, but there is no particular mention of the 
worship of those gods that revealed themselves to Pavar. So, first, 
would it be the case that the Lord of the Blue Room is more prominent in 
Haida Pakalla than elsewhere. (See Neitzsche's "The Advantages and 
Disadvantages of History for Life for a Terran argument supporting this 
tentative thesis).

Secondly, and this is a longshot, does anyone know (I know, how would 
anyone know such a thing as this) whether the Refulgent Blue Curtain 
Society has adherents there. After all, of what kind of weird "material" 
is the Blue Room composed? Certainly not something that even the Lord of 
Secrets would know how to escape. Not the typical (even for a god) stuff 
of the planes beyond. If you found a key, wouldn't a good place to hide 
it be where no sorcerer could find it?

Really, this is just a way of asking about Haida Pakalla. The Tsolyani I 
know best (I couldn't, in good conscience say "love") is originally from 
that area, and a servant of Ksarul. It makes me wonder.

questing in query,
Peter

Hi.  A quick note.  I am driving to New Orleans today for an all day meeting 
tomorrow.  Some stuff came in the other night, but I won't get around to 
sending it until day after tomorrow.  However, the Tekumel Track for UCon 
did come in, and I have placed it on the ftp site in the main directory.  It
is named 99TekTrack.pdf.   Hope to see folks there!

To guarantee pre-registration, your registration must be postmarked by 11/3/99,
so if you're going, you'll have to hurry.  (Don't try to send anything to me,
use the reg form on the 3rd page of the pdf.

Thanks,
Chris

My message to him went unanswered. I am told that he is rather bitter about
certain fellow officers who did not support his legion when it went up
against the Yan Koryani. As a matter of fact, his legion was mostly
destroyed, and he himself was thought to be dead for awhile.

Lord Ssiyor has joined the Palace of Everglorious War in Tumissa, where he
is writing a treatise on the role of strategems and duplicities in warfare
-- a topic seen as somewhat "ignoble"  by his comrades. No trace of Firu,
however. You may have to and inquire -- or institute a search on your own.

I still have the character file somewhere. We tried keeping it on a
computer in the game room, but in the excitement of the action, we hardly
ever consulted it. It is done on Filemaker Pro 4.0 -- and cannot be opened
any other way. It is also over a megabyte in size, which precludes sending
it out to unsuspecting people with smaller computers! I suppose it could be
put up on the Blue Room with warnings about its size and length of time
needed to download. Chris? [I'll send a zip to you, and maybe Bob could

"Mitlanyal" is in spiral-bound xerox form, as you may already know. Nobody
seems eager to publish a book that big for the gaming market. Bob Alberti
tells me that he is still seeking a fool -- er, publisher...

The Jakalla city guidebook resides with Joe Saul, who always seems to have
a newer and better project to do -- not to blame him; he's just like the
rest of us. Nothing else much new.

Excellent letter. Only the names are rather un-Tsolyani sounding. Probably
Yan Koryani... There are a lot of furriners settled in the Empire these
days after Prince Mirusiya took over as Emperor.
