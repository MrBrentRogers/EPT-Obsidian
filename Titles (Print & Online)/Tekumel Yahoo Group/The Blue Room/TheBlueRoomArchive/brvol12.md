These messages are the accumulation of the messages that were sent out on 
the Blue Room email list between May 1995 and June 2000.  A large portion 
of the information is directly from Professor M.A.R Barker. When the list 
members joined during the time the list was active, they agreed to refrain 
from sharing this data with non list members.  When the list ended, it was 
urged that the data be made available to non-list Tekumel fans, and it 
seemed like a good idea all around.

I only ask that if you download these digests, or have received them in 
some other way, please respect the agreements the list members made, and 
refrain from passing them around and instead point people to the Tekumel 
web site, www.tekumel.com so that they can download them for themselves, 
and see all the other material available on the Tekumel.com web site.

Many Thanks.

That embarrassing episode happened to a new player playing Tekumel for 
the first time at a convention. He had little idea of what would happen, 
and I didn't penalise him overly much -- quickly allowed a much higher 
level mage with the party to revive him. Tekumel can be a dangerous place...

Magic in the role-playing game is much more common and accessible than 
it is on "real" Tekumel. It has to be, in order to keep player-characters 
alive and functioning! For a better idea of the balance, look at the two 
novels.

The Salarvyani font was one of my first attempts with Fontographer. 
It now needs to be gone over and redone -- which I don't have time 
for at the moment!

There are charactes on the lower-case, upper-case, option, and 
option-shift key spaces. There are certainly characters somewhere in 
there for "ts," "ss," "ch," etc. All I can advise is to look at the 
Salarvyani font in the old Zocchi Sourcebook (pp. 132-133) and try!

>>I forgot on my last post to ask, whether Salarvyani, is read, left to right, 
>or
>>right to left, and whether Salarvyani has Initial, Medial, and Final
>>characters. If it does have all three, then Iam going to have to bug Phil
>>for those characters as well.

Salarvyani is written from right to left -- you'll have to use a 
"reversed" font, using a graphic programme (like Aldus Superpaint). 
As I think i have said, I make "reverse' copies of my fonts by 
flipping them horizontally with Fontographer. I type a document left-
to-right and then go into Aldus Superpaint and flip the whole thing 
horizontally. This gives me a neat right-to-left piece!

As for initial, medial, and final -- no, Salarvyani does not have 
these! It *does* have "big" and "little" letters, however. The big 
letters are joined on the line, while the little letters are appended 
as prefixes and suffixes (somewhat like Japanese Hiragana, Katakana, 
and Congi). This makes the font damned near unusable except by the 
Salarvyani themselves, who merrily go along putting up with it!

I hope this helps. One of these days I shall have to write out what 
little I know about Salarvyani. It is a difficult language, and I must 
admit that I don't find it esthetically very pleasing. But... it's 
a difference of opinion that makes horseracing...

Sorry if some of you got this message twice, I stopped transmission to add
one more item...

Hello everyone!  It is another wonderful day for the Blue Room Mailing List.

The Professor has worked very hard and as a result, we have some more new
netbooks.  (BTW, thanks to everyone who has registered Deeds and Engsvan
hla Ganga).  There have been many, but I would like to implore that those
who haven't registered, please do!  If the registrations don't come in, the
flow of new stuff will stop.  (A Note for those who register via the UK
address, please include a small note saying what you've registered, so that
can be passed to me via Snail Mail for book-keeping purposes.)

Enough of that!

I have just put up 3 new Grammars that the Professor has written.  
The first is a grammar of Yan Koryani. Registration Price: $4.00 (US) 16 pages
The second is a grammar of Livyani.    Registration Price: $6.00 (US) 26 pages
And the third, just off the press,
is a grammar of Engsvanyali.           Registration Price: $8.00 (US) 49 pages

If any of you have trouble reading the Acrobat files, make sure that you
downloaded them as BINARY files.  Some FTP clients are not smart enough
to figure out that they are binary files.

Thank you Professor, for all the hard work.  There is only 1 version of
each of these files (trying to escape the 3 different versions we have
used in the past), an Adobe Acrobat PDF file.  You can download the 
Acrobat Reader from the Blue Room Web site, http://nexus.prin.edu or
see http://www.adobe.com/acrobate/readstep.html.

If you can't deal with this new format, get in touch with me and we'll 
explore the possibilities.

I'll get back to processing messages tomorrow (Saturday).

[Moderator's Note:  Bob Alberti offers up his opinion of what you need to run]
[                   a Tekumel Campaign.  This is a reprint of a message he   ]
[                   posted to the newsgroup.                                 ]

What you need to play Tekumel:

1) a game map

2) two ten sided dice

3) the novels 

4) any sort of game book -- from Adventures in Tekumel to the original
Sourcebooks -- in order to get lists of the Temples and their spells, and
maybe the names of some of the most important people just in case you need
to rescue them from certain doom.

5) a lick of common sense

All the other crap -- character stats, encumbrances, combat rules,
etcetera, are the tools of the rules-lawyer, and not worth the attention
of dignified persons.

How to play:

Read any printed material you have -- the novels, gamebooks, etcetera --
to get the basics of the game understood.  To wit, you're playing
characters in a Highly-Stratified, Very Class-Conscious Society.  The fact
that the Gods are demonstrably real, combined with a recorded history some
ten times lengthier than our own, has given the humans on this planet a
unique world-view.  They don't think that they're God's Chosen to Rule the
Universe.  They don't believe that the goal of the individual is to Strive
Eternally for Power, Wealth and Glory.  Instead, they are very conscious
of the importance of fulfilling one's role and one's place.  To the
Tsolyani, Horatio Alger is a crass social climber.

Part of one's role may be unpleasant.  For instance, it is considered
crass for Really High Nobles to know the minutiae of their daily lives. 
How many slaves do they own?  Enough.  How far is it to this other city? 
Depends on my mood, maybe its far or close.  Other examples:  if you're a
priest of Karakan or Ksarul, you may be called upon to conduct a
sacrifice.  This sacrifice may not always be of a grim warrior marching
nobly to the end his role demands:  it may be a screaming, kicking
four-year-old peasant girl crying, "Help, Mommy!  Please, mighty lord,
don't kill me!  I don't want to die!"  Pick up the knife...  If you don't
fulfill your role, you can lose your job and be shunned by all who know
you for your ignoble behavior.

Good and evil are relative here -- if you fulfill your role, you're
"good".  Noble.  If you fail, you're "bad", ignoble.  Killing that little
peasant girl is what society, your family, and your god expect of you. 
Fulfill your role.

These nations have Rigid and Conservative societies.  Any innovation your
players might come up with as "inventions" (i.e. Hey!  Let's invent
gunpowder!") will threaten the already-emplaced element of society which
fulfills that functional role (i.e. The Vimuhla Military Priests, the
agricultural clans responsible for stump-clearing, etcetera).

The Secret Police are everywhere.  The Livyani have the Vru'uneb, the
Mu'ugalavyani have the Mourners in Sable, the Tsolyani have the Omnipotent
Azure Legion, and the Temples all have their own agents.  Spies are
everywhere.  Your players may themselves be assigned to spy on the party
by their superiors.  Because of this high degree of monitoring, overt
violence (especially temple vs. temple violence which would violate the
Concordat, the nonconflict agreement between the temples and enforced by
the Empire) is Caught and Punished.  Unless your clan is rich, punishment
is usually Impalement.  If your rich clan saves your hide, they may not be
very happy with you.  However, the Concordat does not hold in the
wilderness or underground, so watch your back in those places.

Clan is everything.  Clans are your family.  Families raise the children
mutually in a shared living-space or clanhouse.  You can visit other
cities and stay with your clansmen there, even if they've never heard of
you.  As long as your papers show you're a clanmember in good standing you
will be housed in the dormitories or private rooms (if you're important),
fed, and protected to some degree.  But if you piss off your clan they can
withdraw their support -- if they kick you out of the clan, you're
"Nakome", clanless.  If that happens, forget it.  Someone could find you
in a dark alley, slit your throat, and nobody would care.

Your loyalty is usually to your immediate family (spouse and kids), clan,
temple and nation, but these can all vary.  

The Emperor owns everything.  If a representative of the Omnipotent Azure
Legion (OAL) says "Give me that, in the name of the Empire", you better
give it and smile.  Later you can get your clan or temple to register a
complaint and take things "through channels", but when it's you versus the
OAL, the OAL wins.

Okay, so you have a map, so you know where you are.  You have dice to
resolve any questions (01-10 good, 90-00 bad, use common sense).  You know
that you operate within a web of interdependent forces -- you want THIS,
but your wife wants THAT, but your clan wants THIS OTHER THING and your
temple wants SOMETHING ELSE ENTIRELY.  Meanwhile the Empire has made it
clear that nobody should even try ANY OF THAT.  Your Temple comes to you
and says "We want SOMETHING ELSE ENTIRELY.  If you go get it for us, we'll
promote you, reward you, and give you title to some land over here.  If
you don't, well, there's a position in the Swamps of Purdimal waiting to
be filled..."  

What do you do next?

Another repost
-----

>One thing
>I have learned while playing in the world of Tekumel is that being alive
>is probably a crime.

I hope I can correct your perception of the Tsolyani.  They are NOT, by
and large, possessed of "inherent bloodlust", nor of the opinion that
"being alive is a crime."

The legal system in the Empire is strict, but it is not Pol Pot. 
Punishment is harsh, but it is only meted out when warranted.  If Tsolyani
citizens, even nakome, feared for their lives upon stepping out into the
street, commerce and industry could not be maintained.

The reason Tsolyanu may LOOK "bloodthirsty" at first glance is probably
because the nature of role-playing games is to place characters into
"nonconforming" situations.  Few people enjoy role-playing peasants,
administrators or guards going about their daily routine (well, few people
do -- we actually tried it for a while and it was a refreshing change from
saving the world).  Bickering about where to dig the latrines, who should
dig them, and whether they should be close to the river or farther up the
hill simply doesn't make for fun gaming.

So players tend to be engage in questionable, if not outright illegal
activities.  In Tsolyanu raiding a tomb is highly illegal, and will in
addition annoy the tomb-robbing clans, the tomb guards (whose bribes from
the tomb-robbing clans will be interrupted if the tombs are disturbed by
outsiders), and the posterty of those in the tombs.  But how many basic
Tsolyani adventures are set in the Underworld?  A lot!

Another factor in this perception is "place".  The Tsolyani expect people
to perform their roles, and frown upon nonconformity.  But what is the
adventurer but a nonconformist?  You're supposed to join the clan
business, marry the girl-next-door, and produce little ones who scurry
about the clanhouse -- what are you doing wandering around in those grimy
tsuru'um with a bunch of ignoble scum from other temples!?

So the adventurer in Tsolyanu is automatically in conflict with the whole
society.  If you disagree with society long enough you will be at first
urged to cease your conflicting activities, then punished, and finally
done away with if your nonconformity persists.

But, really, the "average Tsolyani" is just as peaceable and kindly as you
or I. The average Tsolyani is perfectly happy to marry the girls or boys next
door, to fulfill their role in the clan or temple, to seek acceptable
measures of gain and advancement which bring respect and reward, and to
avoid the attention of the Imperial legal system.

For contrast, look around you.  Our "adventurers" rob banks, or run drugs,
or slay people who have insulted their honor -- we call them criminals. 
After three drug offenses we imprison them forever.  However, if they slay
someone, we release them in about seven or eight years as long as they can
show the least provocation.  A Tsolyani would think our system arbitrary
and insane, and would find our madness confirmed in the crime which
riddles our cities.  Are we "bloodthirsty"?  How many people will die to
violence on fictional TV programs tonight?  Is it a crime to be alive? 
How many poor, minorities, or immigrants are hassled, harassed, illegally
arrested or imprisoned?  If our minority population can be considered
"nakome" for a moment, what is their ratio of rates of imprisonment?

No, from the point-of-view of the "average Tsolyani" life is about doing
your job, pleasing your friends, family and bosses, looking forwards to
the spring celebrations and the autumn harvests, and trying to enjoy your
brief stay upon the planet.  And in many ways their society is more sane
and stable then our own.  Or do you really think the Western way-of-life
is going to be largely the same as it is now in the year 21996?

[Moderator's Note:  New listmember Mike Parrish asks about the Keys and    ]
[                   Wards protecting the Blue Room.  Note: Professor, I    ]

[                   sorry if the last post was a repeat, I just think it   ]
[                   has some excellent advice in it.                       ]

>"Three of these keys are known now: one is in the High Temple of Ksarul

>not known."

>KEYS and WARDS:
>1> What form do these keys take?

The "keys" are of several different shapes, as crafted by each of the 
ten deities who set them in place. The best description I have is of 
the key in the possession of the Ksarul priest (from whom, rumour says, 
it has now been stolen by much higher powers). This key is about eleven 
inches long, made of dark blue metal. It looks rather like a screwdriver: 
a bulbous "handle" from which a round shaft extends out to a "blade" 
made up of complex planes, angles, and surfaces, all about an inch in 
diametre. The handle has tiny glyphs running in bands down its length. 
These are said to be in one of the tongues of the Great Ancients (or
the Latter Times?) and are quite unreadable today. The key in the temple 
of Ksarul is one of their greatest treasures, and no one is permitted to 
see it. What the key held by the Ssu looks like I cannot say: if you are 
foolhardy enough to try to get it, go right ahead! The other keys are 
"said" to be of various shapes and may not be instantly recogniseable 
as "keys": boxes, plaques, coins or medallions, etc. They will be 
perceived as having great power by  any high mage, however, even if he 
cannot further identify them.

>2> What types of actions are/were required to activate them.

It is said that when the 2 "Wards" for each key have been found and 
brought together, they will cause a nexus point to appear that leads 
directly through to the relevant "wall." The holder of the "key" must 
then know which wall it is and also the correct words and rituals to 
be performed. Then he will insert the key into an aperture in the 
wall before him and perform the "unlocking"; this is apparently a 
series of motions and rituals that are different for each key. If 
successful, the wall will "open" -- perhaps a door through it, or 
perhaps it will disappear, no one knows. When all ten of the keys 
have been successfully used, and all the walls are open, the priests 
of Lord Ksarul claim that he will then awake and "walk forth to take 
his place upon the throne of all the worlds."

The rituals needed to use each ward and key are said to be inscribed 
upon tablets in ten "central" places on each of the inhabited worlds. 
On Tekumel,these are supposed to be Avanthar, the Unstraightened City, 
the Isle of Eyes, the temple in the centre of the Valley of the Seven 
Moons, the treasury of the House of Eyloa the Sorcerer, the Ice Temple 
beyond the Rim of White, the Hall of the Mightiest of the Hokun, the 
secret temple of Lord Vimuhla in the Chakas (and the hidden "pocket 
plane" that lies beyond it), the House of the First Founder (wherever 
and whatever that may be), and one more that is not known. These tablets 
contain the rituals for all of the ten keys and their wards, but these 
can only be read and used by mages devoted to the particular deity who 
rules each individual key and its wards. 
 
>3> Have all three been activated?

No, only one has.

[Moderator's Note:  Whoah!  First time I have heard this.  Care to elaborate?]
[                   Which one, who did it? And what happened after he did?   ]
[                   Also, could you fill us in on the details of who stole   ]
[                   the key from the young Ksarul Priest, and who he is?     ]
[                   Well, you elaborated on the story below.  Any more       ]
[                   details, juicy tidbits, etc?                             ]

>4> Are there rumors regarding the placements of the other 7 keys?

There are more rumours than you can shake a stick at! In fact, if you 
look about downtown Jakalla, you can find vendors who will cheerfully 
sell you all of the ten keys for a few Kaitars. They usually have a 
complete stock of these, plus the wards to go with them -- and they can 
direct you to pottery makers who have casts of the tablets for sale 
as well. (If they were in new York City, they would also have the deed 
to the Brooklyn Bridge... Buyer beware!)
 
>5> What is known to have guarded those found?

I cannot speak for the key in the temple of Ksarul because it was found 
and placed there long ago. There were some very serious demons guarding 
the key discovered by the priest, which were overcome by a mixture of 
stealth and heroism. Other keys have been rumoured over the years, and 
in each case the guardians have been extremely powerful and intelligent 
beings.
 
>WALLS:

>Presumably, at least one of the keys has been activated (used). 

We *think* the key belonging to Lord Thumis was indeed used successfully. 
This is the story, anyhow. The gate it opened led through to the Hall of 
the Twelve Doors, behind which permanent nexus points led into the 
Paradises of each of the Gods (plus 2 of the so-called Pariah Deities -- 
but not the third and most inimical!).

>1> Has there been any noticable change in the world as a result?

No. It will take all of the keys to bring about the freedom of the 
Blue Lord.
 
>2> Has Ksarul stirred in his slumber? Right, Who'd know?

Not that anyone has seen or reported. As you say, "Who'd know?"

>3> From a mechanical view, since the other 9 needed the help of the One
>Other, and thus his wall, to imprison Ksarul, if one of the keys were
>used, would it imply that the blue room was losing integrity? Would this
>process accelerate with the use of additional keys? Just asking for the
>going viewpoint on this one.

The priests of the temple of Ksarul claim that the Doomed Prince is 
indeed aware of the opening of each wall and eagrly awaits his 
freedom -- and revenge upon those who abandoned him and then imprisoned
him. All of this is "high doctrine" within the Inner Temple (and is 
probably also mirrored by other opinions and theories within the other 
temples). The average high priest, mage, scholar, etc. has no more idea 
of this than I have of the mysteries of quantum theory!
 
>The ROOM itself:

>1> In the Book of Ebon Bindings (I believe), there is mention of one or
>more antechanbers to the Blue Room. What are they?

Just what they imply: some sort of outer chambers, said to be filled 
with treaures, guardians, and -- a few sources claim -- sleeping 
followers sent into exile along with the Blue Lord. 

>2> What populates the antechamber(s)?

As just mentioned above. The guardians (also called "servitors") are 
of many forms and powers. The sleeping followers are similarly a mix 
of human and nonhuman. It is said that these cannot awaken until their 
master does. 
 
>3> Can one more clearly commmunicate with Ksarul from these locations?

Apparently not. The Temple of Ksarul claims it can communicate even 
with his sleeping mind because of his might and power.

>I've had an interest in the Ksarul mythos since I first played EPT in
>the late 70's early 80's. My first character was a priest of
>Ksarul(mage), and one of the first firgures I painted was for this

Good luck in finding another game. Stay with the Blue Room, however, 
and we'll strive to keep you busy!

[                   fessor's response.                                     ]

Does a Demon of the Dark have a mother? A mother-in-law? Ugh..  I don't 
want to contemplate it! But the answer has several dimensions (and I am 
not making a pun). Some of the races (e.g. the Aerial Ones, the 
Voyagers of the Farther Isles, etc.) do indeed have social structures, 
families, cities, and other things on the planes where they dwell. They 
are *not* like human families of course but rather more like the sort 
of "families" one finds for snakes, birds, and the like. They "nest," 
procreate, eat, drink, etc. -- all in terms of their own strange, 
non-human societies. They are not just "humans in funny suits" with a 
few extra powers. They are as alien and unintelligible as a bolt of 
summer lightning, and they cannot be "visited" or even approached by 
humans who do not follow the age-old methods and rituals. No mage, to 
my recollection, has ever succeeded in exchanging a single word with 
any of these other-planar species, nor is one advised to try! Lord 
Sarku's undead legions are closer to our understanding than are Lord 
Thumis' "Mighty Ones of the Pearl Mists." 

In reply to your question, thus, there are indeed some demon races 
(and I prefer the term "Sharetlyal" since "demon" to an American or 
European implies some sort of theological content that is really 
absent in the Tsolyani view) that have social structures and dwellings, 
wives and kiddies. Other inhabitants of the Planes Beyond are *not* 
family-minded, however. They tend to be the "great demons" (the 
"Sharetldalisayal"), such as Lord Origob, Lord Gereshma'a, and the 
like. These seem to have cleaned out all opposition on their own planes 
(and within their own realms, in the cases of really powerful beings) 
and now dwell solo for much longer than humanity has existed.  They 
may have comrades and fellow-citizens somewhere, but I am sure I don't 
know where. (Lord Gereshma'a is said to have taken on human form and 
amused himself with a human woman for some time. He'll probably tire 
of her soon, and then he'll go on to some other hobby.)

>If a party were to travel to Jneksha's 13th plane for example, would the 
>Blazing warriors be fighting the flying serpents of conflagration?

No -- as far as I know. These races dwell on different sub-planes. 
I also suspect that their goals and interests differ, so that they 
may not see each other as adversaries at all.

>Or would they be working together to kick in some Demons of the dark from 
>another plane? 

I doubt this. Only if their ultimate master so commanded. This would 
then violate the sort of "Concordat" that seems to exist between the 
Sharetlyal races.

>Can demons and their races travel the planes freely?  In 
>short do we know anything of what goes on 'out there'?

I suspect the Sharetlyal can indeed move between the planes -- but 
only *certain* planes that belong to their "realm."

>Perhaps some mighty sorcerer can regale us with tales of their 
>visitations to other planes to see if we can build up a picture from 
>these experiences.

This is where those who have played in Tekumel campaigns over the 
years can really help. I can't recall how many times players have 
encountered various races of Sharetlyal and had some interesting 
experiences that I have not written down.

So enjoy and let me know what you need. I'll try to fill it in.

Regards,

[                   of the drawings that accompany it (and after I edit).  ]

>First a couple about the Ghatoni (I'm thinking of taking a party of

You are quite right. The glottalised stops have become weakened and 
in some Ghatoni dialects are no more than aspirated voiceless stops 
([p'] -- a [p] + breath -- as in English "pin," "pot"), contrasting 
with unaspirated voiceless stops ([p] as in "spin," "spot"). The 
latter have become voiced stops (e.g. [b] as in "bin") over the 
millennia. More remote, "mountain" dialects maintain the glottalised 
series intact. On the coast, east of the Tsupil Tlasha Peaks, there 
is at least one rural dialect that has a glottalised series 
contrasting with *both* unaspirated voiceless and voiced stop 
series! Try /p'etr/ "link (of a chain," versus  /petr/ "root," and 
/betr/ "obsidian."

>that both P'jjenaa and N'lu"ss have these glottalized stops, and that 
>P'jjenaa has palatalization and labialization of most consonants, is this 
>also a feature of N'luss? One of the chieftains mentioned was named G'yudr-
>is this supposed to represent a palatalized voiced velar ejective,

Yes, right on most counts. The transcription "G'yudr" does not 
represent a glottalised voiced velar stop, however, but was the 
only way I had of showing a contrast between glottalised /k'/ 
versus an unaspirated /k/ *followed* by a glottal stop: /k-'/: 
/k-'yudr/. The gentleman in question would be quite incensed if 
you pronounced his name as /k'yudr/ (with a glottalised /k'/, since 
this denotes "glob (usually of Hmelu or Hma dung)".  
[That will get you on his good side, won't it?  :)]

Indeed it will. The Ghatoni deities are fairly unineteresting, 
anthropologically speaking, but they will be included.

(And are there any other deities worshipped by the descendants of the Dragon 
Warriors?)

None that I know of.

>In the Zocchi sourcebook you refer to the dress of the Ghatoni as
>"several layers of complex garments" and I was wondering if you could 
>perhaps give a bit more detail on typical Ghaton dress.

Rather intricate tunics or vests over long-sleeved shirt-like 
garments. They wear kilts (and don't ask me what a Ghatoni wears 
underneath his kilt!) of patterned, Hma-wool or in the summer 
Firya-cloth. These are decorated with appliqued images of their 
gods, lightning bolts, magical symbols supposed to protect them 
in battle, and the like. They wear round-crowned felt-like hats, 
sometimes with crests of feathers or with ear pieces. Two "legions" 
are listed for them in the "Armies of Tekumel" series, vol. 2, 
Yan Kor: "The Fangs of Drake'el" and "The Band of Slashers," but I 
don't think there is a picture of any of them there.

>(I'm assuming that 
>Ghatoni women, given their status as little more than property, wear 
>little more than slaves elsewhere).

I.e. practically nothing. In the cold weather, they are often 
allowed to wear long, shapeless robes (like ponchos).

Usually on their faces, although painted designs on their fur are not 
unusual.

That's a big order. Check out the FTP site for new Yan Koryani, Livyani, 
and Engsvanyali grammars. I'll try to get around to more later.

Engsvanyali at your fingertips! Bednalljan is a Salarvyani-like 
language and is much more difficult. I may get around to it in 
a while.

I have already answered others with similar queries. I never intended 
for players or Tekumel afficionados to try to master the non-human 
tongues. They are meant to be unintelligible -- otherwise some of the 
mystique of those races disappears, and they become just like other 
human nations. I think my replies are on the Blue Room; perhaps Chris

Thank you! Some have made attempts to set up tables or lists of 
modifications for the Pe Choi, but I don't recall anybody doing 
it for the Shen -- and certainly not for the Ahoggya. Roll up a 
rude, discourteous beer-barrel, and you practially have an Ahoggya!

Patience, again! I'll get around to some of these. The Pygmy Folk 
character in "Flamesong" should give you an idea of what they are 
like. The Ahoggya in "Man of Gold" was nasty enough, and I may 
introduce some others in further writings.

[Moderator's Note:  Listmember Lisa Leutheuser asks about Lisutl root and its]
[                   use on Tekumel.                                          ]

I'll try to answer Lisa's questions, although I would prefer that some 
Tsolyani woman with more experience do so.

>How frequently does a women have to chew lisutl root?
>(Off and on throughout the day?  Once a day, e.g. in the morning after 
>waking up?  Other?)

I am told that a piece about as big as a woman's thumb once a day is 
what is needed. The juice tastes rather like very mild peppermint. 
It must be swallowed and digested, so I would assume that this 
implies that some time must pass before it takes effect.

>Is it possible to overdose on the root?  If so, what are the symptoms
>and any harmful effects?

No harm is done that I have ever heard of. The stuff seems to work, 
no matter how much extra you might consume. Too little, on the other 
hand, and conception may occur.

>How long before the drug in the root begins to be effective?
>(same/first day of use?  After the first week/month/X-amount-of-time 
>of continuous use?)

I think -- and I'm only guessing -- that a day in advance should be 
long enough, although many women chew the stuff on a regular daily 
basis. Better safe than fertilised! The drug is a made-up hybrid, 
created long ago when humankind first got out to the stars. It's been 
in use ever since, and now it is grown in practically every clanhouse 
back-garden in the Five Empires. It seems to have originated on one of 
the Pe Choi worlds.

>How long before the drug wears off and the ex-user can become pregnant?

This varies. I have heard times from a day later to a week later -- 
probably differs from user to user, depending on her system.

Better Lisutl root than the Shen custom of eating those of their own 
young who are slower or less cuddly than the rest...

An Ahoggya's weight? I don't recall ever giving this information, nor 
do I really know how to calculate it. We've calculated all sorts of 
data for the nonhuman races, but this is one feature that I think 
has escaped me.  Ahoggya are comparatively short and squat, but they 
are indeed very dense and heavy. I'd guess at about 300 lbs. for a 
fairly large specimen. Pe Choi are lighter, though tall. I'd suggest 
perhaps 200 lbs. for a male and 160-180 lbs. for a female.

Anybody want to try persuading an Ahoggya to sit in the pan of a 
merchant's weighing scale?

[Mod.  Not ME!]

[My thought.                                                               ]
[I thought Ahoggya were pretty dense (so to speak) and were quite weighty. ]

Sounds about right.

Hmm.

No. According to local legend, this was the "first human" on Tekumel, 
back when the Ssu were friendly and curious about space visitors. His 
"house" is, of course, destroyed and long gone. Some claim to have 
seen its "ghost" -- and also to have met the ghosts of his two (many 
generations removed) descendants, who still dwell there, cursed forever 
by the Ssu, whose world was taken from them by the invaders who followed 
the First Founder. All of this is *legend,* and no reliance can be 
placed in it.

As with many legends, that of Dormoron Plain seems to ignore historical 
problems, such as when and how these deities -- or whoever -- performed 
these actions. They are now *thought* to be the same deities as those 
of Pavar's pantheon, and that's what the epics say. But who knows, 
really? Many Khishan languages contain morphemes marking a 
"mythological tense" of the verb: i.e. the action took place in 
legendary times and is thus outside or beyond the usual, simple 
progression from past to present to future that one finds in English 
and other Terran tongues. This is the tense used for Dormoron Plain.

The story is told from several points of view, even within modern 
Tsolyani culture. The Mu'ugalavyani recension of the Lament to the 
Wheel of Black has portions that are denied by the temple of Ksarul's 
version, and vice-versa. The Livyani tell the story as though it were 
pure fiction -- and "foreign" at that, since it does not contain or 
relate to their own pantheon of Shadow Gods.
 
>Another question I have relates to the topology of the demon planes.
>Tsolyani savants often talk of planes, realms, dimensions, and
>sub-dimensions. What distinguishes these concepts from one another?

Some of these terms are near-synonyms. Others are concepts of 
"rulership" (e.g. "realms"): Certain powerful beings are said to 
"rule" in a certain set of planes; these are their "realms." "Planes" 
and "dimensions," on the other hand, possibly reflect a translation 
problem. There are indeed sub-terms for "sub-dimensions," "major 
planes," "minor planes, etc. etc. in Tsolyani and other languages, 
but these seem to differ from period to period, temple "school" to 
temple "school," and even writer to writer. The whole system may be 
just a scholarly attmept to bring order into a place where it really 
doesn't exist in human terms. ???

>sub-dimensions simple dimensions with a limited number of connecting
>dimensions - or is there something else in play here? Are realms
>"bundles" of planes/dimensions? Are these conceptual aggregations or
>meant to denote specific topological features of the Planes Beyond?

As just noted, these terms possibly overlap, although "realm" seems 
to refer to groups of planes occupied, ruled, or whatever, by one 
being or "race" (this term is suspicious) of Sharetlyal.

>It appears that the language of the Book of Ebon Bindings is a
>simplification of higher-dimensional topology - but how can we sharpen
>the conceptual framework to explain these various terms? I have a few
>questions that could help us clarify this admittedly recondite lore...

I cannot clarify this much. Tekumelani scholars are as obstreperous 
as Terran scholars in talking about such difficult concepts. I don't 
know that these matters can be neatly defined, clarified, or explained.

>Here is the first question: Do the Engsvanyali Gods possess multiple
>points of presence (MPOP) capability? (Like a Yog-Sothoth god/being in

>"at the same time"? (I know the physicists will kill me for using this
>pre-Special Relativity concept at all...but I have to get the idea
>across)

According to the Temple of Vimuhla, He is manifest in every fire, 
in every spark, in every blaze. This is doctrine. On a more 
"theological" level, I am told that He can indeed manifest Himself 
at any time, place, etc. He wishes across the multiverse. The priests 
say that if a worshipper in Bey Su beseeches Him to manifest His 
Flame at the same time that a worshipper in Jakalla requests
the same aid, the God can and will do so -- if it be His will.

>Or are the Gods bound by causal laws that they obey (either
>through necessaity of respect) that precludes MPOP behavior? This would
>seem a necessity -- since Ksarul was able to be "bound" at Dormoron
>Plane - and imprisoned.  

Not necessarily. You are speaking of the Gods as though they were 
necessarily bound by human laws ands logic. This is a fallacy common 
amongst mediaeval Christians, Muslims, and Jews as well: lay God out 
on a dissecting table and *tell* Him what He can and cannot do, as 
did the Islamic "rationalists," the Mu'tazili scholars of the Middle 
Ages. Various mystics and other schools rejected this excessively 
"Greek-philosophy/Aristotelian-logical" view. The "binding" of Lord 
Ksarul is a "god-thing" -- not something like jailing a human felon!

Nice speculation! I doubt that this is a problem to Tekumelani savants --
any more than Christians have a problem with Jesus' resurrection. One 
might ask the same of those who claim that the Virgin Mary "appears" 
in many different manifestations all across the world: if she appears 
in Mexico, how can she also appear the same time in Florida, etc.?

>Another question, how do sidereal dimensions figure into the topology?

>"missing the metaphor"??!

The Tekumeani have indeed asked such questions, but they reply in 
terms that would be more intelligible to a Hindu scholar, rather 
than to "logical" Western thought. I recall well the problems we at 
the University of Minnesota had in persuading the University's 
Department of Philosophy to accept Hindu philosophy as "Philosophy," 
rather than as "legend" or just "religion." Some of my then-colleagues 
were even less kind, calling it "superstition" or "nonsense." What 
these same philosophers think of Christianity I cannot say ...

You're welcome to use any metaphor you wish. The Tekumelani do come 
in a mutliplicity of shades of opinion! A few may talk about one 
reality, with all other "side dimensions" ("branches") as being 
"shadow worlds," but most priests speak of the Gods as being powerful 
enough to move freely from one plane (or group of planes) to others 
at will. The "branches" of the Tree of Time are thus considered "real," 
although there is an additional concept of "centrality" to the main 
dimension (the "trunk" of the Tree). One old Hnalla priest described 
this as being like a prince who had his main palace in Bey Su, but 
summer palaces in every other city in the Empire.  The latter were 
smaller, more ephemeral, likely to be used or disused at the 
pleasure of the master.

Who knows, really? The history of Dlash has not yet been written. It is 
another topic that I prefer to reserve for my future fiction-writing. 
You propose a parallel with Avanthar; you are indeed partially correct. 
Dlash, Avanthar, and the Unstraightened City are all axes for 
interplanar lines of force. Dlash, however, is a conduit for very 
powerful energy perhaps emanating from some central plane where She Who 
Cannot Be Named dwells...

>Also, what clans are said to reside within the Sealed City of Dlash? Do

>Mu'ugalavyani invasion of course!)

No idea, really. Commerce with Dlash indeed exists, but it is with 
the *outer* city that surrounds the *inner* city. There is a wide 
ring of shops, warehouses, factories, etc. all around the inner, 
walled area where no outsider is ever allowed. That's about all I 
can say at this time.

[Moderator's Note:  Brion Oliver asks the following about Military Priests  ]
[                   and their temple ranks.                                 ]

>Regarding military priests (which I understand to most typically be assigned 
>to the Temple Guard), do these individuals advance circles as do other 
>priests throughout their careers? Or is their advancement strictly along the 
>military rankings?

Perhaps I misstated things somewhere about "military priests." There 
are two categories that must be distinguished: "temple guard units" 
and "military sorcerer priests" who serve in the magic-using units 
assigned by certain temples to Imperial legions

The former are mostly just soldiers:  individuals who have a little 
priestly training and a lot of soldierly expertise. These are 
assigned to guard temples, escort priestly caravans and entourages, 
protect temple property (both in the temples and elsewhere), and 
generally serve as "palace guards" for the religious institutions 
to which they belong. These people have ranks very similar to regular 
soldiers and are structured as "legions." Most Imperial army troops 
do not consider "temple legions" as good as regular units, although 
this is not true in all cases, certainly. 

>I remember reading somewhere (that I cannot now find) that military priests 
>are required to attain at least the 1st Circle of Priesthood, but cannot 
>find mention of advancement as priests after that. I am also aware of the 
>social status comparison table in section 2.430 of Swords & Glory, which 
>compares military rank to minimum Circle equivalents, and wonder whether a 
>Kasi in the Temple Guard would need to be at least 7th Circle in their 
>Temple's Priesthood as well, or if that table is meant solely for social 
>status comparisons as its title suggests.

Temple guards need not rise in priestly rank in order to become 
officers of their units. A temple guard unit does tend to be *led* 
by "regular" priests, however: the Kerdu (general), the two 
Dritlanyal, and the two Molkaryal ("colonels" and "majors," if 
you like) are most often administrative or ritual priests in the 
temple. A lower officer (e.g. Kasi -- "captain") may never rise 
higher than that rank unless he is talented, rich, or otherwise 
favoured by the administrators of his temple. Some temple guard 
officers do continue to study priestly skills in their spare time 
-- of which they do not have much -- and eventually go on to "rise 
from the ranks" to higher offcer posts, or else go on to become 
"regular" priests (ritual, administrative, etc.) in the hierarchy.

The second group of "military priests" consists of the sorcerers 
who belong to the magic-using contingent fielded by a temple or 
legion. These people are usually full-fledged sorcerer-priests. 
They may have begun as ritual or administrative priests, or as 
regular scholars, but for various reasons, they gravitated away 
from these roles and went into the very specialised magical 
contingent. Some of these may feel that they lack the talent or 
interest to go on to higher levels as academicians; others enjoy 
soldiering and the outdoor life but do not want to give up their 
priestly pre-requisites and become "regular troops"; still others 
actually thrive on developing their group military spells and 
working with comrades in combat situations. Being a "sorcerer-
military-priest" is not easy. It involves long hours of group 
practice and hard work, plus all the perils of battle -- and being 
a target for incoming enemy sorcery! Such priests cannot go off 
adventuring because of time and training constraints; they have to 
obey orders (like them or not), and they are often the first ones 
to be sacrificed if captured. I thus have discouraged players from 
taking on these roles, although some indeed might find them 
interesting for short periods.  These people have regular priestly 
ranks and pre-requisites and are *not* considered to be soldiers in 
any sense. They may retire from this sub-profession and go back to 
being ritual or administrative priests. Sometimes they can return
to one or another scholarly profession, too, although this is less 
common. The temples prefer to employ retired military sorcerer 
priests in ritual or administrative roles, feeling, perhaps, that 
they are temperamentally no longer suited to the "ivory-tower" 
scholasticism of the temple schools and academies.

Phil

[Moderator's Note:  Apparently, a marathon gaming session went on in England ]
[                   a couple of weeks ago.  Here is the description of the   ]
[                   event by Jack Bramah.                                    ]

Here's a brief description of the events of our weekend session
as viewed by Donmikayel hiGangasa (i.e. me). Dermot (Ref) said he 
would send in his own version some time this week, which might be 
an interesting change in views.

"If only I'd never met Pathiqeng, maybe none of this would have
happened, and I'd be at home now, enjoying the company of my wives and
concubines.

I thought it was just a simple party invitation, to Pathiqeng's memorial
orgy, and who am I to turn down such an invitation, especially when an
Imperial Princess is going to be present.

It was splendid affair, with all the glitterati of Pala Jakalla present.
Kurshetl and I paid a brief visit to the House of the Fulfilment of
Dreams before attending, but we mainly discussed business.

The entertainments were unbelievable, concluding with a most impressive
illusion of Pathiqeng conjured up by one Abasudaste (one of Mai'n's
maidens), when it all started to go suddenly wrong. A great cloud of
noxious vapours began to seethe up from the centre of the stage, and a
tentacled mostrosity appeared within the middle of it and began to
devour Abasudaste. Needless to say, panic ensued, and I didn't see much
else as I made sure that the Princess got away safely. She may have been
expecting trouble, as she seemed to have posted several discreetly armed
men among the guests.

I had nightmares that night, which not even Tsuhoridu could quench. Next
morning my delivery of Tumissan mash-fruits had not arrived. Shayusaq
had promised me the previous night that they would be here the following
morning.

As I was preparing myself to visit Shayusaq at he Clan of Sea Blue, I
received a cordial breakfast invitation from Kurshetl. In the middle of
this pleasant meal a major-domo burst into the room, shaking with
fright. It seems that Shayusaq had come back to the clanhouse the
previous evening with two girls, and they had gone to his chambers. The
major-domo had just discovered the mangled bodies of the two women, in
Shayusaq's chambers, and no sign of Shayusaq. We calmed the man down and
told him we would deal with it. We summoned Zorel hiSsyeti from the OAL,
a man of infinite discretion, and told him of the situation, and that we
felt that it was most definitely not in keeping with Shayusaq's
character to have committed such a heinous crime. He admitted to us that
it seemed that several other people had been framed for murders
resulting from the disaster at the party.

After Zorel had gone, Kurshetl asked me if I was interested in joining a
group of people he was assembling at the behest of the Princess to
investigate the events of the previous evening - she was particularly
keen, it seems, to avoid involving officialdom.

Our little group comprised several of my old comrades in arms, and some
new faces: Dzin (a Livyani girl), Mazaholza hiNiriuna (Sapphire Kirtle
clan), Zorel, Kurshetl and a priest of Gruganu called  (by himself)
Fulat of the Black Fingers. I suspected him of being a scribe, but
Kurshetl seemed very deferential to him (most unlike him). We also took
several bodyguards with us.

Somehow we were led to a slate quarry - a huge pit in the ground with a
spiral track wide enough for a chlen-cart going down to the bottom. As
we observed from the lip of the quarry three men came out from a cave-
mouth pursued by several soldiers in brown robes. I recognized Shayusaq
and another former comrade Murugani, and there was a man I seem to recall
seeing at the party the previous evening.

The more impetuous of us started to slide down the side of the quarry,
some falling and injuring themselves, whilst the more careful of us used
the (long) cart-track. The brown-robes also had a sorceror, since
Kurshetl started to fly down the side of the quarry, but it seems his
enchantment was dispelled and he fell a fair distance, breaking his leg.
By the time I reached the bottom the brown-robes had retreated into the
cave, and Kurshetl had patched up his leg. He cast a great cloud of
poisonous vapour into the cave mouth and we followed in afterwards.
Unfortunately his gas appeared to have done very little except kill
quite large number of Hu-bats.

We split into two groups, one to go down the main cavern, and one to
explore a narrower side passage. The narrow passage contained nothing
but captive mine-workers, whom we released, and very grateful they were
too.

We rejoined the others to find that some of them had gone down a narrow
tunnel which looked almost as though it had been melted out of the rock.
We followed after dispatching two vile Mrur.

As we passed down the tunnel we saw a strange amber glow emanating from
ahead, and as the first of us burst into the cavern at the end, they
discovered to their cost that the floor was covered in Sarku's hideous
Worms of Death. In the cavern were two Sarku priests and two crossbowmen
off to one side, while in the middle, at a glowing altar a man (who I am
told was Vridekka) was beginning some unspeakable ritual over a teenage
boy.

Their magical defences were too strong for us to act quickly, and we
were unable to stop Vridekka from plunging a knife into the boy's chest
and pulling the still-beating heart out. He next took out a copper ewer,
and poured the glowing liquid it contained into the chest cavity of the
victim. Terror seized us as we believed that we only had seconds before
some unspeakable demon-lord would appear. In Shayusaq (who had died and
been reanimated by our enemies started to advance on Vridekka, who
suddenly realized that our magic had managed to dispel his defences, and
he called forth a nexus point and jumped through. Kurshetl conjured up a
patch of Food of the Ssu around the altar but it did not consume the
body of the victim, who suddenly got up and crouched on the altar facing
us, his face eerily lit by the glow from below him. As one of our
warriors pushed him backwards off the altar into the vile vegetation, we
caught a glimpse if what appeared to be an Imperial Seal around the
boy's neck.

Kurshetl and I advanced across the room to end the boy's suffering, and
I struck with my sword into the purple fronds and struck hard, though I
thought I felt whatever it was I hit moving into the nexus gate.

We would have followed, but Kurshetl and Fulat have almost exhausted
their magical energies. Kurshetl said that the gate is stable for the
forseeable future, and so we will return to Pala Jakalla to prepare
ourselves better, and return here when our mages have had a chance to
rest"

This is a moot point.  I assume the question is, "does the rope break?"
The REAL question, when you think about it, is "do the Ahoggya and Pe 
Choi live or die?"  This answer can be easily obtained by having the 
Ahoggya leap out onto the rope and rolling to see if the rope breaks.

If the rope breaks the Ahoggya dies in the fall, and the Pe Choi
dies head-down in a vat of boiling water, with the scent of melted 
lemon-butter wafting through the barracks of the Sarku guards.

It has to be this way, because the Ahoggya always goes first, because 
there is nobody, nowhere, crazy enough to voluntarily get UNDER an 
Ahoggya...

[Moderator's Note:  Brett Slocum adds something to the discussion of weight ]
[                   of Non-Humans.  His discussion of weight rises from the ]
[                   the rule system he is using, so use it if it fits your  ]
[                   system.                                                 ]

I can help here.  I converted the nonhumans of Tekumel to GURPS.

GURPS bases the initial height on Strength and then modifies it 
by a random die roll.  The height is then used to find the weight,
also with a randomizer.  So for instance, a human of average ST of 10
starts at 5' 9" (5' 6" on Tekumel), modified up or down by up to 
six inches.  Let's say he ends up 5' 8".  Then you look at the base 
weight for 5' 8" and find 145 lbs., then modify it by up to 40 lbs. 
less or  50 lbs. more.

In my conversions of nonhumans to GURPS, I generated the following 
heights and weights for nonhumans: 

Ahoggya: 10" shorter and 100 lbs. heavier than a human of equivalent 
Strength.

Hlaka: 10 inches shorter and 10 lbs. lighter.
Pe Choi: 5" taller and 10 lbs. lighter.
Shen: 15" taller and 30 lbs. heavier.
I'll have to look up the others later.

So, if you take an average ST Ahoggya (ST 13), you get a base height
of 5' 2" (6' minus 10"). This gives a base weight of 220 lbs. (120 + 
100 lbs.).  YMMV.

The Blasphemous Accelerators are no longer a powerful group within 
the Five Empires. They still exist in the Unstraightened City north 
of far easatern Salarvya, and they do have training facilities in 
the city of Onchash Chairan on the Southern Continent. They do not 
recruit aqnywhere else, and they do not accept converts from other 
nations or groups, saying that the trainee must have been brought 
up in the traditions of their order from birth. 

>As a postscript, are they still recruiting?  How would you go about joining

They are still working to defeat their foes, but this is all far 
away and somewhat irrelevant to the Five Empires.

[Moderator's Note:  Mike Parrish has some more questions on the Keys and ]
[                   Wards that guard the Doomed Prince.                  ]
Dear Mike,
 
>More Keys and Wards Questions:
>1> What form do the wards take? Specifically, what form were the wards
>of the Thumis Key?

As far as I know, the Wards may be of any shape. They are about a foot 
long and of various thicknesses and colours. They are often made to 
look like other objects: e.g. a sphere, a delicate dagger, a complex-
appearing tool, a rather heavy thing that resembles a crooked wrench, 
a statue (of someone or something now unrecogniseable), etc. The Wards 
for the Thumis Key were said to resemble a little silver butterfly and 
a longish crystal claw. Once used, their main purpose was apparently 
over, but they still have immense magical powers.

>2> You mentioned that the wards must be brought together to form a nexus
>point to the given wall. Are these wards obviously two parts of the
>whole, or are the dissimilar items?

They may have no apparent relation to one another. The mage who uses 
them must know what they are and how to use them, together with the 
tablet inscription that operates them.

>3> Is it possible to destroy any of the keys and/or wards? 
>I wouldn't think so...

The Keys and Wards are indestructible, at least by any method known 
to humankind.
 
>Would it be possible to take one interdimensionally, or hide it in a
>pocket universe?
>Might be real bad for the Blue Dude.

Yes, they can be transported just like other objects. But those who 
know -- the Watchers and the Sentinels -- will know where they are. 
They cannot be completely destroyed since one complete set of all 
of the Wards and Keys must exist on every one of the Planes of the 
Gods. As far as I know, however, a Ward or Key from one Plane cannot 
be used together with a Ward or Key from another.

>4> In the _Book of Ebon Bindings_ the antechambers are mentioned (I
>can't recall the exact text, and I'm at work) as a place where
>unsuspecting meddlers in demon affairs would be transported to and dealt
>with severely (is there any other way?) by the guardians in the
>antechamber. This seems to imply that at least some of the guardians are
>at least somewhat awake. Is this so? Maybe a midnight snack?

The Guardians are indeed awake and aware. Lord Ksarul was permitted 
to have certain unsleeping, undying, indestructible attendants to 
care for him during his aeons-long imprisonment. The Guardians do 
deal harshly indeed with hostile visitors.

>5> Regarding the inscribed tablets in the central places:
>Are reliable copies available in temple libraries?

No, unfortunately. I don't know of any library that has usable copies, 
although I am not familiar with all of the secret libraries of Lords 
Qon, Thumis, or Ksarul himself. I rather doubt that there are any 
copies that are easily available.

>The pottery makers with their casts, are these reliable? 
>If so, are they available in all 10 varieties?

Absolutely not. These copies are just trash, for sale to tourists only 
-- which is why I mentioned the Brooklyn Bridge. In the United States, 
we always joke that any really obvious scam is "like selling the 
Brooklyn Bridge" to a naive tourist. Apologies if I used a metaphor 
that was not intelligible to all!

>6> Regarding the wall that went down:
>Is there anything different about the person who did the deed?

According to some public records, the user of the Key was unharmed 
and returned to normal life. Others say that he was "taken up," 
however and given a place of honour in Lord Ksarul's personal paradise.

>Seems like the Big Guy himself might be pretty pleased with him, but I
>can imagine the temple hierarchy finding _something_ to be upset about.
>Maybe a usupring of authority?

Exactly right. If he had stayed openly where he was, it is almost certain 
that one or another power would have "offed" him by now.

>7> What happened to the key and wards that were used?
>You mentioned that the process of opening the wall could be reversed, it
>might seem to be upper on most Ksarul fans that this _not_ happen.

The Key and its Wards disappeared into Lord Ksarul's personal plane. 
If the process were reversed, you can be sure the forces of the 
Blue Lord would have been outraged, to put it very mildly.

The Ahogyya is not really a tall creature: 1.41 to 1.60 m in height. I 
think they have been portrayed as bigger than they really are. I don't 
see the weight given as being unrealistic. They are indeed ferocious 
and make up for their size by sheer nastiness.

[Moderator's Note: Mark Bee asks about Ditlana.  Great question, and Great  ]
[                  answer!                                                  ]


>I understand the basis principals of Ditlana but I don't quite understand how
>an entire city!? can be torn down and rebuilt? 

The custom of Ditlana is *supposed* to work like this: the Imperium 
decides that a certain city is ready for the process. Imperial 
engineers and administrators approach the city governor and arrange 
with the temples and other institutions to protect important sites, 
particularly those that are underground. The populace is then given 
so many weeks or months to go visit clan-relatives, set up temporary 
quarters outside the city, or make other arrangements. Stores and 
goods are moved by cart, with the cooperation of the transport clans 
and the Imperial government. When the time comes, the army is given 
the task of clearing out the last residents, looters, and others still 
in the city. Then the work crews begin the task of destruction down to 
ground level, filling in foundations, and levelling older buildings. 
This may not be done all at once, especially in the case of large 
cities, and some parts may still be inhabited while others undergo 
Ditlana. Whenever an area is cleared, the Imperium works with the 
owning clans, temples, etc. to plan new buildings and replace and 
renew the section. The whole process is hideously expensive and may 
take several years (but so did the Egyptian Great Pyramid). Sometimes 
it is not completed for a whole city, and some older areas may be 
spared, standing side by side with newer edifices. The planners are 
supposed to make transport and communication easier, set up livable 
housing, etc. This is not always successful. Some cities, moreover, 
resist and refuse to allow Ditlana to be performed: e.g. old Khirgar, 
which has persistently blocked all political pressures to begin 
Ditlana. Sometimes many hundreds of years may pass before Ditlana 
is achieved. At times only the major buildings of the "city centre" 
are replaced, while older suburbs go untouched. At other times, only 
the slums and degenerating sections of a city are rebuilt, while the 
wealthier clans and the priests manage to save their property unharmed. 

It's all largely political -- and rather inefficient. It does seem 
to work eventually, however, and most of Tsolyanu's major cities 
have indeed been wholly or partially renewed over the past two 
millennia. This is not applied to Mu'ugalavyani or Livyani cities, 
of course, although the Red Hats do make a practice of simply 
calling in the army to level older, degenerating urban areas.

>What is left behind?

The filled in areas of a city are rebuilt according to plans agreed 
on in advance by the owning clans, temples, businesses, and the 
Imperial government. Buildings thus go up almost as rapidly as they 
go down. The process does save underground shrines and ancient 
catacombs, often building new access tunnels to make them available. 
The Cities of the Dead are not rebuilt or destroyed.

>Does the

>it stay in roughly the same place?

The city stays in the same place -- or at least close by.

>What happens to the city of the dead
>outside of so many Tsolyani (and other nations of the five empires)? Are they
>also rebuilt or moved?

No, as said above.

The system does not always work; it is subject to political pressures 
and the needs of the times. For example, the current civil war has 
precluded all attempts to get the central sections of Jakalla to 
agree to Ditlana. The same is true of Mrelu and Purdimal -- which 
have always resisted being "Ditlana-fied."

One needs to see Ditlana at work in order to understand all of the 
problems and processes it involves.

Phil

[                   ving warehouses in cities.                               ]

Most clans hire poorer clan members to serve as guards, overseers, 
caravan masters, etc. This is true of the great warehouses and 
grain-storage silos. Poorer clansmen may be given quarters, some 
money, and other goods in exchange for overseeing these facilities. 
Younger clansmen are employed as guards, escorts, labourers, and 
the like. Various clans (e.g. the Tlakotani) prefer that all physical 
labour be done by slaves or members of allied lower clans; others 
claim that it is good for younger clansmen to work hard and get 
training in the realities of life. 

Nobody would trust the Jakallan police to protect property! Bribes 
and "gifts" work to some extent, but if one turned a warehouse over 
to the police, it is almost certain that some very assiduous and 
clever "transfer of property" would immediately ensue.

"Trust a clansman; see your property again," as the old adage says.

[Moderator's Note:  Paul Roser asks about some other languages.             ]

>Now that I'm thinking about these things, would you pass along this brief

>the grammars for Thu'usa and the Tongue of the Priests of Ksarul? 

I've thought about these languges a lot. Thu'usa never seemed very 
important to me since it is of such limited usage. The Secret Tongue 
of the Priests of Ksarul is another matter, but they prefer that I 
not reveal their secrets to the world -- even this world. The script 
also defies my talents with Fontographer: see p. 60 of the Zocchi 
Sourcebook! 

>I've

Similar, yes, but different.

>As for the Tongue of the Priests of Ksarul, I have imagined something like

A phonemic alphabet, plus a large corpus of ideographs, plus symbols 
of grammatical elements -- ! Very complex, and perhaps undoable on a 
computer. I will have to look into it.

>I was

>mistaken?).

I think all of these letters are there somewhere. Try lower case, 
upper case, option, and option-shift keyboards. If you have a 
character display programme such as "PopChar" or "Big Caps," you 
may be able to see all of the symbols on your keyboard at once. Use 
the Zocchi Sourcebook, p. 133, to see what these particular letters 
are supposed to look like. (It is also easily possible that I omitted 
them -- it's been known to happen...!)

>Also Sunuz is truly somehow suggestive of something dark and

When Chris gets the Sunuz grammar up on the FTP site, you will learn 
all about these matters. Sunuz really doesn't have a short "o" but 
does have a long vowel sound close to it (mostly borrowed from Duru'ob 
or Engsvanyali, but occurring in various indigenous morphemes as well). 
The Sunuz long vowel sounds something like the back low rounded vowel 
of "awe." The pattern is rather skewed.

Look for the Sunuz article on the FTP site. You'll enjoy it, I think!

[Moderator's Note:  Dermot Bolton sends another view of the UK gaming session.]

Chris,

Here is an account of the first day of our weekend Tekumel bash.  David
Bailey GM'd this bit and I did the next day on another plane (I blame the
beer  :)  ).  The other plane being where Vridekka scuttled off to.  Fulat
is not a high Lord like Don Mikoyal hiGangasa but a mere 5th circle priest
of Gruganu of the Black Mountain clan, hardly important at all really...

Dermot
-----------

An encoded report from Pala Jakalla to Hmakuyal. - Dohala 2366

Lord Fulat bearer of the Azure Scarab, wielder of the Black Claw, bears 
tidings of my mission to the south to my brethren of the clan.  As 
predicted brothers the matter arising in the south has been of great 
political importance, my castings and those of Lord Charek hiViridame 
were true.  I was right in entrusting this mission to no one but myself 
so great is its significance.

I arrived in Pala Jakalla (PJ) some two ago and established myself within
the temple of Gruganu as a 5th circle scholar doing research, the
librarian here is perceptive and paid deference to me which made me
suspicious, so I had him promoted.  I believe Penom has welcomed the
experience of their new senior librarian.  I contacted our two senior
members in PJ before contacting brother Kurshetl hiSsanmirren our main
field operative in these parts.  As a senior member of Sea Blue, second
cousin to the old Chancellor, OAL operative and high scholar at the
temple of Ksarul he is well placed, and luckily for him - loyal.  The look
of surprise shone right through his silver mask when I signalled him of my
position, I do not believe his major domo had ever heard him stutter
before.  I told him that events would become 'interesting' to the clan
very soon and to wait for my orders.

A day later a notice was posted outside the governors palace - a
declaration.  In short it was a challenge to the Emperor from an
unspecified Imperial heir.  Ma'in the exquisite had made her move at last
- the south being the only area she could do so with safety. 

A event in honour of a departed local savant of the Green Lady of
thrusting hips was announced.  Apparently this 'Pathiqueng' had something
of a well deserved reputation, a phallic green sculpture now overlooks PJ
from a nearby hill in his memory.  See report &*$% - <->
(un-translatable) for more details.  Princess Ma'in and co. would be
attending as would local dignitaries.  I had my slave scribe volunteer to
write out invitations, this to find out the guest list and get a certain
5th circle priest of th e Black Mountain clan a invitation to the party
too.  The disturbing thing about the guest list was the addition of one
'Motai hiMotem' an unknown man with no discernible background - and a
close friend of the princess it seemed.

The party was in full swing when Ma'in's albino, Abasudaste, gave a show
of illusion in honour of Pathiqueng.  Something was wrong when worms
appeared in the tableau, the Scarab embedded in my chest began to tingle
as the sorcerous presence grew.  People started screaming as hideous
mouths began to devour and liquefy the woman, my first action was to
quickly cast a powerful disenchantment to banish the summoning.  It only
slowed it for a second as I realised this was something much more than
mere Worms of Death.  A marine kasi near me heroically grabbed a K'aing
standard from a wall and charged the monstrosity - impaling the spear tip
through its furred and tusked head.  A 'Lan' if totally futile effort. 
Panic still prevailed as I realised the nature of the beast - ASHONU,
Steward of Lord Gereshma'a.  As I realised the implication of such a
demonic summoning Kurshetl dispatched the creature with a simple spell of
nutrifaction thereby satisfying the creatures appetite and sending it on
its way home back to the 36th circle.  A clever trick that I must commend
him for. 

Ma'in had left the melee with this Motai character, after the melee I
followed them in stealth and listened in to their conversation in an
nearby room.  Motai had dropped his own illusion and revealed himself to
be a strange crystalline creature with a voice like that of gently
breaking glass.  Not a Hokun, but perhaps a Churstalli of legend?  I
distracted a soldier advancing to the room with a thrown pebble long
enough to hear mention of possible retribution by 'her brother' and the
suspected involvement of Vridekka.

Vridekka, the reason I had to come.  The reason we had to act swiftly in
this matter yet with discretion, I only wish it had not been him.  For
reasons obvious to our policy we need Ma'in safe, HE (the emperor) cannot
be allowed to interfere, but it still puzzles me why Vridekka has done
this.  I had my suspicions even then that he may have gone 'rogue'. 

A party was gathered to attend the problem of Vridekka who was thought to
be near to PJ.  Some of the guests had gone missing after the party
including the marine kasi and a kasi (an agent of Mirusiya) from Red
Devastation.  Also a cousin of Kurshetl called Shyusak had vanished after
being implicated in a double murder.  (NB: I took the opportunity to
blackmail the major domo of Sea Blue about the murders, another useful
informant gained).  It seemed that Vridekka had some well placed agents.

I allowed the search party to follow the trail to an abandoned quarry NE
of town where I discreetly joined them.  We arrived only to see the three
missing men being pursued by some worm soldiers, a melee ensued.  I evened
the odds somewhat by causing the food of the Ssu to appear at the feet of
the soldiers.  There is something satisfying in hearing the terrible
screams of a panicked enemy being dissolved in corrosive juices. 
Meanwhile Kurshetl flew in from above only to be brought down by their
sorcerer .  Some slid down the scree others ran on the path to engage the
enemy.  They retreated down the tunnel only to be followed by Vapours of
Death from my wounded ally Kurshetl.

The group rallied in the tunnel only to be stumped by the lack of
torchlight, the vapours having extinguished all sources.  I proceeded up
the narrow passage, having a knack of seeing in the dark, while they
discussed a plan.  Two Mrur were quite responsive after some minor magics
and I took a torch back down to the group.  The noble lords gathered below
(see attached list of names) had a remarkable talent at procrastination,
so once again I took the lead down the main tunnel.  A few minutes down a
new tunnel, as if dug by a giant worm, appeared of the main one. 
Standing within was a brown robed man and two crossbowmen.  They attacked
but my warding stopped the bolts and I smiled as the sorcerers spell had
no effect on me.  I attempted to send the sorcerer into the Labyrinth of
Elongated Shadows before erecting a magical ward to prevent the rest of
the party from being 'hebetated' as was attempted on me.  The enemy ran
off as I waited for my comrades.

I realised that the mage needed to be eliminated so I offered to provide
magical assistance to two brave warriors who could go on ahead.  I made
Shyusak and Murugani (Red Dev) unseen and unheard so as to assist pursuit. 
They ran into the darkness with my self a bit behind them, the party
followed noisily behind me.  A cloak left by Murugani alerted me to the
laddered shaft unseen ahead, I descended warily only to encounter a
terrible scene indeed.

Ahead of me was a chamber, a man making a sacrifice at an altar, my
comrades fighting some Mrur and some other brown robed priests assisting
the ceremony.  I advanced only to be savagely bitten by a carpet of worms
- I leaped back out of the room.  I realised that the ceremony needed to
be stopped at all costs so killing the victim would be the swiftest course
of action.  As I once again summoned up the noxious food of the Ssu there
came an amber glow from around the altar scene, not only had I failed to
breach the magical protection but I had given vital energies to my foe! 
Curse his vile sorceries!  I felt like an acolyte for such an error, I
should have realised the presence of a Bulwark of Amber.  By this point
the rest had arrived.  With my pedthetl weakened I dispelled the bulwark,
and then disenchanted the worms with another mighty spell.  Our warriors
advanced, already Vridekka had cut out the beating heart of the boy
sacrifice and was pouring an amber fluid from a copper ewer into the chest
cavity.  Kurshetl tried in vain to slay the emperor's mage as he quickly
opened up a nexus point to escape our attack.  The boy arose from the
altar smiling eerily before being overwhelmed by the hideous vegetation of
the Ssu, only to crawl through the portal badly burned.  The last thing we
saw of the boy was an imperial seal around his neck - Dhichune's son!

We knew not where the portal led and we were too drained to discover
where, so we retired to PJ before setting off after the pair.  Kurshetl
urged me to assist him in summoning The Beast Without a Tail to pursue
Vridekka.  As attractive as the idea was I had to veto it, as discussed
the clan could not afford to show our direct influence in this matter. 
Instead, upon discerning the benign nature of the other world, the party
was rallied to pursue the duo through the nexus.

They departed yesterday, I remained to find out more of Ma'in and her
Churstalli.  What exactly she is planning and how to turn the knowledge to
our advantage.  I know not of the fate of our allies in the planes
beyond.

Glory to the one true prince who resides within the blue room.

[Moderator's Note:  Someone mentioned to the Professor that he might write ]
[                   a bit about the lack of common maps on Tekumel.        ]

I'd like to clear up a commonly misunderstood feature of Tsolyani 
culture.

I refer to the lack of *maps* in the Five Empires. There just aren't 
any.  When guiding someone through a city or countryside, words are 
used instead of "maps."  This is considered "noble" since the person 
guided may "take it ill" to be considered like a child for whom 
pictures must be drawn!  The Tsolyani thus measure buildings, fields, 
and other mappable items and write out descriptions in terms of units 
of measurement. 

There are a couple of exceptions: merchants and other travellers may
use a diagrammatic sort of "map": a series of boxes for cities 
connected by lines representing roads, with notations in writing to 
show difficult terrain, etc. These are rather similar to Arab maps of 
the Middle Ages. The "roads" are not in proportion, nor are the city 
boxes "sized" to show big versus small cities. A note in the margin or 
scribbbled all around the box may explain some of this.

Box-diagrammes are used by soldiers, too, for strategic and tactical 
troop movements and arrangements. These usually show units as simple 
boxes, with arrows and other devices to indicate movement. Written 
notations around the margins give orders to units to stand, advance, 
fire, and the like.

A Tsolyani who wants to "see" a city can have an artist draw or 
paint a "picture" like that given on the box cover of the original 
EPT. Nothing is to scale, large figures of stereotypical merchants, 
priests, etc. are shown in areas where they are relevant. Palaces 
and fortifications are depicted much larger than real size, and 
sites of historical or cultural importance may be given a separate 
little inset picture showing salient features. These pictures are 
rather map-like but are different.

Architects may also use box-diagrammes for plans, but these are 
always supplemented by words -- and sometimes by pictures of the 
building when it is finished. Important officials (e.g. city 
governors) may also possess 3-dimensional clay, wood, etc. models 
of their domains. Again, there is little attention to scale. (The 
map of Jakalla that was published with the first EPT takes only a 
rough stab at a scale: it is thus really a "Tsolyani" map. Temples 
and palaces are shown very large, while sections of the city filled 
with lower-class housing and the like are small and undetailed. 
Even this is more than any real Tsolyani might attempt, however -- 
it was just my own way of showing Jakalla and at the same time 
keeping it sort of "Tsolyani" in atmosphere.

None of the other modern peoples and races of Tekumel seem to have 
maps either, although it is said that the Hokun may have something 
like them, and the Naqsai peoples of the regions southeast of 
Livyanu on  The Southern Continent do have more detailed systems of 
symbols for their box-diagrammes.

The Great Ancients did have maps, of course. Those written on paper 
or other materials have long since perished. They also produced High 
Cartography "map-stones": gemstones or interesting rocks that were 
technologically (magically?) imbued with data about the place 
represented, rather like a CD-ROM disc. One could pick up a map-stone 
and "feel" the contours of the land, see mental pictures of the people, 
events, etc., all interspersed with spoken and written text. 
Unfortunately, the languages in which these map-stones "speak" are now 
millennia-old and quite incomprehensible to modern Tekumelani, even 
with magical aid. Many stones have "faded," moreover, making their 
pictures and messages hard to see or hear.

Regards,

Phil

Greetings everyone!  Hope those of us in the States enjoyed the Holiday
on Thursday.  

Good News Strikes again!!!

We have released another Net Book as of today.  I have uploaded a Grammar 
of Sunuz, the language of the Pariah Deity worshippers.  The article is 
long, about 60 pages, and shareware reg is $12.  

In thinking about registrations, I was wanting to make sure that everyone
who has sent in a registration, has been acknowledged.  So, I will be 
posting a mailing to everyone a list of people who have sent in 
registrations.  If your name is not on the list and you have paid, 
please contact me immediately, as I did move in the midst of all this and 
might have lost something.  If you have your cancelled check, send me a 
photocopy of both sides.  I'm pretty meticulous about money details, so 
I don't think I have made any errors.  However, I don't have that much 
confidence in the Post Office. :)

That said, on Monday, I am leaving for vacation.  I mean really leaving.  
No phone, no beeper, etc.  I will be out of communications for the whole 
week.  Don't expect any activity.  I'll try to get out a few dribs and 
drabs that I already have before I go.  I have worked over a lot of the 
material on the ftp site today, and many of the multi-format documents 
have been replaced by a single pdf file now.  If you have any problems
with the new pdfs, make sure you download them in binary format.  Also,
I have bumped the revision number of Deeds to 2, as I added a tidbit at
the very end that the Professor provided: details of a new legion.

On the Net Book front, this is the end of new material.  Please make sure 
you register everything you download.  This is the only way we will see 
any more new Tekumel stuff.  

The Professor and I have been brainstorming on ideas for new material.  
I didn't mention to him that I had this idea, but I think I'll run a 
little poll.  What do YOU want to see about Tekumel next?  Please keep
your requests realistic.  I don't think the Prof will write a detailed
history of the Dragon Warriors period or on the Latter Times, as there 
is so little left from the period, etc.

Now, back to reprinting material.  As you know I have been working on re-
printing the Source Book.  I have what was the 3rd part of the Source Book
completely scanned (the part that was never reprinted by TOME/White Dwarf) 
and will be editing and modifying the master document while on vacation.  
I hope to have it finished soon.  I am releasing Part 3 first, as it has
not been published since the Zocchi Sourcebook printing.  I will then modify
the master docs for the other 2 parts.  (I have already hand edited them.)  
They will follow.  I will leave each part as a separate entity, and combine 
them all together as a single volume.  I am doing it this way to accomodate 
anyone who has purchased vol 1, or vol 2 singly, or both as a set, or none 
of them at all.  It seems to me to be the easiest way.

I have had only one reported problem with the new PDF files, so I am going
to assume that all goes well on that front.  If you have a problem, let me
know. As I said before, you must download them in binary format.  I am
providing printed copies for those who have problems with the PDF format.  
Ask me for details.

One other geographic note, we have 146 members now.  I just added members
from two new countries, Belgium and Italy.  Our members come from the fol-
lowing countries.  USA, United Kingdom, Finland, New Zealand, Australia,
Japan, Sweden, Germany, Canada, Belgium, and Italy.  Pretty impressive 
group!  :)

Well, that's it for now.  Please place a subject like "Poll Response" on 
your messages that are suggestions for new material.  Please send any
regular questions for the list separately.

    are likely to be as many formats as there are stars in the
    sky.  I am enclosing 2 utilities for converting binhex on 
    Intel platforms.  I have not tested the 2 utils, use them
    at your own risk.

This is the readme of the Fonts directory.

Hi. This is a group of fonts from the Professor that he uses to
    write Tekumelani Languages.  All fonts are in 2 forms.  A truetype
    font for Windows, and an font suitcase for Mac (binhexed).  I will
    list the fonts once, the truetype is the .ttf extension, and the mac
    suitcase is the .hqx extension. 
Note:  The non reversed Tsolyani and Livyani fonts have to be typed
       backwards.

Truetype Fonts    

    Livyani   --  A Livyani font.  A non-reversed version.
    RLivyani  --  Another Livyani font, that you must reverse to 
                  get the true right to left reading.  You can 
                  reverse the font using a graphics program like 
                  Photoshop.
    RTsolyan  --  A reverse Tsolyani font, that is used like the
                  above mentioned Livyani font.  There is a sep-
                  arate font for the Tsolyani Numbers.
    RTsolNum  --  Reverse Tsolyani Numbers.
    Salarvya  --  A font for Salarvyani.
    Sunuz     --  A font for Sunuz.
    Usenanu   --  A font for Tsolyani that is not reversed.
    YanKor    --  A font for Yan Kor.

Postscript Fonts

    All fonts that end in ps.hqx are Postscript fonts of the 
    stated variety.  They are binhexed, and if you have a unix
    or PC platform, I can provide you with a utility that will
    decode the files.

Note for Engsvan hla Ganga...  Each flavor is a bit different, due to 
MS-Word's inablility to cross platforms identically.  We changed all the 
fonts to a standard Times New Roman, but still Mac Word 6 and PC Word 6 
paginated, broke columns, etc differently on each platform.   I will be 
converting Engsvan hla Ganga to PDF very soon.

Many, but not most, Tsolyani buildings have deep foundations and 
cellars. Most have superstructures of stone, brick, etc. These 
superstructures often have very thick walls that can provide a huge 
amount of worked stone blocks and rubble. In addition, earth is moved 
in by cart to fill up some excavations, and a concrete-like material 
(I am not sure of the technical name) is used to fill parts.  Engin-
eering is not my field, so you will have to ask the construction 
experts how they would go about filling a destroyed building exca-
vation in the midst of a city (e.g. downtown New York or Chicago). 
I know *what* is done -- but not always *how* it is done.

Clanhouse walls can be quite thick and of good, dressed stone or 
brick. Ancient cellars are often used and reused, over and over, 
with new tunnels built to lead down to them. Stone, earth, and clay 
are brought to the site, also, by cart and barge. Brick and stone 
slums that have proliferated over the centuries often form the rubble 
core of new buildings. There is a lot of dislocation and upset when 
people are moved about in this way, but it has to be done, and so it is.

Not a very detailed answer -- but I am no engineer.

[Moderator's Note:  Lisa Leutheuser asks about "incentives" for promotion,  ]
[                   exactly who to present them to.                         ]

>I've read that one might use bribes...ah, I mean, gifts in order
>to advance in one's temple.  To whom does one give the gift?
>Does it go to the "temple" or to a specific person in the temple?
>Who handles circle advancement and assignments of offices/titles?
>Would this be one's immediate superior or someone higher up?

The answer depends on the purpose of the "gift" and the personnel 
involved. In some cases, one senses that a certain person is the 
"key" to getting a promotion or permission or whatever it is one 
wants. A "giver" has to assess the "giftee" properly and make sure 
that the gift is appropriate -- no use giving an ascetic, 80-year-old 
scholar a book of Engsvanyali pornographic verse (unless the scholar
has indicated that this would indeed by desired!). One person might 
be offended by gold, while a different person would gladly accept it.

Where there is a clear case of reluctance to admit to greed, one 
should piously state that the gift is "for the temple." The recipient 
can then say with equal sanctimony, "Of course, for the temple" -- and 
pocket it. In some delicate cases a gift has to be planned for months 
and may involve many steps: e.g. I recall one case where the recipient 
was utterly honest, simple, and likely to scream for the O.A.L. if the 
word "bribe" were mentioned. The giver found out that the recipient's 
father had been cashiered from the Imperial army years before, and 
the family had had to live with that disgrace, which affected their 
daughters' chances of good marriages. The giver had friends high up in 
the Palace of Glorious War in Bey Su and was able to drop a judicious 
hint that he could intervene on the father's behalf. This was quite 
improper, but a little pressure here and a push there, and the father's 
memory was almost magically cleared of blame -- indeed, he received a 
posthumous citation -- and the giver arranged to be the one who brought 
the happy news to the recipient. The recipient provided the giver with 
the desired promotion out of gratitude! (Sadly, though, the father's 
enemies learned of the matter and managed to have the citation, etc. 
revoked.

All this means is that one must be careful in offering bribes 
(gifts). Usually these need be no more than a coin or two. Player 
characters often give way too much -- I've seen doormen and 
chamberlains get 5 Kaitars for just letting a person pass from one 
antechamber into another! A Hlash would do for many lower-rank 
officials, while a Kaitar might be offered to a higher officer from 
whom one needed a favour. Bigger bribes for bigger and better 
favours, of course. It might cost thousands to get the title to a 
fief, especially if it were a good one that was wanted by several 
other claimants.

>My character has recently purchased a very fine "gift" and is 
>wondering who to give it to in her temple for the best results.

It depends on the favour wanted and the person controlling it. Is 
the favour a public one that is not the responsibility of any one 
person:  e.g. a promotion? Or is it something that a certain 
individual controls: e.g access to a certain library or book? Or 
an object kept by certain caretakers: e.g. a temple treasure? Or a 
grant or permission that comes through a temple society or synod?
Or what? Pick the responsible person(s) judiciously and assess just 
what it is that these people could want. Then arrange for them to 
get it -- and for them to know clearly that you are responsible for 
them getting it -- but not responsible enough that you can be accused 
publicly of bribery or subverting the faith or such-like when your 
(or their) enemies find out!

The smoother the giving, the smoother the result. Or, as the Tsolyani 
say, "The raucous Qasu-bird is driven away with stones; the gentle 
Kaika-bird offers eggs and is beloved."

Regards,

Phil

Harsan took his two pretty wives and went off (quickly!) on a 
mission to Livyanu. He's there now -- and the sub-protagonist 
of the third novel, which is a slow one for me to write for a 
multitude of reasons. But I'll get to it one of these days!

[Moderator's Note:  Adam Levine and Fred Kiesche write about maps and     ]
[                   specifically, High Cartography.                       ]

[Adam's Questions]

It is true that a very, very few scholars still have some capabiltiies 
of making High Cartography-style mapstones. These do not have the 
permanent magical qualities of the ancient ones, but a skilled "reader" 
can get something from them. One feels them, touches the ridges and 
whorls, and "interprets" the code -- if the scholar knows it. If the 
encoder has employed another tradition, of course, it cannot be read. 
The original mapstones required no special knowledge to "read": their 
messages appeared telepathically in the heads of those who handled them.

[Fred's Questions]

>Regarding Maps, my feeble brain seems to recall a very abstract map 
>used in "Man of Gold"--perhaps at the Temple of Thumis somewhere in 
>the beginning of the book?

I think you are referring either to the language sculpture (which was 
a series of agreed-upon symbolic representations of linguistic 
structures), or perhaps to the High cartography mapstones. I may have 
forgotten, though.

[Moderator's Note:  Well, I seem to remember the OAL officer that came     ]

Maps are for the Tekumelani just like the wheel for the Aztecs and 
Maya: they had wheeled toys but noboy ever thought to put larger wheels 
on a box and make it carry things!

[Moderator's Note:  Scott Kellogg asks about Meshqu colorations and John  ]
[                   Bailey makes a suggestion.                            ]

[           fire up again sometime next weekend.  See you guys later!     ]

As far as I know, the Meshqu plaques do not have a fixed colour coding. 
This is indeed odd, since the temples do have specific colouirs, as do 
the astrological values of the colours of Tekumel's sister planets and 
the two moons. I suspect the Meshqu plaques go more on the visual 
symbolism of the *design* of the plaques than their colours. These 
symbolic patterns go back to the Engsvanyali period, at least.

Since the various deities have associated colours, I suspect that moods 
based on colours cannot function: if Hru'u is always purple, does this 
mean that all worshippers of Hru'u exist in a permanent "mood indigo?" 
Are all Sarku worshippers is a perpetual "brown study?" These sects 
claim that their deities' hues are particularly apt and lovely, and 
that Belkhanu's bright yellow and Avanthe's sky blue are garish and 
"too brilliant to be tasteful."

[Moderator's Note:  AGH!  Said entrepreneur can run his own financing! ]

Yes, by all means, go ahead any make up a set of pretty Meshqu plaques! 
We could also do them up to fit various Terran contexts. College 
dormitory residents might find them useful: "I am studying: come back 
in an hour!" or "My significant other is away this weekend; come on in 
if you are (choose which sex) and interested!" Or" "I failed the exam; 
enter at your own risk!" Or: "I'm in the mood for a game of bridge; call 
me if you need a fourth."

I can imagine many uses for Meshqu plaques here on Earth. Various sets 
for various types of situations ... Somebody could get rich! Royalties 
for old retired professors? (Kidding, of course). ;-)
