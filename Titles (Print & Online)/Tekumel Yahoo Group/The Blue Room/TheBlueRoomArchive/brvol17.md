These messages are the accumulation of the messages that were sent out on 
the Blue Room email list between May 1995 and June 2000.  A large portion 
of the information is directly from Professor M.A.R Barker. When the list 
members joined during the time the list was active, they agreed to refrain 
from sharing this data with non list members.  When the list ended, it was 
urged that the data be made available to non-list Tekumel fans, and it 
seemed like a good idea all around.

I only ask that if you download these digests, or have received them in 
some other way, please respect the agreements the list members made, and 
refrain from passing them around and instead point people to the Tekumel 
web site, www.tekumel.com so that they can download them for themselves, 
and see all the other material available on the Tekumel.com web site.

Many Thanks.

[Moderator's Note:  Chuck Monson throws out some ideas for the Tsolyani    ]
[                   Language sub-list.  The Prof has offered to help out,  ]
[                   short of writing excercises, etc.  But maybe record-   ]

[                   will depend on the Professor, though.                  ]

Kenji has an idea about the language aspect of Tekumel that might be an
intersting project. 

There are some neat ways to get a sound library established. Is there enough
interest to provide the right equipment to the Prof for a soundwave library
on Tsolyani or other vocalizations. (I can't believe I want to hear the
temple chants again...oi!) 
While the sacrificial highlights over at the Temple of (Your Choice) and the
social value of listening to some wretch taking the High Ride may leap to
mind as really neat soundwaves...I think out of respect we could let the Prof
outline the project. 

We should avoid stressing out the Professor by trying to get him to wear a
headset recorder ... he may just refuse to speak at all while we're about
it...THAT reminds me of one of Barker's own research ventures into the
jungles!...moreover,  I think he may find use for a couple of his 'wall
decorations'', particulalry the gut scissors...Why do I remember them looking
freshly oiled?

If the intrigues of culture and communication are the driving values for
exploring Tekumel, perhaps Kenji has a notion well worth supporting.

You cannot forget the important fact that Tekumel is not a natural planet.
When the ancestors of the Great Ancients arrived, Tekumel's atmosphere was
indeed "a reducing witches brew," where the Ssu and the Hluss did play.
How the Ssu survived without employing the great atmospheric domes that the
Shunned Ones use is unknown -- possibly their atmospheric needs are
entirely different from ours.  They were not primitives, however, and may
have possessed whatever serves as an analog of "genetics" in order to adapt
themselves to the new environment.  
Possibly they were helped by the equivalent of "Greenpeace" of that distant
era.

Likewise with the planet's gravity and magnetic field:  it is important to
remember that Tekumel's day and year are not literary conveniences, but the
result of the planet's actually having been MOVED into its present orbit
and spun to match the timetable employed by the humans of the interstellar
empire.  If the gravitic engines which drive the planet were to ever shut
down, the natural gravitational pull of the planet would probably reassert
itself with cataclysmic effect.  If these engines ever malfunctioned
beneath one or the other regions of the surface, the effect would probably
be enough to sink continents and raise seas...

Tekumel probably once had a more distant orbit, and we know it once had a
dense unbreathable atmosphere.  Kashi and Gayel probably orbit as they due
strictly for the convenience of the Great Ancients.  And none of these
orbits need to be strictly maintainable from the sense of physics...
because the engines of the Great Ancients are still nudging them about to
this very day.

Back to work on the Hru'u chapter...

[The Professor's Response]

As I have said many times, I am *not* an astronomer or even an amateur
stargazer. I am not a rocket scientist! I only tell you what I see and what
is reported to me by the inhabitants of Tekumel.

As for the moons' orbits and periods, you are welcome to work them out, as
I have said. "Cooking them up" sounds suspiciously artificial, but that's
up to you.

As for the diametre of Tekumel and its chances of being a gas giant,
remember that Tekumel was terraformed -- and probably completely tranformed
-- when Humankind first expanded into this region of space. It seemed to
fit all the other criteria of being a useful "crossroads" planet, with
commerce, pleasure resources, etc. etc., and the first settlers terraformed
it and established great gravity engines down inside the core someplace.
Some of you who have played in my older campaigns may have actually
glimpsed these great machines. How these work is not my cuppa, so I leave
it to you.

The Ssu and Hluss are not happy with the present terraformed version of
Tekumel, but they seem to have adapted. Humanity -- and its allies and
trading partners who ended up on Tekumel -- are apparently just fine. The
Shunned Ones require a different atmosphere, so they live in their sealed
cities. Everybody else makes do.

I wish I could tell you more, but this kind of "hard science" is *way*
beyond my  pore punkin haid.

Love to see others produce it, though.

The facts and figures in S&G I are not exact, of course. These were the
best I could manage, under the circumstances.

Terraforming works wonders!

We've had would-be astronmers complain before. I can only tell 'em to cook
things up as they think fit.

Terraforming... Complete restructring and inserting of gravity machines,
air-producing devices, plus plant and algae species from a variety of
worlds, and lots of science that still lies millennia in our future.

[Moderator's Note:  The Professor gives up a little bit of info about the  ]

Arksa hiVayka is considered a pleasant but rather harmless gentleman by
those in the inner circles of the Ndalu Clan. His information is more
"surface" than "substance." What he says is usually fact, but he only
scratches the surface -- the sort of thing that the "Uncle Ksarul Wants
YOU" recruiting posters tell you.

>Meanwhile, what can you tell me of my masters in the Ndalu Clan?

You may not want to know. There are some very intricate machinations out there.
My players always joke that it's the little old lady cleaning the latrines
in the Temple of Ksarul in Bey Su who is the *real* leader of the Inner
Circle. They're only slightly wrong.

>I find it interesting that there is only one other secret society to

The history of the Ndalu Clan seems to go back to Great Jraka, the Aspect
of Lord Ksarul that was popular in Bednalljan times. The origins of "Ndalu"
are lost in history, as are the reasons for calling the organisation a
"clan." If this information is still known, it is a dark and very
well-guarded secret.

Probably correct -- but off by several thousand years and many dynasties!
The Ndalu Clan was probably the political foe of Pavar's followers in the
early, early days of the Ensgvanyali Empire. They may be still older,
though considerably altered. There are hints here and there that they had
to do with resistance to the Dragon Warriors. None of this is clear or
evidenced by good proofs, but so go the stories.

Nice Jajgi?  Let me tell you about a run in we had with a nice Jajgi!

If I remember correctly, and I often fail to do so, we were deep under a
temple of Sarku, possibly in Sarku City, I forget where.  Anyway, we were
down there looking fo a way out when a Jajgi and a few of his retainers
jumped us.  We tried some spells that had no effect, and I think we tried
combat for a few rounds and failed to have any major effect.  We were
running down the halls trying to get some distance from this guy who had
become the closest thing he could to Lord Sarku's Ideal, Dead, but still
alive.  We rounded a corner and Lord Sanjesh hit on the only thing he had
left that he could try.  As Mr Ideal rounded the corner, Sanjesh took aim
and nailed him right between the eyes with an eye of revivication.  The
look of shock on his face was astounding.  To be that close to your god,
and then be brought back by a Thumis priest with attitude must really ruin
a guys day.

[Moderator's Note:  Steve Foster comments on the Moons discussion.          ]

Re the Tekumel Moons debate:

A moon's orbit is characterised by far more than just its orbital period. 
Before you could explain their behaviour, you'd need to know the 
eccentricity of the orbits (they probably aren't circular but elliptical 
and hence move through the sky at different rates at different times in 
their orbit.) 

[Moderator's Note:  I believe I have read somewhere that the terraformers   ]
[gave the moons circular orbits.  I tried to find it, but couldn't.  Anyone ]
[else remember this?  Phil?                                                 ]

You'd alo need to know their inclination of their orbital 
planes (their orbits might be tilted at quite different angles) and the 
longtitude of their ascending nodes (which might mean that their orbits 
are skewed out of sync as seen from "above"). When you consider all of 
these, it would be possible to have some very complex relationships 
between the phases of the moons. the idea of "full together, new together" 
is far too simplistic.

There is also a little matter of tidal resonances. In our solar system, we 
see a great number of examples of this. Basically, orbital perturbations 
tend to make the orbital period of one body more stable if it is a simple 
fraction (1/2, 2/3, 3/5, etc) of the orbital period of the other. A ratio 
of 2:1 for Kashi and Gayel is almost more likely than not.

The colours of the moons are more puzzling. Our own moon appears 
silver-white from Earth even though its mostly a very dark, dirty 
brownish-grey when you get up close. For Kashi and Gayel to show distinct 
colours implies something very odd about their surfaces.

Having ranted on about a little astronomy, I'd just like to say that I 
*know* that it's Devices of the Ancients that keep them in their orbits. 
I've even used one of them, The Creation Matrix, but that's another 
story...

Steve-- and Chris, Professor, &c.:

I'll admit to making some fast-- yet sensible-- assumptions. Of -course-
all orbits are eccentric, but unless that value reads 'zero' to at least two
places they aren't orbits-- they're cometary trajectories. What you gain on the
windage, you lose on the shy; Kepler's laws still apply.

The same principle applies to tidal resonances. Yes, again, the moons
would perturb each other, but they are both tide-locked to Tekumel itself, so
these effects are, by comparison, trivial. (Phobos and Deimos perturb each other
too, but compared to Mars's gravitational gradient... forget it.)

"You'd also need to know the inclination of their orbital planes (their
orbits might be tilted at quite different angles)..."

No, I don't; they still orbit Tekumel's center of gravity, and thus cross
the equatorial plane twice in each revolution, -whatever- their relative
inclination may be. Even a circumpolar orbit does so, yes?

"When you consider all of these, it would be possible to have some very
complex relationships between the phases of the moons. The idea of 'full
together, new together' is far too simplistic."

No, it isn't; unless they orbited each other as a binary system, itself
in a distant orbit around the planet-- which would be interesting, but 'tain't
so, McGee-- then each must be considered, for practical purposes, as alone in
the sky-- and one having twice the orbital period of the other, would appear
full and new, each and both, in the course of a thirty-day period.

As to being placed in perfectly circular orbits-- well, as Steve
realized, it's a neat trick if you can do it; suffice it to say that such orbits
have NEVER EXISTED for any object, natural or manmade. (Which is not to say you
can't come Real Close...) But as Phil said elsewhere, they wouldn't have stayed
that way, and he was quite right. ('Trivial' perturbations -do- add up, over
time.)

[Moderator's Note:  Anyone who could change the orbit could probably make   ]
[                   object travel in any path they chose.  The great engines]
[                   could be constantly correcting, and re-correcting the   ]
[                   path of the orbit so it stays perfectly circular.  I do ]
[                   understand that there never has been such an orbit, but ]
[                   50 years ago there weren't any microchips either.       ]

Which brings me to my final point-- this business of, "... it's Devices
of the Ancients that keep them in their orbits."

Horse puckey. That's as bad as Newton's raptures about the Divine
Clockwork-- worse, because you could make a -case- for that. Why are the moons
-orbiting-, if they're not, actually, orbiting? Why aren't they standing still
in the sky? Be a lot easier...

[Moderator's Note:  Don't split hairs with us Gordon!  :)  We know the moons]
[                   are orbiting.  It's the Devices of the Ancients that    ]
[                   keep them in the "proper" orbit (or what has become the ]
[                   proper orbit).  Who knows why they chose perfect circles]
[                   (if they did) for the moons' orbits?  Maybe the terra-  ]
[                   forming department's head orbital-engineer was a        ]
[                   symmetry freak?  :)                                     ]

That's not to say that they couldn't have been moved, -as needed-, but
otherwise, well, if they're not in standard ballistic orbits, they's sho' nuff a
good -counterfeit-... and why bother?

G.

P.S. "Our own moon appears silver-white from Earth even though it's mostly a
very dark, dirty brownish-grey when you get up close." Yeah, the Moon is
actually the color of -asphalt-, just like any parking lot... but if you think
about it, of course it seems bright, by comparison; it -is- the only thing up
there. If it really were as the song describes it, "the light of the silvery
Moon" would be -way- too bright to look at directly...

"For Kashi and Gayel to show distinct colours implies something very odd
about their surfaces." Probably nothing too arcane; Kashi, 'bloody orange-red,'
sounds awfully Mars-like in composition. For Gayel to be 'emerald-green,'
though... now, that -is- a trifle odd. Green, no problem. Copper oxides, to
Kashi's own iron compounds, would do that... but -emerald-?

Mystery... Maybe it's one gigantic life-form. A species of algae, massing
millions of metric tons. (If it caught a phage, the consternation below would 
be calamitous!)

It all started when I attended a party in Jakalla at the clanhouse of the
most mighty and noble Ito.  Having lost over 5,000 Kaitars at Tsahlten, I
decided my interests would better be served by finding some agreeable,
athletic noblewoman with whom to pass the night (this is, after all,
Jakalla in springtime, as I'm sure you understand, William).  Wandering
down a side corridor, I came upon a small room.  Within the room, lying
langorously upon a sleeping-mat covered with thesun-gauze, was the woman
of my dreams!  Since no meshqu plaque was displayed, I clapped gently to
ask admittance.

The woman upon the mat made no reply, so I clapped louder.  Again no
result!

Fearing some foul play (this is, after all, Jakalla in springtime, as I'm
sure you understand, William), I crept into the room.  Imagine my surprise
when my langorous beauty showed no signs of a pulse, nor did her breath
fog my small mirror!  La, a murder had taken place!

Acting -- I am sure you will agree -- both nobly and with an eye toward
earning this beauty's gratitude, I called to my servant to bring me my
pouch.  When he did, acting nervous for some reason I could not at the
time fathom, I brought forth my Eye of Resurrection, pointed it at the
woman, and pressed the stud.

La, she sat bolt upright upon the mat, eyes shining with strong emotion --
and issued forth a scream the likes of which I hope never to hear again!
She immediately began berating me with all manner of abuse; I tried to
correct her to explain that I was the one who had *saved* her, when all of
a sudden the hall was full of guards in copper armor!

Fearing that these were the murderers who had reduced her to the state in
which I found her -- ah, William, I think you now apprehend that they
indeed *were*, but I was in combat and my years as a Tirrikamu had taken
over -- I took no note of the fact that these guardsmen wore their brown
armor accented with thin strips of sky-blue, but grabbed the woman, slung
her over my shoulder, and exited through a window to the screams of my
servant fighting a brief, but doomed, rear-guard action.

To make a long story short, I thought my best course of action was to -- I
know, William, but remember I had partaken fully of drink and drugs at the
party -- well, to take her instantly to my Legion headquarters and alert
my comrades of the need for armed reponse.

You can guess what happened next.

Anyway, I am now in a small cell, awaiting the Mrikh come to fetch me to
my death on charges of treason.  I send you this email as my last hope; I
pray that you can find some way to save this foolish Hereksa who attempted
to rescue a very irate Jajgi from her meditations.  Do you have a file,
somewhere in that 650,000 that will spare me from what appears to be
certain doom?

[Moderator's Note:  Joe Saul asks some questions about Jajgi.               ]

You ask a lot of kinky questions.

>Is a Jajgi legally a person in Tsolyanu?

The question does not arise since Jajgi are not numerous or prominent
enough to appear in public where they might be noticed. They are few, and
their creators in the temples of Sarku, etc. keep them pretty secret. There
are indeed some Jajgi masquerading as living humans. These work for the
temples and usually go out on missions and then come back inside where they
seem to be more comfortable.

>There are a lot of implications to this question, but the issues I'm
>specifically interested in are:
>
>-- If you kill a Jajgi, can its clan ask for Shamtla?

Never happened. The clans from which a Jajgi may come are usually unaware
of their "relative" or perhaps unwilling to accept the fact that one of their
brothers is now walking around again when he shouldn't be. The Jajgi are
usually only found in the deepest and most secret shrines of the relevant
deities, although some of them are sent out as absolutely trustworthy
agents on missions.

>-- Can a Jajgi be prosecuted for crimes it commits?

Never happened. The Jajgi works under strict temple supervision -- seems to
have  almost a "mind-bar" like loyalty to its creators -- and hence carries
out temple commands. This gets into politics and is not usually a legal
matter per se. There are no Jajgi murderers, thieves, rapists, or
shoplifters that act on their own and commit "crimes" out of greed.

>-- Can a Jajgi duel under the Manifesto of Noble Deliverance?

Never happened. I doubt this would occur unless the Jajgi was masquerading
as a human. Then it might get involved -- but it would speedily call for
temple back-up to get it out of the situation so that its status as a Jajgi
would not be revealed.

>-- Can Jajgi legally marry?  (Just kidding...)

They can and do -- as part of a masquerade. They can marry each other or
some willing partisan of their temple. They may not be able to "perform,"
except magically, of course.

They are a lot more intelligent than the usual Hollywood "zombie" (Mrur or
Shedra-like), and even Bela Lugosi doesn't come close. The guy next to you
at the barbershop may be a Jajgi. THere are no distinguishing marks or
signs, unless the creature forgets to breathe.

You are mostly correct, but the area is (literally and figuratively) a
"grey" one. The Jajgi do not interact much with the living, except when on
missions for their temples. Some missions last longer than others, of
course, and it is quite possible that a Jajgi may be put into society for a
year or more at a time in order to achieve some objective.

Some less-polite critics have averred that Dhich'une himself is a Jajgi. I
cannot say whether they are right or wrong.

I will be running a Tekumel event at the Dexcon 6 game convention.  My
adventure (listed under "Empire of the Petal Throne") is called
"Unwelcoming Party", and will run Wednesday, July 2, from 8:00 PM until
midnight and will be repeated Saturday, July 5 from 8:00 PM until midnight.
 Although the game will be open to beginners new to Tekumel, the scenario
would benefit from having experienced Tekumel hands on board.  As with most
of my Tekumel scenarios, the emphasis is more on roleplaying than combat. 
(For those in the know, this is NOT a sequel of my "A Matter of
Honor/Against the Grain" scenarios.)

The convention will be July 2-6, in the Meadowlands Plaza, in East
Rutherford, New Jersey (right across the highway from Giants Stadium).  You
can find out more about the convention at http://www.io.com/~doublex/ or by

I am not affiliated with the Double Exposure people in any way other than
as a convention gamemaster.

If you have any questions about the scenario (not the con!  I don't know!)

Sarku is "Change" in the real sense of slow change from life to death and
beyond. He is not swift or violent, but he *is* Change. He is also an
observer of Change. He delights in viewing the gradual alteration of the
cosmos, while himself standing outside of it. His devotees are advised to
live long and to return to consciousness after death in order to observe
the effects of long-term Change.

Good thinking -- but unsubstantiated by Tekumel data. I knoq some out there
want "real" science and believe in the essential truth of "Science" as we
know it today. Yet just a few centuries ago the established view of
"Science" included the Ptolmaic astronomical system, no circulation of the
blood, the "fact" that there were only five planets, and the further fact
that the universe had seven heavens, and God sat up there on a golden
throne. Galileo and Copernicus and others came along and changed all that
-- but did they change it to "The Truth" -- *all* the Truth -- or is it
likely that the future will bring us different understandings of "reality"
that we cannot predict today? I don't know. Neither does anybody else. As I
have said, I only report what I see on Tekumel; I am not concerned with
"how things work" -- just like the Star Trek fans who don't care that the
"Beam me down, Scotty" transporter cannot possibly work -- or how everybody
always looks human with rubber pieces glued on their foreheads -- or how
the never-seen, mysterious "universal translator" device makes everyone
seem to speak perfect 20th Century American English, even when the speakers
are lost on some planet far far away...

... And did Deja Thoris run really around half-nekkid in the frigid
atmosphere of Mars? Now *there's* a scientific mystery!

[Moderator's Note:  Joe Saul asks about marriages and clan membership.      ]

Joe seems very interested in getting married lately. Last time he asked
about *Jajgi* getting married.  Hmm

>Tsolyani marriages can take place either between members of the same clan, or
>members of two different clans.  We already know that a child of a "mixed
>marriage" can become a member of either the father's or the mother's clan.
>Here are a few questions on things I, at least, don't know:
>
>1.  Is clan affiliation determined at birth, or later (at, say, the naming
>    ceremony)?

It is usually decided *before* birth, as soon as the parents know the
mother is pregnant. Clansmen from both sides then start discussing the
membership of the infant(s)-to-be. Clan affiliation is *confirmed* at the
later naming ceremony, or in some clans, on special occasions of their own.

>2.  Does the higher clan automatically get the kid?  The lower one?  The
>    one whose clanhouse they're living in?

Nobody *automatically* gets the kid. Sometimes the lower clan may want the
infant more and be willing to pay the higher clan a price for it. Sometimes
the higher clan may want the child. Sometimes the parents' wishes will be
taken into account: "Mom wanted me to be in Golden Sunburst, but Dad's from
White Stone -- that's why I'm in Golden Sunburst. Mom usually wins all
arguments in our family."

>3.  What if, say, a woman of Golden Bough married a man of Sea Blue and
>    a man of Golden Sunburst?  If she's sleeping with both of them regularly,
>    the only *certain* affiliation for the kid is Golden Bough -- but they

This is a tough one. Sometimes this kind of case ends up in a law court.
These are often solved by clanmasters who meet privately and decide on the
rights and wrongs of the matter on economic and personal grounds. The
opinions of the lineage-family are taken into account, but if nobody
agrees, then it is left to almost a flip of a coin to finalise it. Economic
factors almost always do include perceived privileges.

>4.  A man has a female slave, who becomes pregant with (presumably) his
>    child.  Is the child a member of the father's clan?

Not automatically. Slave children usually stay slaves -- unless the father
wants them freed and goes to the Palace of the Realm to get the legal work
done. A doting father is a very good investment for a slave-child.

>5.  If so, is there any stigma to being slave-born?

Yes, but not to slave-children who have been freed (cf. preceding
paragraph). Many slaves are actually fairly middle-class or even
low-upper-class people who have been enslaved for crimes or for debt.
Hence, if their offspring climb back up out of slavery, they are considered
smart,enterprising, or just damn lucky.

[Moderator's Note:  Joe Saul asks questions about miscellaneous topics.     ]

>First, is there a title which goes with membership in the Advisory Curia?  Is
>that where Tsemel is used?  I seem to recall titles having rough
>equivalency to "Cardinal" and "Bishop," but I'm not sure where I saw them.
>I think Tsemel has been translated as "Cardinal," but whether that's a

>not sure.

The "Advisory Curia (lit. "Council the Temples of the Almighty Gods") is a
priestly focus group for issues that affect all sorts of temple and
religious matters: from people selling fried fish in front of a shrine to
Lord Vimuhla, to the right to build a retaining wall between two adjacent
temples, to the rude and sarcastic remarks made by priest X against priest
Y -- and so forth.

Tsemel is largely an administrative title. It doesn't really connote what
English "Cardinal" does, but remember that these European titles were taken
over for "Empire of the Petal Throne," where Mr. Gygax wanted everything to
dovetail into D-n-D. He thought they would be more familiar to American
readers. Instead, this just confused the issue of what, precisely, the
Tsolyani titles are.

>Second, are literacy rates different for men and women in Tsolyanu?

Yes. About 9-10 percent for males and 3-5 percent for women, depending on
the locale, clan status, membership in a temple, etc. Most 'good clan
girls" may have only rudimentary reading, while most Aridani can read
simple letters and documents in Tsolyani. Those who are higher on the
social ladder usually are literate.

>Third, is there a Vimuhla martial art, or just the Thumis and Ksarul ones?

Not that I know of. Vimuhla's priests consider their daily warlike
exercises and rituals to be better than anything Thumis and/or Ksarul can
do anyway.

>Finally, are Ritual/Admin/Scholarly Priests allowed to decide to become Lay
>Priests at some point in their career?  And how exactly *is* a Lay Priest's
>circle rank determined?

Technically, if you have a *post* in a temple hierarchy, you should not
quit to go become a scholar-priest. This is considered ignoble: "letting
down the side." But in fact it does occur. Lay-priests really have no
circle rank: that is in the game and not in "real" Tekumel. They become
known for this or that scholarly or wizardly expertise, and they are then
addressed with honorary pronouns, etc. Since they do not hold temple ranks
they are not burdened with Monday-morning staff meetings and pressures from
the bureaucracy to downsize the workforce.

[Moderator's Note:  Lisa Leutheuser asks about divorce in Tsolyanu.        ]

>The various sourcebooks have general descriptions about marriage
>ceremonies, but the only reference to divorce I've found is for
>Pe Choi divorces.  How are human divorces handled in Tsolyanu?
>Is it different if the woman is Aridane?

Divorce in Tsolyanu is the ending of a contract between Mr. A and Mrs. A.
If these two had been formally married, the clan (of either) will hold a
party, the original marriage contract will be produced and torn up in front
of all, financial and property settlements (made in advance by go-betweens)
are formalised and announced, the future homes of any children are settled,
and everybody then eats, drinks, and has a good time. There may be jocular
speeches, entertainment, and jokes (which the ex-bride and ex-groom must
grin and bear). If there is real hostility between the parties, this party
is not held, of course, and the husband and wife deal with one another
through intermediaries.

If there are disputes over the children and where they will live, the
relevant clans are first brought in to decide the matter. An arbiter may be
chosen who is agreeable to both parties. If neutral consultation fails, the
Palace of the Realm may be approached by envoys from both sides bringing
evidence.

The only difference between an Aridani divorcee and a "good clan-girl"
relates to property: the Aridani woman may own property in her own right
and have to split it up with her ex-husband, according to the terms of
their marriage contract. Her clan does not get involved, unless there are
larger issues -- very similar to a contract between two men over some other
issue. Who owns a piece of farmland, or a business, or a building, can
sound very much like a divorce between Mr. and Mrs. A. A "good clan girl"
is represented by her clans, and any property she has acquired may be taken
over by her clansmen as belonging not to her as an individual but to her
clan.

Divorce has religious connotations only in one or two of the Tsolyani
temples (e.g. Sarku). Otherwise, a priest who attends a divorce ceremony is
there only for the food!

From Bob Alberti...

The moons ARE orbiting.  99.999% of the time they are serenely rolling around
the edge of the gravity well, obeying the laws of physics and not even
speeding.

Once in a while, however, it's time for an adjustment.  Keeping a planet
the size of Tekumel spinning at the distance and rate to ensure 365 days 
per year requires a gentle "nudge" every now and then from the planetary
engines.  And it has to be VERY gentle, because you don't want people 
squashed flat in Onchosh Chiran, or hurled a hundred feet into the air
in Malchiran, when the orbit is adjusted.

Well, this still screws up the orbits of the moons.  They'd go sailing off
or come crashing down if the planet were to go jumping around underneath
them.  At the very least their orbits would change significantly over 
the vast periods of time since the system was established.  So they, too
have to be nudged into place again.

Perfectly circular?  Who cares!  Just gotta keep them in place...

From Stephen Foster....

Chris,

I couldn't let this one go unanswered due to the use of the 
phrase "Horse Puckey"....

Gordon,

You seem a little confused on the subject of orbital mechanics:

>Of -course-
>all orbits are eccentric, but unless that value reads 'zero' to at 
>least two places they aren't orbits-- they're cometary trajectories.

By your definition, then, the Earth is a comet (e=0.017) as 
is the Moon (e=0.055)! I suggest you also note the large 
eccentricities of Mercury (0.206) and Pluto (0.248). In 
fact, only Venus has an eccentricity less than 0.01. Comets, 
too, are usually in quite stable orbits despite their high 
eccentricity so the phrase "cometary trajectory" is 
meaningless. If you really want a bizzare but stable orbit 
then consider Earth's second moon (yes, we have at least 
two) which is a small asteroid discovered in 1986 designated 
3753. This moves in a strange orbit reminiscent of an 
bumble-bee on acid, with no simply defined eccentricity, yet 
is definitely gravitationally bound to the Earth. I see no 
reason why Gayel and Kashi could not have quite eccentric 
orbits.

>The same principle applies to tidal resonances. Yes, again, the moons
>would perturb each other, but they are both tide-locked to Tekumel 
>itself, so these effects are, by comparison, trivial. 

Not so! The gravitational effect of the moons on each other 
would be quite substantial. This phenomenon is seen all over 
the solar system even among the particles that make up 
Saturn's ring. (The effect causes the various gaps in the 
rings, which are at simple fractions of the orbital periods 
of the inner moons). If the orbital planes of Kashi and 
Gayel are at all near the same plane then they will almost 
certainly be linked in some resonance (...assuming that they 
are natural bodies, that is).

>No, I don't; they still orbit Tekumel's center of gravity, and thus 
>cross the equatorial plane twice in each revolution, -whatever- their 
>relative inclination may be.


You need to know the inclinations of their orbital planes 
because a highly inclined orbit can give rise to some wierd 
effects. For example if Kashi's orbit were at exactly 90 
degrees to Tekumel's then you would only get 2 full moons 
per year! (Kashi's orbit would maintain its orientation in 
space as Tekumel moved around its sun so it would only be 
"full" then the plane of its orbit was in line with the sun 
as seen from Tekumel. If you don't understand (or 
believe)this then try reading about seasons on Uranus from 
any decent astronomy text book) However, since such wierd 
effects aren't mentioned by Prof Barker I would imagine that 
the orbits of Tekumel, Kashi and Gayel are in approximately 
the same plane.

>No, it isn't; unless they orbited each other as a binary system, itself
>in a distant orbit around the planet-- which would be interesting, but 
>'tain't so, McGee-- then each must be considered, for practical purposes, 
>as alone in the sky-- and one having twice the orbital period of the 
>other, would appear full and new, each and both, in the course of a 
>thirty-day period.

For the reasons just stated, this is quite untrue. As I 
said, there are orbits which would mean just 2 new moons per 
year for each moon. Even for more normal orbits, a slight 
degree of eccentricity will put subtle phase shifts into the 
picture. For example, there might only be 199 full moons of 
Kashi for each 100 of Gayel.

>Horse puckey. That's as bad as Newton's raptures about the Divine
>Clockwork-- worse, because you could make a -case- for that. Why are 
>the moons -orbiting-, if they're not, actually, orbiting? Why aren't 
>they standing still in the sky? Be a lot easier...

Actually, the situation I envisaged is to simply keep the 
moons orbiting in what would otherwise be non-stable orbits. 
Do we know that a body of Kashi's mass at its distance from 
Tekumel *should* orbit in exactly 15 days? Maybe it should 
really be 16 or 12, but the Ancients decided to change 
things a little. With the Creation Matrix, you'd only have 
to wish it so...

Subject: Moons of Tekumel: You are looking in the wrong places for an answer

Ho!  La!  You are seeking answers on Earth about Tekumel.  If you truly wish
an answer you will need to find out about the orbits of the moons of Tekumel
on Tekumel.  I believe the answers to these questions regarding the moons can
be found in either of four places.

1)  Eloa's Palace in the Tlashte Heights:  You will need to present several
sets of human eyes to the Thunru'u at the gate and humbly request to see
Achan hi'Sayanu.  (Address him in Livyani and for your lives' sake do not
laugh at his tatoos or his outrageous Tsolyani accent when he attempts to
speak Livyani).  If available, and in one of his rare generous moods,  he
will show you the disks and you have to sort through them yourself. You will
not be allowed to access the intraplanetary controls as only members of the
Tlashte clan have access to those chambers by genetic signatures.

2) The Old Imperial Palace on a small island far to the west of the known
world: Access code M7184672R-and then enter Moons.  You will need to cross
several planes of existance and time eras to get to the palace. 

3) The Repository of Knowledge at Onchash Chairon.  When you reach the city,
introduce yourself as a random element and ask to speak to Chaom Shorqa, A
Defender of the Sixth Evolution, he can lead you into the catacombs beneath
the citadel where the old ones sleep.  He may have to enlist assistance from
others in his group. (a Knower or an Eventuator). Beware of Nichasa, she has
more daggers than an arms dealer and will use them at the slightest
provocation.  More knowledge of this area and specific instructions can be
obtained from Tekunu hi'Qolyelmu of the Golden Sunburst Clan in Jakalla.

4) The Orbital Planetary Defense Station: You will get an answer of sorts
from the androids.  But you will never be able to leave.  Eventually you will
make some error and will die horribly.

If you truly want an answer you will need to travel to find it.  Dr. Barker
and Mr. Alberti may know of several other locations that you could go to find
an answer, perhaps the College of Wizards, the Unstraightened City, that old
man who lives on the beach on the eastern side of the continent.....

Robin Carpenter adds...

<< "For Kashi and Gayel to show distinct colours implies something very odd
 about their surfaces." Probably nothing too arcane; Kashi, 'bloody
orange-red,'
 sounds awfully Mars-like in composition. For Gayel to be 'emerald-green,'
 though... now, that -is- a trifle odd. Green, no problem. Copper oxides, to
 Kashi's own iron compounds, would do that... but -emerald-? >

Metallic oxides presuppose oxygen, don't they?  Perhaps I'm mistaken, but
aren't the moons too small to have their own atmosphere?  I would have to
resort to machinations of the Ancients to explain the color of the moons --
in which case, add color to the list of "why would the ancients do that"
issues.  I can see maintaining circular orbits just because it isn't natural
-- as a demonstration of expertise or power, or as a beacon to alien races.

[Moderator's Note:  Steven Woodcock notes another vampiric reference in the  ]
[                   bestiary.                                                ]

Actually, a note to the previous remarks about Tekumelani vampirism.  A
note in the Bestiary caught my eye a while ago, which described the Kokh
(a bloodsucking lizard) as being "sacred to one of the vampire-demonesses
of Lady Dlamelish's sect."  While "standard" vampires don't work on
Tekumel, maybe much the same use could be made of a low-level Dlamelish
demon(ess)  with similar interests.  The Pa'iya story from one of the
Adventures books has a certain vampire-like quality (seduction, draining
life force), and I doubt if the Sharetlkoi age either.  Religious
alignments would then become more sensible (no fear of crosses, but
whatever that Qon priest is waving. . .)

While not necessarily kosher, a World of Darkness/Tekumel cross might be
interesting; vampires/jajgi or demons, werewolves/the Company of
Less-than-Men?, mages/priests?, wraiths/?, changelings/Mihalli???  Well,
it's just a thought.

perhaps there's a further audience in the Blue Room.  (I have a Mac

ON THE WORSHIP OF THE MOST HOLY LORD SARKU

*****************************************************************************

An address given by Jadhak hiChna'el of the Clan of the Ebon
Blade, Eleventh Circle scholar priest of the Lord Sarku, in his
clanhouse in Tleku, Thayuri Isle, on the occasion of the
Festival of the Breaking Open of the Tomb on the 12th Night of
Trantor.

Translated by David Chatterjee, with thanks to Ginge Laurie for help
with the carols.

December 1995.

*****************************************************************************

Yohoho! Are we all having a lovely time? [Chorus of screams from the
audience.] Do you know who I am? Don't you recognize my raggedy old
red Bednalljan gudru robes and the whispy trails of white fungus
over my hair and face? That's right! I'm Vergessai the
Dispenser of Blessings [25th Aspect of Lord Sarku], who brings the
gift of death to all good little children everywhere!

Today is a very special day, as we all know: tonight the wonderful
Lord Sarku (e-ver-bless-ed-be-His-Name) [the children chant along] the
wonderful Lord Sarku rises to stalk the face of the world looking to
see who's been a faithful little demon and who's been a disobedient
rascal bringing shame and dishonour to his clan and making this tired
old wanderer very unhappy. Has anyone been naughty this year? [No!]
Good. Because then I can be busy tonight finding all the tombs of your
glorious ancestors and crawling down into them through the dark heavy
earth, and blessing them all for being such honourable people and
faithful worshippers of Me.

And if any of you has been really noble this year - has anyone?
[looking round dubiously] - I can do my favourite thing. I can ask my
friend the Black Angel of the Putrescent Hand [one child shouts out,
Lord Durritlamish!] to look into His amazing Vessel of the Vision of
the World and find out where your tomb will be when you die; and I'll
claw My way into it before it's even there and leave you a very
special present so that you can come straight to join Me in My
splendid Halls for all eternity - wouldn't that be lovely!

[Slaves bring in some mince pies and dronu. Meanwhile a singer in
the corner starts crooning "Silent night, holy night" and
"God rest ye, merry Sarku men" whilst the adults hum along.]

Eat up children. I'm afraid you're all too young to eat real minced
flesh and drink real blood like your clan-parents will do later on in
My shrine. [Yeurgh! from the audience; gentle smiles from the watching
adults. The carols move on to "While shepherds watched their hma by
night".] This year we're eating Uncle Ujutetl who died last month, do
you remember? The nice priests saved a little part of him in case he
was the last to die before tonight, and luckily for him he was, isn't
that nice? That will help him go straight to heaven: he'll be the
first person I see tonight when I go visiting everybody's
graves. Shall I say hello from you all? [Yesss!]

Shall we sing some carols or do you want your presents now?
[Presents!! Four adults dressed as corpses enter bearing a
sarcophagus, which opens.] Oh look, here's my magical helper,
Zaidza of the Liquescent Mould, who comes to carry you to paradise
if you die in your sleep! Say hello to Princess Zaidza, children -
but don't get too close!

[The Princess starts offering small gifts to the children, who line up
nicely: tiny copper skulls and silver rings to hang as charms; various
favourite dried seafood delicacies the children rarely see; little
toys and gadgets from Jakalla or Chame'el.]

Come on, come on, I haven't got all night you know. Longest night of
the year and all that but even so. There are so many sepulchres to
break open and reseal, and especially the ones of the Bereshkordashmu
lineage during the middle Engsvanyali, they really knew how to make
them last I can tell you. There was one time when I was a third circle
stripling [the audience is slipping away from Jadhak] - err - does
anyone know the story of Ritonmel the Red-Nosed Vorodla? [Yes!, and Of
course!]  What about the tale of the late wizard Sivuse hiVoroshketl,
clan-ancestor of young Jangaiva and Raimani here, who was out of his
tomb guarding his clan from danger late one cold Trantor night when
the monsoon came early and washed him away and he had to try to get
back home safely before the vengeful Vergessai - err, me of course -
found him missing and cast him into the Halls of Ever-Blazing Flame to
dry him out (may the love of the Lord of Worms defend us all from such
a fate) ...

[The children settle down to listen. Krezhmadz cake is brought in -
krezhmadz is a Salarvyani delicacy extracted from the glands of
the gorrdzha slug - and the Princess of the Liquescent Mould breaks
into the traditional crispy white "domed tomb" cake with an
extended claw, to finger-snapping applause from the adults. Slaves
offer the crumbled masonry to the audience revealing the dark, moist
flesh beneath, flecked with slivers of fruit and laced with
tsuhoridu. The adults each take a piece and file out, singing
"The Twelve Days of Trantor", to ready themselves for the
night's rituals in the catacombs. The children sit, enraptured by
Jadhak's tale of solstices past.]

	We five worms of Sarku are.
	Devouring flesh, we burrow afar -
	Field and fountain,
	Moor and mountain,
	Following yonder shedra.

	O - Worm of wonder,
	Worm of blight,
	Worm with deathly beauty bright.
	Downward leading,
	Still proceeding,
	Guide us to Thy perfect night.

[Moderator's note:  Here is the second of David's articles on Sarku.       ]

The worship of Sarku is of course a minority interest on Thayuri, and
Thayuri is not often on the top of the agenda in Sarku City, so I wouldn't
be surprised to learn that the views expressed here aren't quite kosher.
In published articles, the Professor has emphasised the more gruesome
aspects of worship, as seen by the Tsolyani populace and by the Copper
Tomb faction.  Of course there must be other perspectives, and this was an
attempt some time ago to give them voice.  Dave.

ON THE WORSHIP OF THE LORD SARKU

*****************************************************************************

An address given by Jadhak hiChna'el of the Clan of the Ebon Blade,
Eleventh Circle scholar priest of the Lord Sarku, upon the
inauguration of First Circle acolytes in the temple at Tleku, Thayuri
Isle.

Translated by David Chatterjee.

November 1995.

*****************************************************************************

Hail to you all, newly-honoured priests, and welcome to our sacred
Chamber of Glittering Night. You have made the first brave step on a
long and dangerous journey, and I salute you in the name of Our
Lord. May the masked demons of the Inner Paths of Ko'aar guard your
steps! May you not be swayed by the Thirteen Temptations, nor by the
Twenty-six Fears! Each of you is blessed by the Dark Hand of Despair,
and if only you pray to Him for the strength to serve Him as He
demands, you cannot falter.

All the formal rituals of your election to this most exalted of
priesthoods are now over. Try to relax: your new robes will be
uncomfortable at first, and your face paint seems strange on your
skin, does it not? Sit back, take a sip - I know you must be thirsty
after the Calling of the Names of Glory. Now before you join the other
priests as celebrants for the first time in the Mourning for the
Eternal Arch of Death, I want to spend a few moments talking to you as
a fellow traveller on your new journey. I want to point out a few of
the obscure signposts you will come across, to which perhaps you had
not really paid attention until now.

The worship of the Dread One of the Blackest Deeps is old within our
land. But it is an honour sought by a very few, and rejected - feared
even - by most of our fellows. Why is this? Is the Lord of Worms to be
feared? Why do we bow before Him in ecstasy if He is so terrible? Are
*we* to be feared? Do we don these robes in search of power, do you -
now that you wear them for the first time - feel a frisson of
excitement knowing that you are someone who will engender shudders in
the streets of our fair city as you go about your new business? Does
it make you feel important? Ask yourselves: these questions are vital
to your new life.

It is not shameful to face the truth about yourself: it *is*
dishonourable to hide from it; to avoid testing yourself for fear of
failure; to see your flaws and yet lack the courage to challenge and
defeat them. The Lord Sarku - may His Name be revered for all time -
is our guide and our strength, through this life and far beyond. He is
our God, and we must worship Him. But how, when we are nothing to Him?
What can we do that might remotely do honour to His name? Can a
Dra-ant praise his supernal glories? Can a field of yafa? Can a
mountain or an ocean wave sing of His excellence?

Cha, of course a mountain cannot even be aware of His devastating
reality. But can you? Ferruga, do you tell me that you, a lowly
acolyte, truly understand the nature of the Gods? Of course not! The
first commandment of any priest is inevitably this: to know
*himself*. To understand the true and eternal character of
existence. To purify himself, to see clearly, so that he might then
slowly begin to perceive what it is to worship his God.

So what is the "true and eternal character" of an individual? His
passions, his pedhetl, the Enemy that drives him from his chosen path
into fruitless meanderings, that dissipates into the raw power Between
the Planes upon his death? Is this really his innermost nature? Or his
dreaming shadow-self, his chusetl, that flits across the Planes and
vanishes like mist at death? His baletl, his spirit-soul that is
merely tarrying awhile with this sentient being and then passes on to
unknowable destinations beyond the Isles of the Excellent Dead, that
forgets the person of whom it once was a part? Surely these are
superficial aspects.

Then what of his physical body, his bakte, made of the same stuff as
chlen and dra, that falls away and rots? Perhaps this latter, since
with great arts we can preserve and re-invigorate the bakte; and the
veneration of the processes of decay and resurrection is a large part
of what the outsider perceives the worship of the Dark Lord of Undead
to entail.

But the flesh itself is nothing! - this is the vital first lesson in
understanding oneself. The conscious mind, the intellect, the alert
and true-perceiving eye, this fifth and final facet of a sentient
agent, his hlakme, this is the key to self-awareness and to
understanding the path towards piety and godliness. How can it be
otherwise? The hlakme is the one aspect of the individual that
survives death and remains a distinct part of the individual. With the
guidance of the Dark Lord we can return it from its dreamless sleep in
the tomb - still linked to the bakte, not dissolved nor forgetful - to
alertness and awareness and eternal freedom from the pettiness of
living shackled to the dreaming, angry, wandering selves. With our
mind finally clear from the veils we create around ourselves, we are
finally able to begin truly to understand the magnificence that is the
Lord Sarku, and to give praise to Him until the inevitable Triumph of
Chaos.

What then is the aim of the devout worshipper? To train his intellect,
to see clearly and calmly the falsehood of the shadows that flitter
across his mind - love, hate, ambition - so that he might more nearly
approach an understanding of his God, both before and after his death.

So should we fear death? No! It brings us closer to our
destination. We are alive for a handful of years cast into the night
like grains of dna. Is not then our death far more important than our
life? And who can guide us in death? You think you know the answer I
want, but you do not understand its import. Listen to the singers in
your clanhouses! Listen to the recitations in your temple! How many
times have you heard the Lament to the Wheel of Black? - and yet do
you grasp what it tells you? The Lord Belkhanu cannot help you: he is
merely the courier for the spirit-soul that once was a part of you but
now has nothing further to give you. The Grey Lord could do nothing
but watch as the early Gods fought; and in His weakness He could
become the Knower merely of Life. Then the mighty Lord Sarku was
become incarnate - and took His place opposite and beyond Thumis as
the Knower of Death!  Sarku is the Guide into Darkness, the One who
sees the skein of destiny of every entity on all the Planes, who holds
in His Hand the futures of all of us! The Lament to the Wheel of Black
even tells us that Lord Sarku alone was capable of defeating the
treachery of the Doomed Prince on Dormoron Plain - how could it be
otherwise, when only Our Lord holds all the pathways of life and
death? - who else could see Ksarul's Doom? - who else could confine a
God?

If all this is clear, then why should we be feared? The outsider sees our
emblems of decay, the icons of Siyenagga the Wanderer of Tombs; Zaidza
the Princess of the Liquescent Mould; Ku'un the Corpse-Lord. He pays
no heed to others of Our Master's Aspects: Chkorangtla the Shining
Pool of Envisionment; Tsapka'a the Devastating Wind that strips away
the cowardly lies and self-deceptions we array around ourselves;
Gonnqesha the Torch of Night who leads us into the Paradises of the
Tomb.

Those who gape and shudder and turn away are like the rabble crowds of
a hirilakte arena screaming for blood and violence. They enjoy being
aroused by sickening passions being inflicted between strangers. But
what about the true warrior who finds himself fighting for his life?
Should he be full of lust and rage? No! - rather, he must learn
through years of dedication to train not just his body but his mind,
to control his emotions, to view his opponent and the imminence of
death calmly so that he might fight sharply and precisely and
honourably without fear of failure or of shaming himself, his
ancestors, and his teachers.

We - you - are in an identical position. Ignore those who avoid you,
pity those who nerve themselves to approach you out of excited fear,
be patient with those who seek to understand. In the end, all of these
people will meet our Dread Lord: as will you. Honour Him and your
Church and your clan, and you can look forward to that meeting with
joy. A glorious future awaits you.

But do not think it will be easy. The facets of worship of Lord Sarku
that so fascinate outsiders are real, and they serve a purpose. Death,
decay, the corruption of the flesh, all this must be faced. You can
have no comprehension of what awaits you, and if I were to tell you
what is involved in the rituals of the Ravening Angel of Despair or
the High Surrender to Excrescence you would run screaming from this
room. How can we understand what comes beyond the Black Curtain
without staring into it until it falls back under the blazing force of
our will?

But - as with the warrior - the aim is not to run shrieking into the
arms of horror, but to train our mind to strong, calm contemplation,
to be able to focus without being distracted by our own passions or
those of others. To look ahead to whatever may befall us without fear,
disgust, excitement, or fury. How can we perceive the true glory of
Eternal Chaos that our Lord promises when we ourselves are awash with
dreams and shadows and falsehoods? How can we play our small part in
serving His plans? It would be unnatural if you were not apprehensive
and fearful along the way: when a young warrior faces his first naked
blade in training, and later his first hostile enemy, will he not
blanch? If such things excited him the way they excite his audience in
the arena, would we not think him sick of mind and unfit to fight?

To see clearly and not to flinch! What could be more honourable? But
this takes so many years of courage and faith: I hope and pray that
all of you will hold to the path and neither turn nor fall. Indeed, I
myself am only a little further along. We must help and support one
another through the arduous times ahead.

Enough; your initiations have been long, and I cannot explain all the
Mysteries of the Dark to tired young priests in a single kiren! Let us
move down to the Shattered Steps of the Opening Tomb for your first
ceremony as full clergy. None of you have yet seen this part of the
temple: I shall show the way.

>I have a question about the "Heresy of Chu'inur."  In MoG, Harsan quotes

All true, Sources and opinions differ widely. This is due to the
multiplicity of materials, data, theories, and arguments over the many
centuries. 


>Perhaps the reason for the failure of Chu'inur is that, like the
>Tinaliya diety, a monotheistic vision of God doesn't grant goodies and
>favors.

A monotheistic vision of God can indeed grant goodies and favours.
Christians, for example, believe that Christ fed the multitude with
loaves and fishes, brought the dead back to life, etc. -- which are
certainly "favours" and "goodies." God parted the sea for Moses. God
took the Holy Prophet Muhammad up to the highest heaven and vouchsafed
him knowledge and grace. Etc. 

Chu'inur failed because his "heresy" brought in other, unnamed deities
as prime actors in the saga of Dormoron Plain and the "alliance" of the
Gods to defeat Lord Ksarul. This did not sit well with the orthodoxy.
Chu'inur seems to have agreed that the deities of Pavar were
essentially *separate* entities, but he seems to have considered them
only a part of an ever-unfolding pantheon. He is thus in agreement upto
this point with the Salarvyani view of Avanthe/Dlamelish (Shiringgayi),
but he wanted to take it farther.

Not much else is known about this scholar.

No one knows exactly. Something about two intelligences joined as one who

Steven has a point. There are other *vampire-like* creatures on Tekumel.
They aren't the usual Count Dracula creatures famous in myth and movies,
but there are indeed beasties who suck blood and lifeforce.

>it's just a thought.

Put it all together, if you like. Some of it will ring true; other details
may differ just enough on close inspection to make a "match" impossible or
at least unlikely. Looking at Tekumel through the eyes of European
Chiristianity and mythology is not very productive because of the vast
cultural and linguistic differences. It has always been difficult for
Tekumel (per se) to become a mythos of itself and for itself; the world is
too unfamiliar; the correspondences do not always work. D-n-D, on the other
hand, is easily intelligible to American/European readers. The knights and
squires, dragons and elves, trolls and other monsters are all direct
carry-overs that any child can understand. A few more entities can be found
in the writings of Tolkien and others. A very few are unique but are
quickly internalised because they resemble and act like familiar beings.
Tekumel has no such obvious "build-ins," although less visible build-ins
are indeed present.

The *real* World of Darkness on Tekumel centres around the Pariah Deities
and those who follow them. You want something *truly* evil...? I try not to
go too deeply into these features.

Avanthe does not like the brazen use of her colour (medium blue) for the
eyes of persons who are not worthy. To her, *no one* is worthy of blue
eyes. A blue-eyed person is not likely to live long enough to reach
maturity, much less help in planting crops. Her devotees take her
prohibition very seriously.

With regard to the colors though: first, there's no reason to assume
that the visible disk of either moon is actually the surface, I seem to
recall both being described as possibly having at least tenuous
atmospheres; second, our current planetary surveys have shown us some
pretty unusual colorations for some of the moons in OUR solar system,
why not Tekumel's?  Here's a theory: maybe they were stockpiles of raw
materials for the Ancients?  Red==>iron oxides, green==>copper oxides?

As far as things Tekumelani are concerned, that is a very BIG assumption

"why would the ancients do that"?  Tekumel was a "resort" planet, no? 
They had the technology and apparently the desire to do such elaborate
things for purely estheic reasons: "it looks pretty that way" was more
than enough reason.

Gordon Neff adds...

Steve:

All -right-, ya wanna be pedantic, a circumpolar orbit would produce odd
effects. Now show me one, occurring naturally anywhere in the System.

I'll go ahead and concede most of this; how many angels, after all, -can-
dance on the head of a pin? The respective discussions are becoming disturbingly
similar.

Just in passing, though, it's impossible for I, who am 'confused,' to
resist asking:

...consider Earth's second moon (yes, we have at least 
two) which is a small asteroid discovered in 1986 designated 
3753. This moves in a strange orbit reminiscent of an 
bumble-bee on acid, with no simply defined eccentricity, yet 
is definitely gravitationally bound to the Earth. I see no 
reason why Gayel and Kashi could not have quite eccentric 
orbits.

And just how long, Master, d' ye suppose '3753' has BEEN THERE? Compared
to the Moon-- or the moons of Tekumel, for that matter...

Even I know that recently-captured objects do indeed zing around in wild
orbits... but they don't stay that way; either they impact their primary or
work, slowly, towards circularity.

And yes, I know about the Cassini Divide, thank you.

I think Mr Musielewicz really has the final word on this, though; his
suggestions of research sites appear exhaustive, and well worth pursuing.
('Orbital Planetary Defense Station'? I wouldn't have thought any such would
still be on orbit; it would have 'died the death of SkyLab' many millennia ago.)

Regarding all this moon-discussion, I can only say that "I pass." I tell
you what *I* see on Tekumel. I leave it to more learned physical scientists
than I to explain it. Wish I could do more, but I am no more responsible
for such details than the creators of Star Trek are obliged to use 20th
Century science  to explain how the transporter beams work.

Enjoy Tekumel for what it is, See if you can come up with something better.

I cannot say more.

[Moderator's Note:  William Nock asks some excellent questions about Combat ]
[                   magic and mages.                                        ]

>In formal warfare individual magicians are powerless due to the draining
>effect of combat magicians who work in teams of five.  This is my basic
>understanding and if it's wrong it may undermine a lot of my questions.
>(I'm a player not a GM.)

You're more or less correct. Large battles usually have contingents of
sorcerers attached to both armies. Individual magic might be used before
or after a battle (e.g. to heal important wounded), but during a battle 
the use of individual spells is practically impossible.

>What I'd like to know is:
>
>a)  Are combat magicians different to ordinary magicians, do they just have
>different training or different powers?

Combat magicians are trained to work together and combine their powers to
create very powerful spells. They are thus different from individual
sorcerers. The latter cannot just jump in and "help" a team of battle
magicians. Battle sorcerers may know a few individual spells, but they are
rarely trained in all the niceties of individual spell casting. The temples
quickly separate children who seem likely to become battle magicians from
regular priestly types, and their training is quite different. A lot of
teamwork and joint practice for the battle magicians, versus individual
training, courses on many subjects, and religious rituals, etc. for the
individual learners.

>b)  Are combat magicians always mutually negatory?  Or do they ever decide
>the outcome of battles?

No, but winning a battle with magic alone is very rare. The foot-sloggers
are still needed to go in and mop up. Also, battle magicians go into
trance-like states where they might not be able to detect and react to a
small contingent of enemy troops sent to find and destroy them.

>c)  What happens when an army with combat magicians meets one without?  Is
>the one without slaughtered?  If not is this because the other side hangs
>back?  If it does hang back what is the point in having combat magicians?

This has happened due to miscalculation a couple of times in history.
Usually the one without a contingent of sorcerers loses and flees or hides
behind fortified earthworks. Sometimes a determined bluff may convince a
foe to hang back -- e.g. if you have no combat magicians and yet pretend
that you do. A good general will reconnoitre carefully before committing
major units of his army, and a gang of soldiers attired in priestly robes
sitting far back up on a hillside can look like a very threatening magical
contingent. This worked once at the Siege of Mmillaka back in the 1300's.

>d)  How many combat magicians are likely to accompany any given army?  For
>example how many does Prince Eselne have under his command?  Dozens,
>hundreds, a few?

A couple of hundred is usually all that are needed for any individual
battle. Eselne has about 2-3 thousand available, as does Rereshqala.
Taksuru and Mirusiya have less, and Dhich'une's resources are not known.

Once Other Planar power is drawn through into Tekumel's Plane, it usually
stays active for some time. The length of time depends upon the strength of
the sorcerer, the deadening strength of the "Barren Area," and other
factors that are not too well understood. Thus, a sorcerer who "cocked" a
spell in Livyanu cannot expect it to work months later when he arrives at
the Tsolei Isles. The power just dribbles away, like an electric torch that
is left on for a long period. On the other hand, if one happens to cock a
spell just outside of a Barren Zone, then step inside and cast it, this is
usually likely to work. An Eye usually has one of its charges "cocked" and
hence can fire just once in a Barren Zone. Eyes are efficiently
preprogrammed to work within their constructed parameters, of course. They
don't "scatter," as do the spells of almost every living sorcerer, due to
loss of concentration, failure to visualise and use the patterns correctly,
etc. Even sorcerers with strong pedhetls occasionally fail.

Phil

Yah, well, I never liked 'crossovers' (a term used by the comic book
industry, if I recall; 'Capt Zip Meets Weenie-Man,' and who cares?) but it just
seems as though there OUGHT to be 'classic Undead' on Tekumel, just because so
much ELSE of magic, and magic-oriented elements, is present as well.

[                   them to appear in anyone elses, or in 'Real' Tekumel."   ]

I mentioned earlier, for example, the historical correlation between the
presence of iron, and the absence of magic--and how marvelously Tekumel 
exists in the exact opposite condition. Now, if THAT bit of classic 
thaumaturgy carries forward, -surely- there's room, somewhere, for 
'undead creatures who suck blood to survive, fizzle and smoke in the 
sunlight, turn into bats and fly around the room, get all upset when 
faced with garlic, and go bonkers when confronted by a cross...' as 
Message 479 described them.

[Moderator's Note:  Again, why?                                              ]

Now you -could- take the opportunity to clean off some of that, the bats
and such; that one will not bear even a moment's thought. (That'd be one Big,
Heavy Bat, no?)

>"Religious alignments would then become more sensible (no fear of crosses, but

Absolutely. If you recall the 1975 Empire of the Petal Throne rules, the
rules graft from... ah, that other TSR game... produced labels of 'Good' 
and 'Evil,' pasted on with no regard for fact or propriety. Okay-- but 
it's a pretty good bet that any creature 'oriented' to the Tlokiriqaluyal, 
or their Cohorts, is gonna at least -flinch-, when confronted by priests 
or artifacts of the Tlomitlanyal-- or -their- Cohorts.

Whilst editing Mitlanyal, Joe Saul was moved to ask...

"[please discuss] the relationship between the war temples and the
professional military (i.e. Legions)?  The role of these temples in society,
especially as regard the Legions, is not at all clear to me.  For example, my
understanding is that temple guard units rarely fight.  If so, how can the
priests of Karakan claim to actually be warriors, except in some symbolic
sense?  Wouldn't anyone truly interested in war as a lan activity sign up for
the best legion he could join?  And wouldn't he look down upon anyone who
serves in a mere temple guard unit?

"Or can officers of military legions also become lay-priests of
Karakan/Chegarra, join the honorary societies, get the martial training, and so
on?

"Maybe it's just me, but I am confused..."
----
Here is my response, but I'd like to hear what the professor has to say.
It is important to understand that in Tsolyani terms I am a "scholar priest,"
likely of Thumis, probably only of the second circle.  Hence military matters
hold almost no interest for me whatsoever, unlike many gamers.  Thus my 
analysis of temple-military relationships and my understanding regarding Joe's
question is limited.

As far as I know, the military in Tsolyanu is a uniquely hybrid beast:  the
military legions are wielded by the Imperium, but are supported and funded
by various combinations of the Temples, clans, and the local and imperial
treasuries.  

This balance prevents the military as a whole from gaining too much
independent power, and also prevents any of the Imperium, Temples and
clans from turning the military against any of the other groups.

But the military stands alone.  (Now this is where I get hazy.)  
Anyone can join any military legion, with some exceptions.  In some cases
the restrictions that exist are unwritten, such as a Sarku-worshipper
joining Red Devastation.  In other cases the restrictions are explicit:
no men will join Lady Dilinala's legion of lesbian warriors.  However,
one is generally free to join almost any legion.

If a young man or woman wishes to join a legion supported by Lord Karakan,
he or she may do so.  Even (hazy again) a youth whose family raised him as
a Sarku worshipper could join, although he would be well advised not to 
exhibit any but the most perfunctory interest in his family faith.

One could be a worshipper of Lord Karakan, then, but not be a priest of the 
temple, and hence not a temple guard.  You could join a Karakan legion,
see all sorts of wondrous battle action in the fields between Bey Su
and Avanthar, pray for victory in the temple, and be slain gloriously
by an illiterate lad from the Kurt Hills wielding a dull chlen-hide sword
who gets in a lucky shot.

Priests of the various temples may become military officers through 
personal effort (by studying as a priest before joining a military legion)
or by means of political and financial incentives.  High Administrative 
Priests may be appointed as Legion officers because of their adminstrative
skills and political acumen.  High Ritual priests are often appointed as the 
"Kerdu" of a legion, when in fact the legion is really run by their
experienced military adjutant, and they serve merely as the Temple
liason to the legion.  And in the Temple of Vimuhla, all the soldiery
are at least first-circle priests of the Temple, so that whole legions
are made up of "temple priests" who are also warriors.

What you probably WON'T find are mid-level soldiers who are also mid-level
priests.  To be a mid-level priest, one must live and work in the temple.
To be a mid-level soldier, one must bunk in the barracks.  Only at the top
where money, power and influence stir the mix will you find the "High
Ritual Priest of Karakan and Kerdu of the Legion of Blazing Glory," or 
such.

The temple guard of the various temples are (always? usually? sometimes?)
a branch of the ritual priesthood, of fairly junior station.  The grizzled
sergeant of the temple guard is probably someone of only moderate clan,
only moderate ambition, and only moderate intelligence and political skills,
hence their rather unphenomenal station in life.  But the Temple Guard are 
either ritual priests, or else clanspeople hired by the Temple for the duty.
These are not the same as military legion troops, and experience in
the temple guard is of only limited interest to legion recruiters -- sort 
of like the way a teenage job at McDonald's demonstrates one's ability to 
show up for work and not get fired, and that's all.

There are of course certain positions in the temple guard reserved for those
of particular skill, talent, intelligence and devotion.  These persons are
a cut above the second-circle "Opener of the Way of Bones" (Sarku Temple door-
guard), and would not mix with such.  These officers of the temple guard are
highly trained and serve to guard the Inner Sanctums, and the offices and
persons of the Inner Temple.  When one of the Temple Guards blasts an
invader with a blazing spell, then slices through four or five bravos
to turn back an incursion of player characters, that's the kind of officer
that they ran into.

I invite Professor Barker to shoot holes in this analysis, as it represents
only my limited experience with military matters in Tsolyanu.

A re-counting of an old battle where I first used Tekumel miniatures some
twenty years ago:

During the wars along the southern frontier, a noble contingent of Baron
Ald's army met with some truculent Tsolyani troops who presumed to interfere
with the Yan Koryani force rejoining its main body. After several duels were
fought, our noble leaders assured us we had won the advantage and ordered a
general attack. My unit of archers moved in unison with our fellows on the
right flank. We quickly came to a position overlooking the array of our
heavier forces to the center of the battle. As a Tsolyani center unit broke
in rout before our main troops, our commander made a surprising display of
courage and mystical insight and ordered that the unit should advance rapidly
across the flank of the enemy. In a scurry over broken ground, we became less
ordered than I would have liked...loosing sight of half the unit was
troubling...but we survived to reorganize on the...well, might I call it
"very extended" right wing of our forces. In fact, we emerged nearly half way
to the enemy rear! Realizing that the battle had started to reverse itself
and threatened to leave us desperately cut off from allies, our
certain-to-be-remembered leader ordered us to fire volley upon volley of
arrows into the enemy command area which was designated by a raised platform.


Now even a junior rank like myself knows that if you sting the enemy he may
very well swat you. This is what ensued. We saw the approach of the Tsolyani
flankers and medium troops led by a small contingent of Pei Choi. In the time
left to us we sent our last volley toward the command platform. And very like
all previous flights, these fell against the powerful battle magics of the
Tsolyani. Arrows rained down only to scatter in mid-flight...save a few which
struck generally among the colorful targets presented to us. Then we fled,
barely making the safety of our own lines as the Tsolyani made haste to cover
their own counter-attack. Our commander who-shall-be-remembered enobled
himself in the broken grounds as we scrambled to warn of the enemy approach.
Our next officer was well informed of this matter and is presently considered
a very prudent leader.

There are rumors which reached us after the battle which reassured us that we
had indeed conducted some action enobling our banner.  The last flight of
arrows, or what few actually made it through the magic barriers, struck home
among the high officers of the Tsolyani. In fact, it is rumored that several
arrows struck the person of the general himself, piercing his armor, and
delivering a killing wound. It is a nice story, we tell it a lot in the
camps. 

(the Professor was the adjudicator at this affair, and sure we pressed the
options as hard as possible.....for me, it was the beginning of several
battles of Quadardalikoi in which I fondly played the Yan Koryani
commander....and WON!...maybe next time I will remember enough of the great
fortress battle with three national armies convening...were any of you
there?)
