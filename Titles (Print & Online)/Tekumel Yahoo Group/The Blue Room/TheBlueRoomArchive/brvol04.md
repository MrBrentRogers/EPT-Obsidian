These messages are the accumulation of the messages that were sent out on 
the Blue Room email list between May 1995 and June 2000.  A large portion 
of the information is directly from Professor M.A.R Barker. When the list 
members joined during the time the list was active, they agreed to refrain 
from sharing this data with non list members.  When the list ended, it was 
urged that the data be made available to non-list Tekumel fans, and it 
seemed like a good idea all around.

I only ask that if you download these digests, or have received them in 
some other way, please respect the agreements the list members made, and 
refrain from passing them around and instead point people to the Tekumel 
web site, www.tekumel.com so that they can download them for themselves, 
and see all the other material available on the Tekumel.com web site.

Many Thanks.

	I think a useful reformatting for the original Sourcebook would 
be to do some cutting and pasting and reassemble it as a Gazeteer/

the browsing newcomer and more useful for referees trying to fill in 
details for their campaigns.

[Moderator's Note:  Bob Dushay adds on the Newcomers Guide.                 ]
Excellent additions to the proposed beginner's guide.  Now we have an 
outline.  Are there any people who think this would be a useful thing to
have written, and, second question, are there some people willing to write
sections of it?  I think it would be a very good thing to have.  If it's
short, we could pass it around at conventions.  If it's long, we may prevail
upon TOME to publish it and sell it--preferably for cheap, so all interested
players could afford it.

The Moon?  Which moon?  Gayel?

>unconscious.  What gifts should I send to make amends?

That depends upon his degree of umbrage, your relative clan levels, 
the relationship which exists between your clans, your relative temple 
affiliations, and your individual roles and natures.

If he is for example a bellicose member of a neutral or opposed faith 
(say he worships Shiringgayi and you worship Vimuhla), of unaffiliated 
clans, he might take umbrage and sue for shamtla, in which case he 
will request an amount and your clans will battle it out and you'll 
probably end up paying between 75 and 90 percent of what he asks.

If he is a reasonable man, of a clan with which yours has good, 
mercantile relations, of a related temple (Shiringgayi/Avanthe), and 
he is of equal stature as you, then you will probably beg each others 
pardon, protest that it was entirely one's own fault, and move on to 
other topics.

The only place I can see where you would "send" something might be if 
he was of a higher clan with which you wish to retain good relations, 
and he found it beneath his dignity to trouble you over the incident.  
You might send him something appropriate in the way of a gift to 
express your respect for his dignity, probably without mentioning the 
incident itself.  A bottle of fine wine and a willing young slave-girl 
or -boy (as he or she desires) to pour it might be suitable.

The professor will of course correct my perceptions if I'm off on this 
one.

>Emra hiGangassa asks:  If I find a cellar 15 metres below an area of swamp 
>that no-one owns, can I claim it and its contents under the Law of the 
>Present Hand?  What are the formalities?

Well, the Emperor "owns" it.  What did you find?  Depending on its 
value and the quality of the cellar, why do anything formal?  Haul the 
contents back to the clanhouse.  Or is this a tomb of some sort?  This 
needs clarification.

>Dzin, the lost Livyani girl, asks:  I was found adrift in a coracle after

I suspect not.

>Can I return safely alone, or 
>should I pay the pirate captain what he asks to return me to my home?

Pay?  What could you possibly have to pay with?  Oh.  I see.

Well, how attractive is he?  How grateful are you?

Depending on the circumstances, it might be safe for you to go home.  Most 
of Livyanu is under Mu'ugalvyani rule, but they can't be everywhere and the
south of Livyanu is pretty darned far south.  You might want to join 
the Livyani resistance if you return, or you might be captured, used, 
and slain by the Mu'ugalvyani (or captured, slain, and used, depending 
on the soldiers who capture you).

It's a tough call.  You're lucky the captain doesn't just enslave you and end
all your decisionmaking.  If you had surviving family and were of sufficiently
high clan, they might ransom you.

>Hinaz Vrimasu the trader of exotic foods and beverages asks: what is the

>import duties and forms to fill if I wish to import spirits and spices from

The rate of tax will vary from officer to officer depending on who 
meets you at the port.  The exact values can't easily be stated.
Suffice to say that you'll pay some percentage of the value of the 
shipment, between 5-30% depending on how well you and the officer get 
along.  It can't get too much worse than this without good reason:  if 
the officer takes too large a chunk of tax, the various clans which 
depend upon these goods will eventually get him out of the system, 
because he'll be annoying people and driving up prices.  If you screw 
it up and get caught trying to smuggle in goods or insult him with 
your behavior, he could have you arrested and your goods 
confisticated, but then your clan from the Foreigner's Quarters will 
complain to the Palace of Foreign Lands and to the Governor's Palace 
through a related or affiliated Tsolyani clan.  This assumes you're 
"somebody", and not just a shmuck on his first trading mission.
If you are saved from the stake by such measures, you'll probably owe
somebody a good piece of change.  If it was demonstrably not your fault
you might have less people annoyed at you, but they'll still wonder at your
inability to avoid trouble.

Uh, this one is complicated.  First off you don't WANT to use a spell if you
don't absolutely have to in order to defend yourself or someone from 
the slave.  It's about as bad an idea as firing a machine gun at a 
dinner party when a good flying tackle or call to the police will do.
If a slave were THREATENING someone with a brass candlestick, I mean 
really ready to just paste someone's skull, casting a big spell like 
that might be excused, but there are considerations:  that's a ritual 
spell (a temple ritual spell?) and the victim is pretty much going to 
be whonked at least once while you boogie the steps to the spell.  
Anyone concerned enough over what you're doing could poke you and 
prevent your getting the spell off successfully, or someone might 
inadvertently bump into you.  Remember, you're going to be standing 
there doing the "vogue" for a couple of seconds, each motion of which 
is crucial.

There are probably other spells which would be a better idea:  Radiant 
Gaze, for example.  I think it's psychic (I've never run a 
flame-priest) and it's eminently more controllable.  Domination is a 
great idea.  Even Translocation to dislodge the candlestick would be 
better advised.

What penalties might incur?  Well, a best-case scenario is where nobody
but you can save the day, you cast your bolt, it somehow wastes the slave
while not setting the house or the threatened guest afire, and you end 
up with a toasted slave, melted candlestick, and maybe a scorched rug.

Worst case?  You misperceive what the slave is doing (he's putting the 
candlestick on the table at the request of the guest), waste the 
slave, the guest, a couple of people behind them, the table, the 
tapestry, the wall and the house, but leave behind sufficient 
witnesses that your identity cannot be doubted.  This would be Very 
Bad.  Being sold into slavery so that your clan can pay the shamtla 
would be a definite possibility.  Impalement is possible depending on 
just who you toast, whose house it is, and all those clan/temple 
considerations.  In this case, being picked up in a coracle off the 
coast of Livyanu by a pirate captain might be a good idea.  And when 
he asks if you're a lost Livyani girl you look him right in the eye, 
smile, and say "Yes, I am".

Ooh, I'll leave those to the professor.  But priests of Sarku are

Another woman in addition to whom?  Dijaya?  I don't think your Kasi

Hmmm...  I suspect the answer is  "Yes, but it doesn't happen." 
Or maybe it does.  Why would a clan, even a "low" clan, want to surrender its
identity?  Even the lowest clans have pride in their station.

Should such a thing occur, I suspect that after a couple of generations the
merged clan would be considered homogenous by its members.  Things would be 
kinda iffy for the first few decades, tho.  Who sits on how many mats when 
you're all at dinner?  Do the newly-adopted members get to sit equal to
the previous members?  Not likely, I suspect.  I'll be interested to see
the answer.

>Midori Ito asks:  If Hirkane Tlakotani was the 'stone upon whom the 
>universe rests', and Mirusiya would have been 'the flame that illuminates 
>the world', what is Dhitchune's honourific?

I see our Honoured Moderator has answered your question about Dhich'une's 
throne name. The custom of "throne names" has not always been followed, but 
many Tsolyani rulers have insisted on it and have chosen names that they 
hope will reflect their political positions and places in history.

>Also, I tried to bow heads 
>when the Salarvyani ambassador visited the Palace of the Moon last week, 
>but we collided (apparently their etiquette is different) and I knocked him 
>unconscious.  What gifts should I send to make amends?

A nice bottle of black Salarvyani Dronu wine (vintage 2354 is good, but 
expensive) might do the trick. A note of apology is mandatory, of course, 
and you might consider offering him one of your wives or a concubine for 
the night, if he is interested. Usually, the Salarvyani don't take accidental 
breaches of etiquette too seriously. If he is interested in hunting or 
falconry, an invitation to go along on a party migt be nice, too.

>Emra hiGangassa asks:  If I find a cellar 15 metres below an area of swamp 
>that no-one owns, can I claim it and its contents under the Law of the 
>Present Hand?  What are the formalities?

All land in the Tsolyani Empire belongs first to the Emperor. There is 
thus no land that "no one owns." Not to worry -- unless you find something 
so vital to the Imperium that the Chancery decides to claim it. In that 
case, you would probably be visited by interested parties from other Princes, 
from various temples, a few foreign powers, and maybe a nonhuman race or two. 
If the swamp is on the land of a clan or fief or temple, of course, it 
belongs to them as secondary claimants after the Imperium. If this is none 
of the above is the case, you can certainly claim it by filing for it at 
the Palace of the Realm in the city that is the local capital of the province 
in which it exists. A provincial map was published, I believe, in one of the 
two volumes of the Sourcebook. (Don't remember the citation...?)

>Dzin, the lost Livyani girl, asks:  I was found adrift in a coracle after 
>fleeing my village on the southern Livyanu coast during the plague three 
>years ago.  Is my aunt Mlilin still alive?  Can I return safely alone, or 
>should I pay the pirate captain what he asks to return me to my home?

Your Aunt is alive. Although you knew her by the pet name of Mlilin, her 
real name is Mlileb, and her lineage is fairly high: the Arkhuo family 
of the Interwtwined Flowers clan. Your village is 34 Tsan north of the 
city of Yro in hex 1625 of the old map: a small fishing port on the 
mountainous coast. Do NOT trust the pirate captain: a lot of Livyani 
children have been sold into slavery after the Plague. Some have been 
passed on to the Temple of Hrsh in Mu'ugalavya for sacrifice, while others 
now suffer horrors in the temples of Hrihayal in southern Tsolyanu. Get 
married to some prosperous Livyani citizen in exile, who will protect and 
help you. Even if you are legally an Aridani, it is hard to manage alone 
in these troublous times! A Tsolyani noble might help, too, but there 
would be less sympathy -- and a possiblity of being sold into slavery or 
worse, as well.
 
>Hinaz Vrimasu the trader of exotic foods and beverages asks: what is the 
>current rate of tax on Tsuhoridu and similar items?  Are there any other 
>import duties and forms to fill if I wish to import spirits and spices from 
>Salarvya and Livyanu to Jakalla?

Imperial Tsolyani taxes are paid at the source when an item is first 
produced.  The factory adds this on to the price it charges a transport 
clan or a middleman who buys the item for sale at a shop or to take to 
another location. The Imperium usually charges between 5% and 20% by 
volume on Tsuhoridu, depending on hos much the factory is willing to 
pay in bribes to the tax collectors. The factory then charges a profit 
of about 15% when they sell it, to which the Imperial tax is added. You 
can then resell it at about 75% - 150% more than its original production 
cost. but you must include your transport costs, slaves, Chlen carts, 
guards, salespeople, shop rental, etc. You may thus realise a final profit 
of perhaps 25% - 40% more than you paid for it. No fixed figures can be 
given because of because of the costs of bribes to officials, market police, 
Sakbe road officers, etc. Additionally, there may be problems of supply, 
seasonal difficulties in the processing of Tsuhoridu, labour problems, and 
the like.

There are forms, of course, which is a nice way of paying the requisite 
bribes:  "How much does a license cost...?" Bargaining is mandatory; 
otherwise you won't be in business long! The Plague in Livyanu has 
curtailed (but not completely cut off) the trade in Livyani goods, 
and the Salarvyani incursions into southern Tsolyanu, the Gilraya Forest, 
and their seizure of Fenul and Ru, have made it hard to get Salarvyani 
products -- some ships have been seized, and Salarvyani merchant caravans 
have been looted.

You can do whatever you like to a person who is legally a slave and has 
no contract or other rights. Social pressure usually prevents any but 
the most callous and cruel owners from torturing or killing slaves -- 
as does economic pressure! Slaves cost money, and unless you are trying 
to make a point, it is not a good idea to slaughter them casually. Having 
the slave removed and privately punished is perhaps better, but you owe 
apologies to the guest because it was your property that caused the insult. 
Running away is not an option, if you have status, position, a family, a 
business, etc. You will have to pay Shamtla, depending on the status and 
wealth of the guest you hit. It's hard to state just how much -- clans can 
demand anything. Your own clan should step in, however, and bargain for you.
 
>Zorel hiSsayeti, port official, Pala Jakalla:  Who is my ultimate superior 
>officer, who runs the OAL now, and why do all these people in brown robes

You are responsible to Nenue hiQolyelmu, 54 years old, of the white Stone 
Clan, the Chief Port Officer in Jakalla at the Palace of the Realm there. 
She is dignified, pleasant, reasonably honest, and loves to buy expensive 
mechanical toys for her 3 grandchildren. She is married to Jarash 
hiQolyelmu, who is Chief Scribe in charge of Customs and Marine Affairs. 
Both worship Avanthe and are rather worried that they'll be replaced by 
Dhich'une's sycophants. No one knows who Dhich'une has put in as Chief 
OAL officer in Avanthar right now, and the post in Jakalla is vacant
 
>Mazaholza hiNiriuna, Aridane and Legion of Blue Kirtle:  what is the recent

>I take another woman as a lover?

Don't you mean _Sapphire_ Kirtle? Did I make a mistake? "Blue" is /nirin/, 
which implies a royal blue (sky blue?); the gem "Sapphire" is /paletl-ikh/, 
and the adjective for a deeper, richer blue is thus /paletlin/ (accent of 
the /e/).

Your legion fought in the war with Yan Kor under Prince Eselne, taking 
part in the siege of Kai. It was then reposted to Chene Ho, where it was 
ordered south to fight for Eselne in the present civil war. Rather 
unwillingly, Lady Dijaya obeyed, and her troops fought at Si'is and Komore 
before being added to Eselne's garrison at Mrelu. Lady Dijaya is still 
alive and well (reports of her death in battle proved erroneous), and 
she continues to pressure Eselne toward a negotiated peace, with the goal 
of an eventual Kolumejalim in which all candidates could participate. 
Prince Rereshqala has sent her private messages to pass on to Eselne to 
this effect, and she has done so.

As for taking another lover, as long as you are Aridani, you have the right 
to choose whom or what you will sleep with. Unless you are sleeping with 
your Kasi, who would then take personal umbrage if you left, you are free 
to do as you wish. Enjoy!

No proper high clan would consider taking a small clan into its mem-
bership -- its public reputation would collapse! No amount of money 
or private sleeping around could bring this about! Suruna may be given 
money, lands, a clanhouse of his own, etc. by his master's clan, but 
getting his small clan adopted into a higher clan is pretty remote. 
Individuals do get adopted, particularly if they do things that would 
gain the clan respect and reputation, but a whole small clan? Hmm. 
Social climbers seem to abound where you come from...

Hope this helps. I can't micromanage all of the Tekumel campaigns out there, 
but once in awhile I may be able to help.

Sounds good to me: reformatting and cutting and pasting -- and chopping 
some of my turgid academic prose -- sounds good. I was just speaking to 
Ed Winmble of TOME, and he opined that they may still want to do vol. 
3 of the Sourcebook and republish vol. 2 which is more or less out of 
print. Vol. 1 they still have in stock. They may want some new material 
for the republication of vol. 3. I am considering what might be most 
interesting and useful. 

Let me note that I hold the copyrights on nearly everything that has 
been done on Tekumel, and no one can approach TOME and offer a project 
that bypasses my eagle eye for Tekumel authenticity and quality. Some 
have tried, but TOME passes such proposals on to me, where I can either 
encourage them or say that this won't do for Tekumel. I insist that names, 
places, and other cultural data be "authenticated," and I also insist that 
new characters, objects, and other creations be passed on to me for 
"authentication" and the not inconsiderable problem of fitting them into 
Tekumel's mythos. Sorry, guys! No blonde Valkyries in Jakalla!

At this point, Bob, I think you might want to call TOME and talk to Ed 
Wimble.  He is thinking of publishing vol. 3 after all, but if somebody 
wants to rewrite the Sourcebook and bring it up to date, we can get some 
new art for it, and Ed sounds favourable to publishing it. Ask the 
Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, operator for TOME's number.

Chris is right. If TOME can't do it, or wants to do something else, 
then we could still put up some kind of brief source material on the 
Blue Room FTP site.  I'm up for that.

_<I>_ said to drop the English style spellings??? I must have been 
asleep, Chris! I always urge English spellings because I happen to 
favour them as a way to maintain honour and promote true civilisation! 
But it's no big deal -- just the way I learned to spell when I worked 
at McGill University on Montreal, Canada. My superior there was an old-
style Canadian, who insisted that everything I wrote had to be spelled 
"correctly." If you want to spell the American way, at least that's a 
major improvement over some of the spellings I used to get on term papers 
when I taught at the university here!

Bob is essentially correct, although the gifts and polite note I mentioned 
in my response are still good ideas.

You're exactly right, but more "etiquette" is required than in our various 
societies here on Earth. Note that Bob suggested the very same gifts I did.

Not so odd. The Emperor's favourites are all over the place, confiscating, 
pressuring, and pushing. The Imperium in Avanthar is short of cash since 
the civil war has blocked the payment of taxes, destroyed some crops, 
and forced most funds to be used for military purposes.

As I said, this doesn't happen -- oh, maybe once in a red or green moon... 
The questions about etiquette within the newly constituted united clan 
would be just horrendous, especially if the little clan were truly lower 
than the larger one in status. I'll have to ask Kagor -- he's one of the 
most knowledgeable major domos I know.

[Moderator's Note: Steve Foster provides some optional answers to David's  ]
[                  questions.  We can tell that his contact must enjoy     ]
[                  being the center of requests for Shamtla.   :)          ]

I have a been in contact with Kanmi'yel hiBashlatoi, a lay priest of 
Vimuhla, wine "connoisseur", authority on Mihalli and "archaeologist" of 
note, who once briefly met Midori Ito and was able to offer his own advice:

>Midori Ito asks:  If Hirkane Tlakotani was the 'stone upon whom the 
>universe rests', and Mirusiya would have been 'the flame that 
>illuminates the world', what is Dhitchune's honourific?  

"The Maggot Upon Whom the Turd rests", I say and the OAL be damned!

A Salarvyani, eh? Might I suggest a few stout lads with scythe handles, and 
make sure they bring back shamtla for the damage to your hat!

>Emra hiGangassa asks:  If I find a cellar 15 metres below an area of 
>swamp that no-one owns, can I claim it and its contents under the Law 
>of the Present Hand?  What are the formalities?

In my experience of these situations, it is usually quite easy to determine 
the owner and to negotiate as follows: "Back to your charnel pit, grave 
spawn! Try and Vermiculate me will you? Let's see how you like a Fist of 
Fire up the Pine Post Hole!"

>Dzin, the lost Livyani girl, asks:  I was found adrift in a coracle 
>after fleeing my village on the southern Livyanu coast during the 
>plague three years ago.  Is my aunt Mlilin still alive?  Can I return

Speaking as a veteran traveller, my advice is as follows: You should stand 
erect, stare straight ahead, make clockwork ticking-type noises and say "A 
one way ticket to Nga, please, <bzzz> good sir. <bing> My assignment is 
complete. That makes <whirr> an even hundred this year and it's <bong> still 
only Firasul." I think you'll have little trouble from the pirate.

>Hinaz Vrimasu the trader of exotic foods and beverages asks: what is 
>the current rate of tax on Tsuhoridu and similar items?  Are there any 
>other import duties and forms to fill if I wish to import spirits and 
>spices from Salarvya and Livyanu to Jakalla?

I suggest you contact Drusan hiBarankoi at the Jakalla excise office and 
mention that you are a friend of his esteemed wife, but that didn't look 
like her that he was with at the winemaker's clan yesterday. You should 
emphasise that you were a great fan of his wife during her Dzor-wrestling 
days in the arena.

I have in fact been in this situation while at dinner with my acquaintance, 
and fellow sorcerer, Arsemkoi Jadhak hiVriddi. As I recall, events after the 
spell went like this: "Dashitall to the Xanthic Hells, Jadhak! Why'd you 
have to duck like that? I've toasted m' slave, set fire to the bandage on 
the Cardinal's gout and the scorch marks from the damned Duchess won't ever 
come out of that rug." I recommend a brief holiday to Du'un soon afterwards.

>Zorel hiSsayeti, port official, Pala Jakalla:  Who is my ultimate 
>superior officer, who runs the OAL now, and why do all these people in 
>brown robes want me to pass 'fines' to them?

Well, young Zorel, it so happens that I have the esteemed post of head of 
the OAL now. Of course I'm undercover, and you shouldn't mention my identity 
to anyone - Imperial secrets and all that. Now if you'll just be so good as 
to show me your collection today....

>Mazaholza hiNiriuna, Aridane and Legion of Blue Kirtle:  what is the 
>recent history of my legion, after the Deeds of the Ever Glorious?

I seem to recall that Dijaya hiQurruluma discovered an ancient learning 
sphere from which she gleaned some new ways of making building materials. I 
understand that she is currently doing rather well in the cement business.

Dashitall! Damned lower classes are getting too big for their boots! A clan 
which lets every Thomar, Dhichune or Hirkane become a member won't stay high 
status for very long! My advice to Suruna is to take a long vacation in the 
Tolek Kana Pits where he might come to a better understanding of his 
position in society!


Well, I hope the communication from my friend have helped by giving the 
position of the average high-clan sorcerer-in-the-street.

[Moderator's Note:  Alex makes some good points about the Newcomer's Guide, ]
[                   and I'll add some news about it as well.                ]

>Sounds good to me: reformatting and cutting and pasting -- and chopping 
>some of my turgid academic prose -- sounds good. I was just speaking to 
>Ed Winmble of TOME, and he opined that they may still want to do vol. 
>3 of the Sourcebook and republish vol. 2 which is more or less out of 
>print. 

I think the third volume of the Sourcebook is really a logically distinct
entity from the proposed primer. What do you think Bob, this primer concept
was originally suggested by you? I think the idea of subsuming the primer
project into a third volume of the sourcebook will encounter the following
sorts of problems:

1. Purpose dilution: the idea of the primer is to entice newcomers to
Tekumel, the purpose of the source book is to provide a much deeper level of
detail. These are not really coextensive goals.

2. Publication costs: putting out a nicely typeset document on the internet
is next to free, publication through TOME would encounter a whole set of
economic factors that we could probably do without.

3. Usefulness: the primer would be a relatively self-contained entity,
whereas a "vol.3" of the sourcebook would fall into the TOME marketing
vortex -- i.e. selling bits and pieces to a marketplace that wants a concise
and integrated product. Gamescience almost did it right, selling an
integrated, complete sourcebook, player rules, and (the never publsihed)
referee rules. What is really needed is a small "glossy brochure" touching
on the important features of Tekumel -- sort of a visitor's guide to
Tsolyanu/Tekumel. 

Are we in danger of blowing the scale of this proposed primer out of
proportion? I really liked the idea of 6-8 page primer distributed through
the Blue Room ftp site - what is now being discussed sounds like too much
work with little purpose (aside from the republication of material out of
print since 1983). It also introduces the independent variable of TOME and
its financial willingness to procede with this sort of document.

[Moderator's Note:  The Sourcebook revival is now a separate project.  Bob ]
[                   Dushay has offered to spearhead the Newcomer's Guide   ]
[                   project, and the Professor supports it as a separate,  ]
[                   new work, and will approve it as real Tekumel when it  ]
[                   is complete!   Great News, and great ideas, everyone.  ]

I would be happy to edit and write (a portion) of the primer - but I would
like to see the scale remain small and useful (for neophytes to Tekumel). No
one outside of the Tekumel converted is going to be interested in reading
the third volume of a major anthropological guide to Tekumel cold -- you
first need to hook them with intriguing tidbits about Tekumel -- languages,
social customes, the mixture of technology and sorcery, rich historical
background, etc.

>Let me note that I hold the copyrights on nearly everything that has 
>been done on Tekumel, and no one can approach TOME and offer a project 
>that bypasses my eagle eye for Tekumel authenticity and quality. 

Professor, would you be willing to perform editing of the final primer - to
ensure the "authenticity" you mention? Preliminary work could be done by
others, with you being the final "filter" of the material.

[Moderator's Note:  See above note.  The Prof is on board for this project. ]

Stupendous thanks for the answers, everybody.  I'll wait about a year 
before keeping you all up late again, maybe :)

Bob asked about the Palace of the Moon, his reply is fine as it is so there 
is no need for further detail, but the 'Palace' is a large country house on 
the river about twenty tsan from Jakalla.  It was owned by Jadthek hiVriddi 
until he ran short of cash supporting Mirusiya.  He then sold it to Midori 
Ito for a vastly inflated price, incidentally forgetting to mention the 
subsidence, wandering Tsoggu problem, swamp fly infestation and the sunken 
barge full of forbidden books just off the quay.  Midori kept the name of 
the 'Palace', knocked down half the east wing and is currently trying to 
find a buyer!

I'll pass the fantastic ideas on, in game, to the players over the next 
week.

I will sacrifice a few handfulls of beetles and gems in your honour!

If TOME are still thinking about reprinting the sourcebook, and are open to
more tekumel, does that mean that Gardasiyal sold sufficiently well?  How do
TOME feel about Tekumel at the moment?

Dear Roger,

I don't have a clue. TOME is now muttering about publishing vol. 3 of the 
Sourcebook, but vol. 2 is out of print, and they only have some of vol. 1 in 
stock. They don't want to publish my little booklet on the Sunuz language, and 
they keep discussing vol. 3 without ever seeming to come to a conclusion.
 
I have NO idea how Gardasiyal is selling.

Great replies! Unfortunately, some of your proposed solutions would get 
you hung out to dry on one of the local impaling stakes! If only my 
players would take Tekumel as seriously as you do, we could spend more 
time rolling up new characters and starting new scenarios, instead of

Who are you calling cautious and boring?  Let me remind you what is going on.
 
We are a group of low level (5-6) medium to high clan "youngsters" who
are now hip deep in some of the worst crud we have ever had thrown at us.

Let's start with the inheritance of a Ssu/Demon/Salarvyani infested haunted 
fief of which we now have tenuous claim to at best.  Throw in enough people
from different temples to start a holy war, then add a demon convention, no
make that a demon resort, then throw in a temple that not only has a doorway
that scares the bejeezus out of a quasi mythical group called the HoruKangai,
but has a door that opens into the planes beyond at certain unspecified 
times, stir in a couple of kids that are millenia old and travel the planes 
in a way that we have never seen and then, just for fun, make it so there 
is an iron mine that everyone wants to get their hands on.  Oh yeah, and a 
tower that "looks" at you.  I think I have covered all the bases.   Now that 
I have refreshed your memory, remind me again how boring and cautious we are.

>>1.  Have you ever put together a calendar of significant events by temple 
>>and city?

This is part of the mythical Temple book that I'm working on.  Each 
God and Cohort has its holidays listed towards the end of the 
chapter.  Often these celebrations are significant only in one or a 
few cities, and when this is the case it is noted.

>> (Does every aspect of every God have their own festival?

Not really.  At one time or another, in one place or another, various 
Aspects are important and unimportant.  An aspect of a given God can 
be revered in one city, but in another city the priests hold that this 
aspect isn't really an aspect at all, despite the overall Temple's 
acceptance.

>> Which Emperors birthdays are honored?

Usually only the birthday of the current Emperor, and the day of his 
or her accession to the throne are celebrated.  Certainly older folks 
might continue to hold private celebrations on the birthday of the 
emperor who ruled in their youth and who they admired, but the nation 
only observes celebrations of the current Emperor.  Currently Tsolyanu 
is NOT celebrating the birthday or accession day of Emperor Squish'une.
It would probably inflame the conflicts already underway in the Empire.

Yes, they are.  Having sorted through them, culled them by temple and city
and combed them out into each temple, I can tell you that that brief calendar
holds a lot more information than is initially evident.  It took me several
weeks to get through it all.

>Only those in the Sourcebook have been written down. Other nations? No, I 
>don't think I ever put together a list of their holidays.

This is why the Temple book is taking so long (among other reasons).  

No, the Professor has not made up a formal list of holidays in other 
nations.  BUT in every article, story, or rulebook he has written, he 
has MENTIONED these holidays.  A hint here, a clue there.

While I will be the first to admit that it is difficult to find time 
to work on the Temple book while simultaneously conceiving and 
raising three children all within 3.5 years of age, the process of 
assembling the Temple book is a research project of massive 
proportions.

There ARE holidays in other nations -- from the coming-of-age rituals 
of the N'luss to the sword-dances of the states of the Northeast to 
the Celebration of the Cruel Jest of Kikumarsha in Livyanu,
information about these festivals is sprinkled throughout Professor 
Barker's writing like chocolate chips in a loaf of banana bread (sorry 
about the metaphor: I'm hungry this morning).

Finding them, and translating a casual mention from a line of dialogue 
into a statement of fact placed in proper context is a slow, 
painstaking and tedious process.  And all the while, Phil is writing 
new stuff:  I finish constructing the Dlamelish chapter and find that 
he has written an article on the Sunuz Language of the Pariah 
Deities.  Well, THERE is at least two or three more months (at the 
pace I am able to work) of sorting and cataloguing in that, and I 
haven't even finished culling all the Shadow God references from the 
unfinished and equally-mythical 26 chapters of the third novel!

Sorry about the rant here, but you struck a nerve with your question!

>>3.  What would be some of the significant religious and life events for the

Part of the problem with the Enemies of Man is that we never get 
invited to their parties, or if we do we never leave to tell about it.
Certainly they have rituals and behavior, but part of the reason that 
they ARE the implacable Enemies that they are is because communication 
with them is next-to-impossible.

It is entirely possible that their values and views are so different 
from ours that the idea of a "celebration" makes no sense to them.  
That the concept of a "year" is meaningless (if you live underground, 
hm?)  That the idea of "good times", "fun", "bad times", and "hard 
work" are completely useless.  That "feast" and "famine" are 
unconceptualized:  there either is food to eat or there isn't.  Many 
of the values that lead to human celebrations may not be part of the 
Enemies' worldviews at all.

I have a few comments on Bob Alberti's interesting responses and points
raised. Nothing I say should be viewed as "official", just my spin on some
of these issues. I hope this stimulates discussion.

>Not really.  At one time or another, in one place or another, various

I have a small question in this regard: How much chronological tracing have
you done for the various aspects? For example, what are the roots of the
/Enome/ aspect of Lord Ksarul - are they Livyani, Bednalljan, Llyani, etc?
Will this sort of genalogical approach be used in the Temple Book? I am very
interested in the connexion of Shadow Gods to the proto-Engsvanyali Deities,
could you say a little more on this topic?

>Part of the problem with the Enemies of Man is that we never get 
>invited to their parties, or if we do we never leave to tell about it.
>Certainly they have rituals and behavior, but part of the reason that

Surely not next-to-impossible, just impracticable, right? They hate us and
want our Humanspace terraforming-asses off Tekumel -- this does not
logically imply the impossibility( or near-impossibility) of communication.
Not /wanting/ to talk to someone is not synonymous with not being /able/ to
speak with them. 

<rant>
I just don't buy linguistic relativism at all -- all concepts can be
"communicated", just not necessarily with a one-to-one mapping (isomorphism)
between language/conceptual systems. All the discussion that we have had
about this sort of  "cultural relativism" (remeber the exchanges between
Sandy Peterson and Professor Barker about the Ssu earlier?) seems to forget
this one point: we are much closer in our customs and ideas than we are
apart. Values do seem to transcend political and ethnological boundaries is
interesting and (sometimes) predicable ways. I am much more interested in
delineating those points of agreement than in dwelling on some cultural or
linguistic details. We have what 300+ langauges spoken on earth, yet most of
the speakers share similar conceptual frameworks as regards to "parsing" our
world (color words, spatial relations, temporal concepts, etc. Yes, some
Terran languages have multiple words for snow, while other only have a few
(or none) -- this does not imply the impossibility of inter-representation
of physical descriptions between speakers of these languages. At the very
least, they could agree that it is the same denotative entity being
discussed (the actual snow). Our "parsing" of physical phenomena appears to
transcend the linguistic/cultural apparatus. 

Oh well, theoreticians differ on this. I could be totally off-base with
this. The political climate in this country (USA) seems geared toward
partialization and exaggeration of heterogeneity among ethnic and social
groups- and we probably are seing this reflected in the "Tekumel optic" as well.
<off>

The Ssu-Human interaction is a case in point -- I am willing to bet that we
and they share much more of our conceptual frameworks then we do not. The
assimilation of mathematical ideas by the Greeks from their neighbors -- who
had totally different cultural values/religious ideas/social systems is an
old-Terran example of this. Japanese co-opting of the Chinese Kanji as a
basis of their written semiotic system is another. The ready assimilation of
Humanspace technology (and continued interest in this technology)into their
(Ssu) cultural system(s) intimates that this is the case. All those Ssu
exploratory parties exploring the Tsuru'um beneath the Tekumelani cities,
looking for ancient technology...they certainly do seem to share many of our
interests.

Well, excavations and archaeological evidence from abandoned Ssu sites
(there should be plenty of those scattered over the surface of Tekumel - I
am thinking of the old Ssu capitol/fortress that the Salarvyani overran in
the age of the Fishermen Kings - is it Ssuganar??!) might indicate a great
deal of circumstantial evidence for votive/festive structures. I remember
visiting the site of Ancient Thira on Santorini a few months ago (yes, I was
slumming in the Greek Isles) -- it was remarkable how much was pieced
togther about this Minoan city and the customs of its inhabitants just from
architectural and decorative motifs. Arrangements of rooms, size, artifacts
(not just the technological kind), etc. Perhaps this sort of indirect
information would provide a basis for "learning" about the Ssu (and Hluss).
Maybe not. What do you think? First hand accounts are not the only (or even
PRIMARY) way that we have knowledge about our own ancient "earth" cultures,
so this might not really be a stumbling block...

>It is entirely possible that their values and views are so different 
>from ours that the idea of a "celebration" makes no sense to them.  

Hmmm, I wonder. Certainly what the Ssu would celebrate might be radically
different from the average Tsolyani (like the celebration of sacrificing and
consuming Tsolyani captives), but these species are highly intelligent - in
fact, they have better knowledge of the "old technologies of Humanspace"
than the current human inhabitants! It would seem unlikely that they would
not have a concept/social idea of /celebration/ - even bees have their
little "dances" in the hive - and these are creatures with extraordinarily
primitive nervous systems (when compared to organisms such as human beings
-- and Ssu).

>That the concept of a "year" is meaningless (if you live underground,

Again, secondary information from Ssu "sites" seems to militate against this
sort of thing - well, at least on my reading. They have languages (semiotic
systems) - which indicate a highly evolved communication paradigm. In that,
they are completely like the "starfaring races" - employing written
communication to convey important ideas, historical events, etc. Remember
all those circles and dots found at abandoned Ssu dwellings/cities? Couple
this with a decent understanding of advanced technology -- and I think you
get a species a great deal closer to "us" (as Tsolyani) than we would care
to admit. This is the process of cross-fertalization -- the Ssu absorbing
technologies, ideas, etc. from the vile "Demons from the Sky", and this
fertalization changing the cultural development of the Ssu, perhaps in
subtle, almost inchoate ways. This intermingling has been going on for,
hmmm, 60,000 years (rough guess from the sourcebook period ranges) -- I
think its safe to assume that "our" concepts have penetrated the Ssu
conceptual framework (or been there all along...). The Ssu of 60,000 years
ago mgiht have difficulty recognizing their descendents on present day
Tekumel - or not much trouble at all - depending on how much of their
conceptual framework you believe was native and how much as assimilated by
contact with the Humanspace "invaders". Remember, Ssu society has continued
to evolve and change just like the Humanspace-descended societies -- they
haven't just been "biding their time" -- they are an evolving species on
Tekumel.

<editorializing mode on>

I prefer to view the aboriginal lifeforms of Tekumel witha bit more
sympathy, if that is the right word, than is often given them. Often, they
are depicted as "wholey Other" - nothing like us, etc., etc. But is this
really the case? Aren't they a lot more like us (Humanspacers) than we care
to admit -- employing sophisticated technologies, having religions,
utilizing written and spoken langauges, able to master the "sorcery"
available in Tekumel's pocket dimension, etc? I like viewing them as foes,
yes, but also with a bit of, dare I say it, "humanity" - possessing a tragic
dimension (i.e. being relegated to third-class scum on their own planet).
After all, having your planet taken from you by Ape-descendents and Stick
insects (Pe Choi) could make anyone sore... As intelligent and sophisticated
foes the Ssu make much more interesting fodder for the Tekumel simulation
than just generic bad guys encountered in the catacombs underneath Purdimal
and Jakalla (or in Pechano), acting "wholey Other", and totally "inimical".
Just my two cents.

<editorializing complete> 

This raises a question, Mr. Alberti, that I have never been able to answer:
If the Ssu had primitive spaceflight capabilities -- why aren't they using
them now? Surely they don't construct the ships out of that Food of the Ssu
stuff? Why haven't they ever exploited this? Or have they? They obviously
didn't require as much /metal/ and materials science -- since they were
happily building their craft well before the advent of Humanspace
terraformers. There is no indication anywhere that the Ssu sufferd the same
type of cultural retardation that plagued the Humanspace colonists -- in
fact, they probably liked it better when the "stars went out" - their
technology was purely terrestrial (i.e. fashioned from the material of
Tekumel, not imported from Acturus or whereever) and hence not subject to
the "limitations" of the Humanspace technology (running out of batteries,
lack of spare parts, etc.) As aboriginals, they would have had knowledge of
material manufacturing that was not limited to the imported alloys and
metals brought by the Colony ships. Anyone have an idea?  

Good luck with the temple book, I look forward to seeing it. It must be a
rather daunting task!

While the common characteristics and possible common roots for Shadow 
Gods/Pavar Pantheon Gods is discussed, the book will not explore these 
roots to any great degree.  The book is intended as a game supplement 
for characters playing within the present-day system and will concern 
itself with more day-to-day things as "When I arrive in Tumissa on the 
3rd of Firasul at noon, will there be a big ritual taking place in the 
Temple of Vimuhla?"  There is so much material to cover (e.g. 
Temple-clan and Temple-political alliances, Temple structure and 
layout, rituals, etc) that real "genealogy" will be limited.

> I am very
>interested in the connexion of Shadow Gods to the proto-Engsvanyali Deities,
>could you say a little more on this topic?

Well... there's not a lot to say, but there will be some discussion in 
the book.  The Livyani and the Tsolyani each believe that they've "got 
it right" and the other is a little off.  There is a "gentleman's 
agreement" that these beliefs are not raised in polite company.  One 
doesn't swagger up to a priest of Quyo at a dinner party and say,
"Hoi, I used the Book of Ebon Bindings to summon up your so-called 
'god' the other day.  She wasn't too impressive!  Ate thirteen slaves 
and couldn't even turn Chlen-dung into gold!"  The Tsolyani respect 
Livyanu's history which extends all the way back to Llyan of Tsamra, 
and insofar as they view any other nation as being civilized, it's 
Livyanu.

On Earth, Christians and Protestants, Muslims, and Jews all hold different
beliefs about the "roots" of their religions, each of which partake of
common roots.  I daresay the Tsolyani and Livyani all handle interfaith
relationships better than we do -- but then again, they've had about
twenty times as long to learn to do so as we have.

<Communication cannot be "impossible" discussion edited>

It's all the same thing:  if a Ssu does not "want" to talk to you, 
then you are not "able" to talk with him.  

Do the Ssu and Humans share common points of reference?  Undoubtedly.  
They have swords, we have swords. They have heads, we have heads.  
There ought to be some way to say "head" for both species.  But I 
disagree that there MUST be some way, I only say there OUGHT to be 
some way.  The Ssu's way of saying "head" is to hand you yours.

The fact is, we cannot say "cannot".  We are unable to say "there 
exist two species such that they 'cannot' communicate".  We are 
equally unable to say "there 'cannot' exist two species such that they 
are unable to communicate".  Failing the ability to say "cannot", the 
issue becomes a matter of faith.  I, personally, can easily believe 
that there could be two mind-sets that are so different as to make 
communication impossible.  Here on Earth, persons born and raised in 
the same culture speaking the same languages are often unable to 
communicate.  That is to say, they speak the same words but cannot 
arrive at any mutual conclusions.  It all depends on how you define 
"communication".

>>[The Ssu] have better knowledge of the "old technologies of Humanspace"
>than the current human inhabitants!
  :   :
>If the Ssu had primitive spaceflight capabilities -- why aren't they using
>them now?

Well, first off I don't remember them HAVING that capability.  I could 
of course be forgetting.  However, assuming you're right, why don;t 
they have that ability now?  Well, ignoring all other reasons, 
infrastructure.  When 99% of your planet and its resources are in the 
hands of aliens, how the heck are you gonna build a spaceship?

I could be wrong, but I don't see them as any more technically capable 
than the Humans.  Like the Humans, they make use of remants of ancient 
technology, and like Humans they have rote-learned methods of creating 
and repairing some of it, but that's about it, methinks.

> It would seem unlikely that they would
>not have a concept/social idea of /celebration/

Why?  Again, we're talking TOTALLY ALIEN WORLDVIEWS here.  They don't 
have to embrace ANY ideas that we do, or value anything that we do.
There are points of coincidence, but they do not imply anything about 
what the Ssu see or how they feel.

Yes they dance, but do they enjoy it?

I just don't agree that this is a necessity. We're talking about an 
entirely alien species.  WE JUST DON'T KNOW.  Again, it's a matter of 
complete FAITH at this point.

It's important to understand that humans must label what they see in 
order to describe it, but that doesn't mean the labels are correct.
Just because we see a Ssu running fast doesn't mean he's "hurrying".
Just because our red blood cells move fast in our bloodstreams doesn't 
mean THEY are "hurrying".  The state of "hurrying" is a label we apply 
to a mental/emotional matrix placed in a situational context.  Just 
because we label a bee-dance a "dance" doesn't make it a "dance".

If something doesn't share the mental/emotional structures we employ, 
the label is an anthropomorphism and nothing more.  We can say, 
"Dislodged by the quake, the boulder hurried down the slope to reach
the cool embrace of the river" but that doesn't mean the boulder was 
agitated or experienced a state of anticipation for its bath.  
Likewise, the Ssu can engage in activities we call "war", "revenge", 
"territoriality", "construction" and even "writing", but that doesn't 
mean that they conceptualize these actions the same way we do.

How do we know?  Being unable to communicate with them, philophers 
and sophists could validly argue that the Ssu may not even be 
A) sentient, B) intelligent, or even C) alive.

Uh, are we talking about the hive-ships constructed by the Hluss?  I 
think those are made of bodily excretions and processed fibrous plant 
matter (in other words, great floating wasps-nests).  Ssu nautical 
craft I honestly know nothing about having (thank Hnalla) never met 
one.  They could be some food-of-the-Ssu variety of hardwood, or they 
could simply have long ago appropriated Humanspace woods for these 
uses, and the Ssu art of constructing Ssu-style ships could be a 
long-lost craft.

Well, again, you lose control of 99% of your territory and lose 90% of 
your population, you lose the infrastructural base to do these kinds 
of things.  For instance, the Space Shuttle flies, in part, because 
children in Third-world nations starve and die while working 
7-days-a-week 12-hours-a-day for $2/year.  When the plagues ravage the 
Third World, will the West endure?  Will the space shuttle fly when 
Africa, Southeast Asia, South and Central America, and parts of 
India and China lose half their populations to famine, pestilence, 
plague and war?  No.  The big companies that employ Third-World labor 
will find the labor costs have risen too far to make their profits, 
prices will be passed upwards, and exploding inflation will collapse 
the economy of the world.  Just about then the nukes will fly.  
According to the Professor, that's about, what, 16 years from now?

I am really intrigued by the veiled hints of the One Other's faith being a
cthonic substratum of orthodox Livyani theology -- maybe one of the reason's
why Dlash is really sealed? Does your temple book plan to touch on some of
these components? (i.e. Pariah Deities, syncretic deities such as Lady
Shirringayyi, etc.) 

I was particularily struck by the incorporation of Pariah thaumaturgical
devices/wards/magical diagrammes/terminology by the Engsvanyali/orthodox
sources (from The Book of Ebon Bindings) -- is this cross-fertilization, 
or did the worship of Pariah Deities result in the permeation of the 
orthodoxy (Livyani in this case) by "dark"/forbidden knowledge?  Is 
something "contained" their by Livyani demonology and sorcerous control? 
What do your informants in Tsamra have to say (or has the Vru'uneb muzzled

We have to be clear about our modalities here -- my /must/ is not a deontic

Oops, I think you lost me with this argument. Are you saying that use of
/cannot/ is syntactically precluded? (it is not.) Or epistemologically
precluded? Knowledge, on my reading, can be defined as /the result of a
reliable process/, which is an epistemically weaker notion than the one you
are using (I think). You seem to equate knowledge with something more
stringent. Therefore, everything which fails to pass your higher level
epistemic filter gets translated into /faith/ or /belief/. Am I wrong?

>Well, first off I don't remember them HAVING that capability.  I could

I believe the Gamescience sourcebook explicitly mentions this, defining it
as /primitive spaceflight/. The impression I got was that Humanspace
travellers found this fairly /puny/ technology compared to their super-duper
three-light drive. But then, the Ssu drives didn't weaken/collpase the
space-time fabric of the universe through repeated use, right?

That's right, good point. But what were those resources? I am still
wondering what they might have built the ships out of when they had access
to the /raw materials/. Iron poor Tekumel...

Are you forgetting the Ssu anti-personnel weapon from that solo adventure
book published by TOME? That struck me as mechanical technology pure and
simple. (i.e. rapid-firing optical laser with variable firing path
sequencing thrown in at no extra cost!) Pretty impressive stuff for "WEIRD,
TOTALLY ALIEN CREATURES". Maybe I am wrong, and the device was purely
"magical" - but it struck me that the Ssu had retained (and evolved) the
older pre-Time of Darkness technology much better that the Tsolyani.
Remember, the device was defined as a Ssu-produced artifact -- not as
something looted out of some "King of the Latter Time's" treasure horde.

But.....the fact that the humans of Humanspace (ugly turn of phrase) managed
to communicate with, what, fourteen other totally alien races, militates
against this sort of thing. Humans could negotiate, bargain, converse,
understand the Ahoggya and Pe Choi, but not the Ssu...this is really pushing
things a bit. I have to ask the question: how do you /know/ (my /know/) that
they possess a totally alien worldview? You're guessing, right, by your own
admission?!

Have you ever wondered about Ssu-Hokun and/or Ssu-Hluss communciation? I'll
bet the Hokun have been able to communicate with them -- perhaps with the
Black Ssu on the other side of Tekumel...now that might be an interesting
story to tell..

See my point above. Species difference does not imply anything, and the
empirical evidence of advanced inter-species communication in Humanspace
before the "Fall" inclines me to suggest that it is MUCH MORE LIKELY that
communication and understanding (but not necessarily agreement, mind you!)
between Ssu and human is likely. By my criteria (weaker epistemic filter) -
I /know/ this. :-)

You are quite a philosopher - excellent. However, you are conflating two
interrelated, but distinct epistemological topics. The first point, about
the arbitrary nature of any semiotic system, is a truism - I agree with you
completely. The conclusion you draw, sadly, is a non sequitor. We have to
introduce the notion of "fit" (i.e. how well do our arbitrary signs "fit"
with the world around us) before we draw any conclusions. We determine the
"fit" of our signs through various theoretical end empirical processes. One
of these is observation - looking at the world and trying to see how our
ideas "fit" with what is going on. On your theory, all /meaning/ is derived
from a mental state -- this is hardly an /indisputable/ position. Have you
read John Austin's essay "Other Minds" -- I think you would like it. Yes,
just because I call a set of Ssu kinaesthetic movements a "dance" does not
"make" it so in-and-of-itself -- the "fit" of that concept must be judged
through an epistemic process that transcends the individual instance.
Observation over a longer period of time will ultimately tell us if the Ssu
are dancing or merely trying to shed their skin (or both!). Don't be such a
skeptic!

<end>

But what would we, as rational agents, believe? All of this material is a
simulacrum (the Ssu, Tsolyanu, Tekumel, the Engsvanyali Deities, etc.) - we
can define it as much as we like - the /reality/ of Tekumel is much more
malleable than our own (unless you happen to be a paranoid schizophrenic or
psychopath - in which all reality is pretty much malleable :-)).

There's no such thing as a bad Ssu. ;-) They're just misunderstood! heh, heh.

>Uh, are we talking about the hive-ships constructed by the Hluss? 

No, I meant real /spaceships/ used for inner-system travel. Professor, would
you clarify this - I may have hallucinated the Ssu ships...

[Moderator's Note:  You didn't hallucinate.  They were there.

Ah, I'll buy that. But what if there are a few Ssu ships still left -- like
those never-rusting hulks in the Plain of Towers? Has anyone been out to
that place recently? Must be weirdly poetic to stare at those things,
cyclopean monoliths/totems to a long-forgotten ancestry.

Please consider publishing some of it as a work-in-progress. A page or two
would not be unreasonable, surely. Thanks for the intellectual workout. I
haven't gotten a chance to say /epistemic filter/ in ages. May the list

[Moderator's Note:  David Bailey adds to the Ssu topic.                     ]

There is only one way to solve the issue, gentlemen: we must travel the 
world of Tekumel together and try to communicate with the Ssu at every 
opportunity.

I, for one, will spend the next twenty years learning the most potent 
spells of defence and training an elite guard in anti-Ssu tactics.  Just in 
case.

There is, we have been told, an island where Ssu of red and blue are in a 
joint civilisation with mankind.  I have also had the pleasure of 
travelling with Dave Morris and Steve Foster to the far west, where a 
misguided king once employed black Ssu as guards (until we killed him for 
the most evil crime of race treason).  How would these fit with 'real 
Tekumel'?

I only wish that we could get together to find out.

Extended answer to the Vru'uneb question: Many Vru'uneb died in the Plague. 
Some "retired" and are now living as quietly as possible in rural areas 
beyond Mu'ugalavyani control. Others went underground and are now part 
of the Resistance, led by Lord Eyloa's daughter, Daileb (known as 
"Fire-face" because of skin reaction to the Plague).

One of the problems faced by Americans/Europeans in dealing with Tekumel (or 
with any non-Western -- and non-Western-influenced -- society is that our 
linguistic and epistemological constructs just may not apply. My players 
always imagine that it should be a straight line from discovering sulphur 
to making gunpowder and onwards to spaceflight! We know this was not so in 
human history here: science and "discovery" were quite slow all around the 
world until the communications explosion in the Renaissance and early modern 
period. My father saw the first petrol-powered automobiles in Washington 
State; my grandfather saw the first widespread use of electric lights; etc. 
Now we tend to forget all those previous centuries and imagine that a priest 
on Tekumel can singlehandedly develop gunpowder or some other tremendous 
technological advance. As I have said before, the Aztecs had wheeled toys 
but did not develop full-size wheeled carts or wheelbarrows; the Maya did 
not use the arch in their otherwise incredible architecture; we ourselves 
did not develop penicillin from moulds until the Second World War.

We tend to be far too "eurocentric" in our interpretations. There ARE 
linguistic mind-sets and perception differences that ae expressed in our 
languages. Benjamin Lee Whorf thought we could not think about concepts 
that we do not express in our languages. He probably overstated the case, 
but I myself have experienced languages and cultures so radically different 
from ours that it is hard to imagine their speakers coming up with 
identical linguistic/ epistemological categories close to ours. It is MUCH 
more difficult, thus, to imagine the Ssu or Hluss being able to perceive, 
classify, categorise, etc. in terms we humans understand. Sure, a Suu has 
a morpheme (or whatever) for "head," as well as for all other physical 
items, entities, and phenomena found in its environment; but how it puts 
these together in verbal constructs -- lacking human speech organs -- may 
be entirely unintelligible to us. I spent years teaching Americans to speak, 
read, and write various Middle Eastern languages, and I can tell you that 
differences in basic perception (of sounds, of grammar, of the world itself) 
make for unimagined difficulties. Sure, we can and do teach these languages, 
and those peoples can learn ours, but, then, we're all human, aren't we? 
Ssu and Hluss are not. Their language(s) are just too different -- ever 
tried chiming in modulated rises, falls, durations, sequences, and the like?
There is also the "hate factor," of course. There is, furthermore, a long-
held belief on both sides that communication with the other side is simply 
impossible. This last may be false, in reality, but it does make for no 
communication.

The Ssu did (do?) have some technology -- in human terms. They did not have 
the interstellar Three Light drive, but they were on the verge of inter-
stellar flight on very slow vessels powered by some other method. No one 
now knows exactly what was used and how far they got. The "Ssu mine" dates
from the last phase of their culture(s), just before humans invaded and 
smashed them flat. It probably was modelled after some device the Ssu had 
seen with the Pe Choi, the Shunned Ones, or some other interstellar race 
that happened to land on pre-human Tekumel. This is all conjecture -- it 
happened so long ago..!

Humans communicated with other races because the Pe Choi had already set up 
the linguistic matrix for them. Humanity did make valuable contributions 
to this interstellar Sprachfest, but they were basically late-comers.

We're belabouring this point a little heavily. Differences in human/Ssu 
speech organs, plus differnet categorisations of perception, plus completely 
different phonological/morphological/syntactic structures -- all make for 
a lack of communication par excellence! It may be POSSIBLE, but is it 
LIKELY to happen?

Hmm. Categorising perceptions is the name of the linguistic game. If your 
language does not express a difference between "singular" and "plural" (but 
rather, say, singularity versus distributive spread: one object/group of 
identical objects versus identical objects scattered around here and there), 
you cannot effectively express -- and think? -- in Aristotelian logical 
terms. If your language does not express "sex gender" (masculine, feminine, 
neuter), then you may have subtle perceptual reactions that make your 
perceptions of "reality" different from those of somebody using a strongly 
sex-based language. Other languages may not have "sex gender" at all but 
may have "shape gender": long objects, round objects, flat objects, liquid 
objects, etc. etc. that must be expressed in grammatical categories, 
resulting in quite different structurings of perceived "reality." ... Or 
maybe not. Whorf's hypothesis can never be proven because we ourselves are 
"limited" by our own linguistic categories and their structurings of our 
"reality." Boy, this gets tough!

Yes, but were they uilt by the Ssu or other indigenous Tekumelani, or are 
they from the time of human spaceflight?
 
You gentlepersons make some thought-provoking arguments. I'm grateful for

Yes, the temple book covers/will cover concepts germaine to modern-day 
players, i.e. "The city of Dlash is sealed, nobody knows quite why, 
however some rumors have it that..."  And deities such as Lady 
Shirringgayi are covered quite thoroughly so that players understand 
her relationship to Avanthe and Dlamelish (etcetera) and where they 
stand relative to Pavar's deities.

Certainly there are some interesting theological tangles in the 
Livyani pantheon.  Where germaine, and where this information can be 
pertinent to players it will appear.  What might NOT get into the 
Temple book is information judged "secret" even to players.  In other 
words, some of the underlying "truths" to Tekumel, which can be sensed 
in their thematic continuity from place to place and faith to faith 
will not be explicitly set forth.  Gotta have some element of mystery, 
after all...  These will be the Professor's call..

The professor can clarify, but Livyanu is under the military control

Uh...  of course.  Right.  (was that a jet?)

>>The fact is, we cannot say "cannot"...
>
>Oops, I think you lost me with this argument.

I'll try to be clearer:
  
     First off, one cannot prove a negative.  Therefore, one cannot 
claim "It is impossible for two sentient races to be incapable of 
communication".

     This is even more significant in light of how one defines 
sentient.  If the definition of sentient includes "capable of 
communication" then we have a logical loop:  if we ever encounter a 
species with which we cannot communicate, do we simply classify it as 
nonsentient despite other evidence to the contrary?

     Finally, how do we define "communication"?  Certainly when a Ssu 
runs towards you with a sword, he is communicating with you that he is 
trying to kill you.  If THAT is communication, it is indisputable.

>syntactically precluded?.. epistemologically precluded?..
>Therefore, everything which fails to pass your higher level
>epistemic filter gets translated into /faith/ or /belief/. Am I wrong?

This is the idea I was trying to convey:
     No beliefs about communications with alien species can be proved 
     since we have not met any.

     Therefore you and I can hold opposing beliefs about whether or
     not communication with such species is possible or even mandatory.

     The basis of our beliefs cannot be backed up with evidence.  
     Therefore they are matters of faith, backed up with logic.

>But then, the Ssu drives didn't weaken/collpase the
>space-time fabric of the universe through repeated use, right?

I honestly don't know.  The professor might know someone at the 
College who would know whether the Ssu had more than intra-system 
travel.  

>That's right, good point. But what were those resources? I am still
>wondering what they might have built the ships out of when they had access
>to the /raw materials/. Iron poor Tekumel...

Oh, I see.  Well, Tekumel was/is iron POOR, but it does not entirely lack 
iron or these other metals.  ADDITIONALLY, once you get one ship up, 
you could theoretically scamper out to the asteroids, moons and 
planets to get more metal...

Oh, Ssu mines?  Sure, they have those.  But I tell ya what, I haven't seen 
anything ELSE outta the Ssu in all my time on Tekumel.  Honestly, the 
Ssu have never done anything with a Ssu mine that couldn't have been 
accomplished by a trained monkey.  Humans at least can still use and 
repair things like air-cars, lightning-bringers, eyes and 
interfogulators.

Uh, no, because *I* am not trying to prove an assertion.  You are 
trying to prove that it MUST be possible to communicate with the Ssu.
I am pointing out theoretical reasons which undermine your assertion, 
e.g. that if the Ssu view things in an "alien" enough manner, they may 
be unable to communicate with us.

In attempting to DISprove a generalization such as yours, I need to 
come up with a single counterexample.  However, my counterargument is 
a negative (it is possible that we cannot communicate with the Ssu), 
therefore it cannot be proven.  So the best I can do is propose enough 
possible scenarios in which your generalization fails to provide some 
doubt.  Again, this is all faith.

The fact that we can and do communicate with some species does not 
mean we must be able to communicate with all species.  And our sample 
is not complete:  there may be many cases in its history where 
Humanspace was unable to communicate with an alien species.  We only 
know about those few who were involved in the fall of Tekumel.

>You are quite a philosopher - excellent. However, you are conflating two
>interrelated, but distinct epistemological topics. 

Damn, I wish I knew how I did that.  I could get a job as an 
epistemological conflationist.

>But what would we, as rational agents, believe? All of this material is a
>simulacrum 

Oh, nonono, you can't argue that the material is a simulacrum at this 
point, because then the entire argument collapses.  Hey, Professor 
Barker, can Humans communicate with Ssu under any circumstances?  No?  
Well that ends the discussion!

Besides, some of us are possessed of a certain sneaking suspicion that 
it's NOT a simulacrum... and others are certain!

I've never been to the Plain that I can recall.  They're Ssu ships?  I

[Moderator's Note:  Adam Levine adds to the Alien Races thread.              ]

While my approach to arguing for cultural and particularly language
isomorphisms between mankind and the Enemies of Man are different from Alex's,
I have to agree with most of his conclusions.  At the risk of also being
labeled a S'su Lover by Bob, I present the following additional thoughts ...

Every lifeform that has developed by natural selection, regardless of
sophistication or complexity, is attracted by stimuli that are pleasurable and
repulsed by stimuli that are displeasurable. If we define sophistication and
complexity to mean the ability to accurately describe one's environment, then
as the sophistication and complexity of a lifeform increases, so too does the
number of defined objects in that lifeform's vocabulary.  Further, every
object can be qualitatively categorized and described based on its pleasurable
and displeasurable effects on that lifeform.  These objects and their
descriptions form the basis of language.

To develop an effective means of communication requires common terms of
reference.  In order to effectively communicate, any two beings must have come
to consensus regarding the pattern of the language and the meanings of its
objects (e.g., nouns, verbs or their equivalents) including whether each
object is pleasurable or displeasurable and to what degree.  To arrive at this
consensus, object definitions must be derived from some combination of
instinctive or learned response.  

In general, the more instinctive a lifeform, the more predictable it is;
responses to stimuli are "hard-wired".  Given the inconsistent levels of
proficiency of the various Enemies of Man in such skills as combat and
sorcery, it is reasonable to conclude that a large part of each individual's
behavior is learned.  Therefore, it's also reasonable to conclude that each of
their respective languages is also learned.

Given the physical and language isomorphisms between Man and the Enemies of
Man - i.e., the Enemies of Man have roughly similar anatomy used for most of
the same purposes - and given the observation that they respond to stimuli in
many of the same ways including curiosity, fear and anger, it seems reasonable 
that our world-views and languages have reasonably congruent bases.  In other
words, it should be possible to communicate with most of the Enemies of Man.

The argument that they do not want to communicate and therefore, communication
is effectively impossible is clearly valid.  I submit that hatred for Man and
his allies is so ingrained into the cultures of the Enemies of Man, that our
eventual destruction is probably part of their religion ... NEXT YEAR IN THE
PROMISED LAND!

By virtue of the conclusion that most of their responses are learned, it also
seems reasonable to conclude that the Enemies of Man gather in groups to share
common pleasurable experiences.  However, it cannot be necessarily inferred
that what Man finds pleasurable and what their Enemies find pleasurable are
even remotely the same; clearly there are too many cultural differences.

Ah, the Plain of Towers, I remember it as a place of shifting sands and 
howling winds.  'Look on my works ye mighty and dispair', and all is 
shadows and sudden, looming shapes.

There are strange shaman wandering in the rocky hollows and the call of sad 
beasts chills the night.  many of our party simply ran in fear, and a few 
were spirited away in the darkness.

My warrior companion was killed when he tried to prize open the metal door 
at the foot of a baked clay tower.  Alas for him the baked clay was the 
dust of millennia dried onto the skin of a metal spire, and the rock of 
many ages fell on him.

Inside the towers there were whispering ghosts and strange visions of no 
substance.  In two places we found the remains of strange inhumans, one a 
desiccated hokun.  In other places we found a gateway to the red moon, and 
in yet another we found a strange rod that devoured the souls and minds of 
sorcerers.

We left, having failed to find what we sought, and in fear of our lives, 
for, on the last night we heard a rushing of air from a pit in the ground, 
and a party of black ssu had come out on us by surprise.

Go not to the plain of towers my noble friends, for all is decay and 
despair.

[Moderator's Note:  Sandy Petersen adds to the Alien Races discussion.  ]

Some time ago I posted some messages on keen techniques to try to  
communicate with the inimicals. Since then there have been some  
comments that the inimicals _could_ theoretically be communicated  
with. I, in fact, do not think this is necessarily the case.

>Not /wanting/ to talk to someone is not synonymous with not being  
>/able/ to speak with them.

	It is if you are _genetically_ incapable of wanting to talk  
to someone. Think about it.

>I just don't buy linguistic relativism at all -- all concepts can be
>"communicated" ... we are much closer in our customs and ideas than 
>we are apart.

	Bunk. There's plenty of linguistic things that we can't  
communicate even with our genetically-similar languages here on  
earth. Humans are relatively similar, yet can't communicate certain  
things effectively. The thought of communicating with a creature  
that evolved on a different planet is almost inconceivable. It would  
not have DNA. It would not have a brain. It might have an organ  
that acts the same way as our brain, in the same way that an  
insect's wings are analogous to a bird's wings, but the two types of  
wings operate in _utterly_ different fashions.

>The Ssu-Human interaction is a case in point I am willing to bet  
>that we and they share much more of our conceptual frameworks then  
>we do not.

	I hereby bet against you.

>All those Ssu exploratory parties exploring the Tsuru'um beneath the 
>Tekumelani cities, looking for ancient technology...they certainly 
>do seem to share many of our interests.

	If you watch a hive of bees tending the queen, you might  
conclude that "she is their king, just as we humans have a king",  
but you would be wrong. She is a slave, and at appropriate times the  
workers thwart and even kill her. Do not be fooled that similar  
actions mean similar motivations.

>It would seem unlikely that they would not have a concept/social  
>idea of /celebration/ - even bees have their little "dances" in the  
>hive

	I think if there is _anything_ peculiarly human it is the  
celebrations. Bee dancing is a fine case in point. The bees dance,  
not to show happiness, but to communicate the direction and distance  
and amount of a particular honey supply. It is their main method of  
"speech". I wonder how much the Ahoggya dancing resembles this.

>Remember, Ssu society has continued to evolve and change just like  
>the Humanspace-descended societies -- they haven't just been "biding 
>their time" -- they are an evolving species on Tekumel.

	Very few animals in the world have a non-genetically  
determined society. Humans happen to, so we assume intelligent  
aliens would, too, but I see no reason this must be so. A learned  
society is not necessarily advantageous, nor is a genetic society  
necessarily too rigid and fixed. If Ssu society is genetic, it would  
not change over the course of just a few thousand years -- unless  
of course the Ssu mutation rate was MUCH greater than ours. Which it  
could be, of course, there's no need to assume that they use  
nucleic acids in a DNA-like structure to code their genes.

>Being unable to communicate with them, philophers and sophists  
could >validly argue that the Ssu may not even be A) sentient, B)  
>intelligent, or even C) alive.

	Well, I would say they were alive, but since their brains  
evolved out of some proto-organ having _nothing_ to do with what our  
brains came from, there's no reason to suppose they are A or B.

The Ssu make sounds that appear to communicate with other ssu, but  
not necessarily as we understand it. Here are three possible  
theories as to what the Ssu "chiming" actually does:
	1) For humans, communication is an attempt to let another  
person know what I feel. For a blackbird, communication is an  
ejaculation -- the equivalent of a laugh, a cry of pain, or an "oh  
shit" type of noise. A blackbird that sees a cat can no more  
suppress his alarm call than a human hearing something funny can  
easily suppress a smile, or a human watching a loved one die can  
suppress his or her tears. The Ssu "communications" might not be  
attempts to let other ssu know what they are "thinking", but merely  
a highly complex version of the alarm call. No wonder humans can't  
learn their tongue -- there is no tongue to learn. You can't speak  
like the ssu unless you _feel_ like the ssu. Of course, other ssu  
hearing the alarm call react appropriately.
	2) Perhaps, like social insects, all Ssu are mentally  
identical (I mean this quite literally), and they have no need for  
true communication, because given a situation, all Ssu would react  
exactly the same (well, not really, because different Ssu have  
different abilities, and so would adjust reactions based on their  
own powers, but you get my point). Hence the chimes are not true  
communication, but simple updates as to the user's position and what  
he sees, so that other Ssu can know what he is clearly about to do.  

	3) Perhaps the Ssu chimes are echolocation, or the "ticks"  
of their biological clock, or necessary "prayers" to keep their  
magic going, or something that has nothing whatsoever to do with  
communication.
	I'm not saying that one of these explanations is correct.  
I'm trying to show just _how_ alien an alien species can be.

>Finally, how do we define "communication"?  Certainly when a Ssu
>runs towards you with a sword, he is communicating with you that he
>is trying to kill you.

	Not so. If he waved the sword around to intimidate you  
first, _that_ would be communication, but simple attempt to attack  
is not communication. You, of course, might infer that he is trying  
to kill you from his action, but that's not the same as  
communication, any more than watching bacteria multiply under the  
microscope means they're trying to "communicate" that they want to  
infect you.

>Humans could negotiate, bargain, converse,understand the Ahoggya  and
>Pe Choi, but not the Ssu

	Okay. Now Uncle Sandy (attempts to) Explains All.

A THEORY AS TO THE NON-COMMUNICATION WITH THE INIMICAL RACES
	Non-understanding is not limited to native Tekumel races,  
clearly. The Shunned Ones and Hlutrgu are not native species, yet we  
cannot speak with them either. No doubt there were dozens of  
"inimical" races before Tekumel vanished from space but only two  
(keep your fingers crossed -- might be another one somewhere) set up  
bases on Tekumel. For all we know, non-communication might be the  
NORM out there. Especially given such weirdos as the Mihalli and  
barely-understandable Ahoggya.
	Now, alien races no doubt fall into certain identifiable  
categories, just as on earth. A pack predator, for instance, is  
likely to have a society rather similar to that other pack predator  
-- Homo sapiens, and may well be able to communicate with us. Note:  
by "social predator" I mean predators that hunt in groups and have a  
fairly egalitarian society based partially on cooperation and  
partially on dominance. Examples: Baboons, Wolves, Killer Whales.  
These species are quite easy for us to comprehend. Wolves,  
especially as modified into dogs, seem quite similar to our own  
race, much more so than the genetically similar gorilla, which  
appears filthy (they sleep in their own feces), unfamilial (they  
have sex with their own daughters), etc. Though we can learn to  
appreciate and love gorillas, it is not as simple as loving a dog.
	Let's test this theory.
	Of the 12 most common species, which are also pack  
predators? I submit that the Shen and Pygmy Folk are clearly such  
(the Pygmy Folk still love to fight en masse). Ditto for the Pe Choi  
and Pachi Lei. These are also (no coincidence) the species that are  
most understandable to humans.
	I dunno _what_ the Tinaliya and Swamp Folk evolved from,  
but I suggest that at least the Swamp Folk may have had similiar  
ancestry.
	But look at the Hlaka. I don't think they cooperate much to  
hunt (though of course they can), though they do flock together for  
their nesting areas. Sounds more like seabirds or bats than wolves  
and killer whales. Sure enough, they're rather hard for us to deal  
with and understand.
	The Ahoggya seem to live mainly by fishing and solitary  
activities. I dunno what terrestrial creature to compare them to,  
but it sure as hell ain't a wolf or killer whale. Or human.
	Now, for the inimical races. I submit that all these races  
have certain very interesting features in common. Check this out.
	1) All have a caste structure. The Hlutrgu have their  
"officers", the Hluss their hive mothers, etc.
	2) All are exceedingly hostile. Not just to humanity, but  
to just about _all_ other races (except that the Hluss and Ssu are  
able to get along). While the Ahoggya and Shen dislike one another,  
it's nothing like the racial hate held by the inimicals. I suggest  
that this hatred is not a learned thing. The Perfessor's comparison  
of a young Hlutrgu with a young cobra or piranha brings a vivid  
image to one's mind at this point.
	3) They seem to live in huge groups. You just don't find a  
small band of Hluss or Ssu eking out a quiet existence in the  
wilderness, which you often see among Hlaka, humans, Mihalli,  
Ahoggya, Shen, etc. They seem to need large numbers of their  
fellow-beings to survive. Though the Hlutrgu live in somewhat  
smaller groups than the other three, the basic principle remains  
true.
	4) They seem to be insanely brave in combat. Morale is  
quite high. I do not think this is because they are angry at us, but  
because they have only a rudimentary sense of self-preservation.
	5) They seem to cooperate a hell of a lot better than most  
other races. Shen kill each other all the time. So do humans. There  
are bandits among the Pygmy Folk, the Ahoggya, etc. But how often do  
we see a pair of Shunned Ones in an argument? Has _anyone_ ever  
seen a pair of Hluss in a duel?

	Okay. Put together these five features, and what do they  
remind you of? Does "social insects" spring to mind for anyone  
besides me?
	Here is a quote from a pulitzer-prize winning book on Ants  
(remember, this is written by two PhDs who have spent their life  
studying ants in the most scientific manner possible):

"Ants are arguably the most aggressive and warlike of all animals.  
They far exceed human beings in organized nastiness; our species is  
by comparison gentle and sweet-tempered. The foreign policy aim of  
ants can be summed up as follows: restless aggression, territorial  
conquest, and genocidal annihilation of neighboring colonies  
whenever possible. If ants had nuclear weapons, they would probably  
end the world in a week."

	Sure as hell sounds like the Hluss, Ssu, Shunned Ones, and  
Hlutrgu to me. I submit that humans had experience with such beings  
in outer space, and when they came to Tekumel and discovered (to  
their horror) that the place was overrun with such nasties, they put  
them in their place. Humans, of course, are far too nice to simply  
exterminate the Ssu or Hluss, and stuck them in reservations.
	But the reason the Ssu or Hluss hate us today is NOT  
because we took their planet away from them. If the Ssu owned 95% of  
the planet, and humans were all crammed into one tiny country, the  
Ssu would wipe us out just to finish the job (right, Professor?)

So in summary. We cannot communicate with the inimicals because (I  
surmise) they are social animals, of a higher degree of society than  
we can comprehend. Our own species has a sense of self. We are not  
superorganisms, hive creatures, gestalts. But they are. Their  
worldview is utterly incompatible with our own, but it is neither  
inferior nor crude.
	Of course, it's easy to imagine a species relentlessly  
hostile to humanity that was _not_ a hive creature. All kinds of  
things can exist. There may even be hive creatures somewhere that  
would be neutral or friendly to mankind, though I still suspect we  
couldn't communicate. Note: do not confuse the Pe Choi with social  
insects just because they are vaguely insectoid and share telepathy  
with one another. We're not talking biology here, but ecology, if  
you see what I mean.

Okay. Let the flames begin.

	1) You are looking at the effect backwards. For many  
organisms, the stimulus _is_ the response. A freshwater hydra cannot  
"choose" whether or not it is going to contract when poked by a  
pin. Its nerve net simply bunches up. It is not a question of  
"attraction" or "repulse". A moth flying into a flame doesn't "like"  
the flame -- the parallax of the moving light screws up its  
navigational system.
	2) Even on a more sophisticated level, this statement is  
simply false. Termite warriors are attracted to pain and death. Do  
they _like_ pain and death? Hard to say, but there are other cases  
in which unpleasant stimuli are reacted to in ways humans would not.

	This is so patently wrong as not to need falsification. In  
the first place, "learning" behavior for a Hluss or Ssu might be as  
simple as turning on or off parts of the brain. I see no reason to  
imagine that just because there is variability in certain skills,  
they must have the same type of crudely learned language as humans.

>By virtue of the conclusion that most of their responses are

	I repeat, just because combat and sorcery _might_ be  
learned (maybe it's just a matter of breeding, or age -- the older a  
Ssu gets, the more sorcery it might get) does not mean _any_ other  
response needs to be learned.
	Very few creatures outside humanity and its closest  
relatives group together to share pleasurable experiences. The  
thought of a Ssu
birthday party sends me into such paroxysms of laughter that I  
almost altered my position, and decided that they _must_ have such  
celebrations. But sanity prevailed at the end. A Ssu doesn't need  
group pleasure any more than does a rattlesnake, a sea elephant, or  
a spider wasp. And all those species get together in bands at times  
for quite different reasons.

More on this /communication/ thread. Egad, this is really starting to spiral
out of control.

Several interesting points and counterarguments have been made in response
to my initial observations about Ssu communication. Observations range from
linguistic observations about classifiers and preconditions for /logical/
thought to formal arguments based on counterfactual conditionals and, most
recently, egentic and evolutionary observations. The input of all parties
concerned has been appreciated.

Now...

Before we go off on a tangent again, allow to clarify something: I do not
care to discuss the /modality/ of this topic. Necessarily, not necessarily
not, possibly, possibly not necessary. My points do not relate to modal
logic or its application to linguistic theory as relates to fantasy
roleplaying game environments.

My observations and comments are inductive generalizations based on the
empirical evidence provided by Prof. Barker. By empirical evidence, I mean
explicit langauge of the sourcebook and other "official" materials. As such,
formalistic arguments based on counter factual constructions mean absolutely
nothing. Logically equivalent constructions NOT based on counterfactual
entailment paradoxes can be provided for all points raised. So there.

There has never been an argument advanced that anything conjectured about
the Ssu /has to be the case/ - such legitimation claims have not been
advanced. The points made were based on an empirical survey of extant source
material and reasonable inferences drawn from them. 

Parenthetically, it is interesting to note that neither Mr. Alberti nor
Mr. Petersen base any of their arguments/comments/counter-examples on any
specific exegesis or hermeneutic of the texts (sourcebook, EPT ruleset,
Journal articles).

You are using /genetically/ in a parasitic sense. Not holding a degree in
genetics and neuro-linguistics, as you surely must, I do not even clearly
understand what you mean. I must note that an evolutionary mutation
suppressing the formation of intentional states of consciousness does not
seem /evident/ from any biological research done to date. You must have
access to vast sums of knowledge unavailable to the non-specialist. Please
provide an example. /Bees/ are not genetically "suppressed" from wanting to
communicate, their evolution has never been based
communication-with-another-species. Doesn't your point really just collapse
into the "they are just unable to speak"? I think so. Evolutionary
mechanisms might preclude the formation of communicative organs, but
suppression of intential states? What reputable scientist advances this notion?

>There's plenty of linguistic things that we can't

Genetically similar? Cannot communicate? See Mr. Alberti's precis on
counterfactuals.

Linguistic things? Now there's a precise concept if I ever heard one. Such
as? Are you discussing semantic, speech pragmatic, or syntactic /linguistic
things/? Clarify. Provide us with at least three clear examples supporting
your hypothesis. I WILL wager you cannot, in part because NO ONE has ever
been able to do this. More inductive generalization....

Are you suggesting, like Prof. Barker, that syntactic entities such as
classifiers and particles preclude logical entailment, because those
languages do not map isomorphically into standard English? Japanese, Quiche,
and Mandarin all make extensive use of syntactic constructions involving
classifiers and particles, yet have very well developed systems of thought,
entailment, and reasoning that can be EASILY translated into Aristotelian or
(hell, why not, you guys brought it into the discussion) Fregean formal
logic systems. So much for semantic incomensurability! If you don't believe,
I'll send you some material privately. Language for human beings is part of
the wetware, probably an emergent property of our neurology. As such, we all
share the same /universal grammar/ for language production -- although the
surface structure of our languages can be, on superficial examination, miles
apart.

These /arguments for incommensurability of langauges/ seem to often be made
by people who are monolingual. The typical(50% pop+) American is a prime
example of this; not knowing how to speak another language, they imagine all
sorts of fantastical "gulfs" existing between peoples, language systems,
etc. When you speak, read, and write multiple languages you find that not
only are most people able to communicate with eachother (given patience and
a modicum of sympathy), but that their viewpoints, beliefs, and aspirations
are remarkable similar. Take Europe or the indian subcontinent as your
"sample": you will find dozens of languages spoken, with multi-lingualism
the norm rather than the exception.

You seem to be unaware of one aspect of /Ssu/ culture that is clear and
explicitly defined by Prof. Barker: the Ssu have a well developed writing
system. Analysis of this /semiotic system/ could prove enlightening, much as
Linda Schele's work on decypherment of Mayan heiroglyphics has provided
fascinating information on the thought processes, ideas, and social
structure of the Maya. In this instance, scholars could analyze the writing
system without having to "talk to the Ssu" directly. We know this has
happened before with the Mihalli -- and these pan-dimensional beings are
probably even "MORE ALIEN" than the Ssu! The savants of the Latter Times
made transcriptions, grammars, and study aids in the writing system of the
Mihalli -- and were able to successfully "harness" some of the meaning.
Scholars recently conevend in Paya Gupa to discuss this very topic. 

The point is: the existence of a writing system CAN form a legitimate basis
for the emploration of Ssu communication systems (maybe not just their
"spoken language(s)" - but other semiotic systems as well - music,
mathematics, architecture, etc. Are you starting to get the point? I do not
CARE about the /possibility/ of non-communication, I am much more interested
in the narrative and culture "fun" one could have with study of /Ssu/
semiotic systems. I think one's Tekumel could be much more interesting if
the Ssu, Hluss, and other "Enemies of Man" were no longer relegated to being
one-dimensional bad guys (social insects). This is a personal preference.

You and Mr. Alberti are both making assumptions about Ssu society, genetics, 
and linguistics. That's fine, I genuinely don't mind. Both of you, however, 
have failed to take into account, and explain, the empirical evidence 
adumbrated by Prof. Barker in the source material. Shamoo the Killer whale 
does not write books or build complex cities. Bees do not manufacture energy 
weapons and have spaceflight capability. As Mr. Levine has pointed out, the 
dissimilarity between various members of the Ssu race intimates that they 
are not the "cookie-cutter" creatures that ants and bees are. The fact that 
the Ssu have a demonstrable interst in pre-Fall Humanspace technology would 
indicate to me that their cognitive sophistication is at least analogous 
enough to bear further study -- both direct "field linguistics" and secondary 
exegesis and analysis of Ssu semiotic remnants (wall carvings, architecture, 
"writing", etc.)

If you shared a planet with an inimical race that had a demonstrable and
keen interest in using an adapting your technology (futher its own culture
as well as combat yours) you might be a little more inclined to viewing them
as /sentient/ and /intelligent/. Sophists and philosophers notwithstanding.

Oh, thank you (profusely). No, assume that all of your assumptions and
theories are wrong? Where would you go from there? The point of the thread
was to "what if"-type theorizing, not come to a dispositive conclusion about
this topic.

This assumption is not supported by any empirical evidence. The thought
occurs that a major stumbling block for communication with the Shunned Ones
is a lack of a compatible atmosphere for both sides to operate in. It makes
diplomatic missions sort-a difficult...

It's a mystery shrouded in an enigma expressed as a riddle! :-) 

As per the Mihalli, you are completely wrong, of course. Please refer to
your EPT rulebook, you will find at least one book written in Mihalli (Liob
or Hlorush...) that is indeed /intelligable/ to a degree to humans. Again,
just because I cannot hold a /conversation/ with a species does not entail a
lack of all communication (semantic interrepresentation) with that species
and its /conceptual framework/. Speech is not the only, or perhaps even
best, way to /communicate/ when analyzing new species/cultures/societies.
Think about it. The Mihalli are a great example for MY hypothesis -- that
you can /inter-represent/ semantic categories and concepts even between
radically distinct species. Oops, I guess that's a point for the our side.

Strike one.

"Bird"-like creatures that human beings can easily communicate with. They
are often used as aerial scouts in Qadaryal (sp?). This makes them a better
argument for my type of hypothesis than yours. Ask General Kettukal, the
Hlaka seem to like him especially. (From Deeds of thr Ever-Glorious) Hard to

The clan system of Tsolyanu and the other empires is a prima facia /caste
system/. This is not evidence of anything. Duh. That's why there are "ranks"
of clans.

The Shen-Ahoggya dislike IS racial/species-based, if the sourcebook is any
kind of "accurate" account! What do you mean its "nothing like" the Ssu
hatred of humanity? Put a Shen and an Ahoggya in a room, and one will be
another's lunch (more often than not). Put a Ssu and a human in an adjoining
room -- same result.

>	3) They seem to live in huge groups. You just don't find a

But people have OFTEN encountered Ssu raiding parties and expeditions in the
Tsuru'um. On the basis of that, one could reasonably infer that they can
exist in small groups for extended periods of time. Just like humans. It's a
/point of similarity/.

>	4) They seem to be insanely brave in combat. Morale is  
>quite high. I do not think this is because they are angry at us, but

Insanely brave? Since when? The Ssu expeditionary parties seem to bear a
much closer resemblance to human "dungeon-crawlers" that your comment would
indicate. Cautiously moving through the Tsuru'um in small bands....looking
for technological goodies. Rudimentary sense of self-preservation huh? What
would you call the fanatical charges of members of the Legion of Searing
Flame into a battle "evidence of a lack of self-preservation"? No, you would
call it /elan/, /esprit de corps/, /discipline/...etc. The same group
dynamic could be evidenced in the Ssu.

Strike two.

Cooperate? Really? Professor?

The issue of the Shunned Ones (and the other Humanspace imported species) is
totally off point here. The discussion was Ssu.

Oh, that ant analogy is weak. How many ant species leave writings, repair
other species's technology? As if!

Ahhhhhh......No. The explicit language from the source material was that it
was "impracticable" to eradicate the last few stragglers. Just like the
gradual resistence of bacteria to antibiotcs (the stronger "strains"
survive), the terraformers may well have produced a "strain" of Ssu that
could tenaciously cling to life on Tekumel, moving underground, etc. Human
"generosity" does not appear to have come into the picture at all. Just as
human science can let a few "super-strong strains" of bacteria float around
without obssessing about it, ther Humanspace terraformers could probably
stomach the remnants of the Ssu. As for the /camps/ -- do the names
Jasenovac, Bergen Belsen, or Dachau ring a bell?

Strike three.

Ahhhh.....No. Were they that "hardwired" they probably would have just
attacked humanity enmass and perished sometime in the Latter Times. They are
far too intelligent to just "hurl themselves" at us in a
biologically-programmed destruction program.

The only thing this theory is missing is evidence, otherwise it is a
wonderful theory.
All things being equal, your theory is not all that persuasive. However, it
is your theory. good luck with it.

[Moderator's Note:  Bob Dushay adds his slant to the Alien Races thread.   ]

I just read the whole pile of inimical race communication comments.  I 
just want to add some more background to the argument:

1. It is pretty well accepted that humans are "hard-wired" for language.
All human languages, including sign language, share certain features.
There is no reason to assume that even if Ssu chiming is language, as we
understand the term (see Sandy Peterson's excellent post for other
possibilities), that it follows rules that can be grasped by humans.
Even if you assume that all human languages can be translated to all other
human languages without loss of meaning (I am not entirely convinced of
this), this is no reason to assume that alien languages must share this
property.

2. There are other races besides the Inimicals on Tekumel that humans 
found difficult/impossible to communicate with.  I cannot remember the
reference exactly, but prior to the disaster, the rulers of humanspace
outlawed attempts to contact the Mihalli because they were too alien.
In "Flamesong" we saw humans communicating easily with the Mihalli, but
this doesn't match the picture we get of them in the game, where their
behavior is essentially entirely random so far as humans are concerned.

3. Needless to say, the Professor's comment that the Inimicals aren't WILLING
to communicate makes this a philosophical question as to whether 
communication is POSSIBLE in any logical sense.  In the practical sense,
it has been entirely ruled out.  The Professor and Sandy draw the Ssu and
Hluss as similar to social insects, and I follow this idea--they aren't
sentient in the same way that humans are, and their worldview is going to
be totally alien to ours.

4. Just to trip myself (and all the others up), in the Orange solo
adventures book, the Hluss mother does communicate with humans.  Perhaps
the professor could explain why this is shown in an official Tekumel
product when it contradicts all he has been telling us?

[Moderator's Note:  Darryl Adams comments on Space exploration.            ]

This is in reguard of the idea that the Ssu and Human Space exploration 
in Tekumel.

First of all, Humanity has the technology now on Tekumel to launch a 
space mission. Given the ease of tapping into interdimensional power, 
some clever mage could conceivably construct a spell that either negates 
gravity or produces enough thrust to reach escape velocity. And the 
materials available to the Empire would be better suited launch a mission 
than current technology here on Earth.

What is to stop a wooden ship? Or a hide ship? Maybe some clever 
[Tekumelani] has found a laquer that would turn these vessels into a 
airtype container? The mass of these ships would require less energy to 
launch than metal ships (thou re-entry might be a problem).

And of course the Ssu could conceivably construct the same ships, or use 
what remnants of their own technology (Though its survival after the 
conquest and 10,000 years might be a problem).

The problem is that the Average [Tekumelani] would have no desire to 
explore outside space, due to the fact there is no stars to get romantic 
over , and the culture of the planet is not adventurous.

For inspiration, look at Ironwolf (by Howard Chaykin). If the Impirium 
could build wooden ships, surely Tekumel could.

I don't think Adam is too far off here.  I think you can't say that it
is "so patently wrong as not to need falsification."  In the first case,
it is very difficult to know what Ssu or Hluss can do or not do, since 
they are imaginary creatures.  In the end, the Professor will report what
they are and are not capable of doing/learning.  None of us can really
say how wrong something like this is, because we don't have enough solid
information on the inner workings of the Ssu and Hluss and the way their
societies have evolved.  In all likelihood the Professor may not even know.

It doesn't preclude that, either.  We just don't know.

Well, I haven't read the Orange adventure book in a long time.  But in 
message 118 from Bob Dushay, he refers to a part of an adventure where
the Hluss mother speaks to the adventurer.  I believe it was voicing 
anger at the killing of its brood.  I don't remember if she referred
to them as her children or not... in any case, it does sound like there
is some grouping/attachment that appears on an evolutionary level above
creatures like bees and ants.  In the end, I don't know.  Only one
among us may possibly know.  I'll continue to keep an open mind on whether
Ssu have family units, and whether or not they learn the same way we do
until there is absolute proof one way or the other.

Don't throw out a hypothesis until there is firm data to warrant it.

In any case, there just isn't enough of said data, so the answer has to
remain as the Professor has noted in numerous places, that it is impossble
to communicate meaningfully with the Races in question.
