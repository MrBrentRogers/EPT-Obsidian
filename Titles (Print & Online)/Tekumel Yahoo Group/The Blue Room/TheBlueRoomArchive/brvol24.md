[Moderator's Note:  George Hammond asks about being at ease on Tekumel.    ]

Hello all!

In the midst of a conversation with the inimitable Messrs. Saul and
Schwartz, an interesting question came up regarding Tsolyani society.  We
were wondering what, if any, mechanisms there are in the society for
releasing social tension.  The intense regard for status and position, and
the constant concern with reputation and noble action, would seem to make
nearly all social interaction pretty stressful for the middle and upper
strata, and the constant squeeze of tax collection, rents, inducements to
magistrates, etc. on the rural classes would seem to press hard as well. 
When do Tsolyani relax?  Are there social events that release this
pressure? 

On the individual level, it appears that adults can only "let their hair
down" in the company of a few explicitely acknowledged friends, nearly
always of the same sex and clan.  True?  or have I overlooked something?

On a larger group level, the Sourcebook suggests that there is some
relaxation of the social boundaries in the Hirilakte arenas, and I imagine
that some of the more ecstatic temple rites might have this effect.  Are
there other large social events that might serve this purpose?  My
impression is that the 5 Empires at least have nothing like Euro cultures'
carnivals or feasts of misrule.

thanks,

George

Practical example: in, I believe, the Le'Morte de Arthur:  Guinevere and 
Launcelot are having one of their highly "scandalous" dialogues when 
suddenly, out of the blue for a modern audience, mention is made of 
Guinevere's maids doing this that or the other thing. Your immediate 
reaction is, "But-- but-- but-- they would never have that conversation 
in front of others!"  The medieval reaction is merely, "What do you mean? 
They're just servants. They're always about."

[Moderator's Note:  The Professor answers Tom's question about Ru.          ]

The little city of Ru is an anomaly: a Tsolyani town right on the border of
Salarvya, with which it trades constantly. It has come under considerable
Salarvyani influence but still retains its essential Tsolyani character.
There was an article in the old Wargamer's Digest about the Battle of Ru --
I imagine one of our bibliographers can find you the reference to the
issue.

I don't have a map of the place, as nearly as I can recall, but I do recall
that the town was founded during the Tsolyani wars in Salarvya fought by
Emperor Kanmi'yel Nikuma I (1,031-1,067 A.S.). Later, at the time of the
Siege of Mmillaka, Emperor Hejjeka II "the Heretic" (1,325-1,340).populated 
it with colonists from the east-central provinces of the Empire. He expected 
the settlement to be the first to carry the banners of Tsolyanu into the 
Salarvyani homeland. This did not work: the "invasion" ended in a stand-off, 
with the Tsolyani facing a sea of hostile Salarvyani around them. The 
Salarvyani tolerated Ru because it was a useful trading depot, but they 
allowed few Tsolyani into their own areas, and the teaching of the Tsolyani 
temples was forbidden (in particular the Engsvanyali doctrine that the two 
goddesses, Avanthe and Dlamelish, are separate beings; the Salarvyani 
consider them both Aspects of one Goddess: Shiringgayi).

Emperor Gyesmu, the Iron Fist (2,015-2,065 A.S.), restored Ru and started
to construct fortifications and public buildings, but these were left
unfinished when he died. Up until the short reign of Emperor Dhich'une, Ru
was a quiet backwater town, with both Tsolyani and Salarvyani merchants and
culture. With Emperor Hirkane gone, the Salarvyani struck out from Koyluga
and Khum to take it back. They managed to capture Ru but could not hold it
against Tsolyani counterattacks. They were persuaded not to burn the town
to the ground by the Governor of Ru, who pointed out that scorched earth
tends to spread back toward those who begin it. (The merchant clans of Ru
are also allied to mercantile clans in Salarvya; this was another reason
the town still stands.)

The city is roughly an oval, with various small lakes and ponds on the
south, in the midst of lush fields and groves of trees. The Gilraya Forest
begins to the west, and parties of noble hunters often come to try their
luck with Serudla and other beasts there. About 80-90 Tsan to the south
lies the ancient city of Mmilaka, besieged by Emperor Hejjeka II during the
1300. It is much more a typical Salarvyani town, with bulbous domes, thick
pillars, ornate decoration, and colourful and opulent palaces.

Phil

There are lots of localised parties and ceremonies within the clanhouses.
There are games and pastimes, too. These do not tend to be more
universalised: e.g. there is no Jakalla Serudlas baseball team. The
gladiatorial fights in the Hirilakte Arenas are about the equivalent of
TV-violence-watching. Many people gamble, both with friends and also at
parties. Drinking and getting slightly snookered please some folk, while
others prefer listening to music, watching slave dancers swing and sway,
etc. In the villages there are real folkdances with a lot of jokes and
raillery, One must watch one's tongue, of course, and make no jokes or
comments that touch upon someone's honour and nobility; that way lies
Shamtla and conflict.

The stresses and conflicts you mention in your first paragraph are quite
accurate and real, but people tend to adjust and survive them, just as New
Yorkers here seem to survive the myriad pressures of their complex city.

What you are asking, I think, is whether there are times, environments,
etc. in which the Tsolyani "let down their hair" and relax with each other
in looser, "democratic" style: make insulting jokes, laugh and enjoy each
other's company as American youths seem to do. Sorry to say that this is
rather rare on Tekumel.

>On the individual level, it appears that adults can only "let their hair
>down" in the company of a few explicitely acknowledged friends, nearly
>always of the same sex and clan.  True?  or have I overlooked something?

True. Within the clanhouses one can relax somewhat with one's relatives,
chosen friends, and clansmen. Once in awhile old friends can relax and do
this across clan boundaries and even religious boundaries. Crossing the
lines between high and low clans, diamterically opposed religions, or
national/cultural lines is still more rare, although instances can be cited.

>On a larger group level, the Sourcebook suggests that there is some
>relaxation of the social boundaries in the Hirilakte arenas, and I imagine
>that some of the more ecstatic temple rites might have this effect.

Coupling a high noble with a lower class washerwoman might be briefly
possible but can lead to nothing lasting. The temples of Dlamelish and
Avanthe try to provide worshippers with social intercourse between equals
and near-equals. These rituals are thus carefully structured so that
various groups famous for their stiff arrogance are never paired off with
partners who are from much lower ranks of society. Thus, the Vriddi of
Fasiltum, the aristocrats of the Cloak of Asure Gems, etc. are usually
seated where they can mix with people of similar rank and station. If one
of these great lords or ladies actually sees a lower class person with whom
they wish to have a ritual sexual relation (or just a plain oldfashioned
sexual relation), they may try to find a way to "buy" the love-object or
induce him/her to accept "inducements" in exchange for favours. This is
considered all right. If the woman doesn't chew her Lisutl root and
produces a child, the upper-class father may pay her something as a gift
for the child (she has no right to "sue" him). Upper-class fathers have also
been known to have unwanted offspring quietly killed, but this is abnormal
because such children have no rights to the father's property whatsoever.

Slaves and the lowest clans have few rights: a slave "lover" (male or
female) can be passed to a guest for the night without any social
inconvenience. The slave has no freedom of choice.

>Are there other large social events that might serve this purpose?  My
>impression is that the 5 Empires at least have nothing like Euro cultures'
>carnivals or feasts of misrule.

This is accurate. The Tsolyani do not relax in public since to appear "out
of character" is interpreted as a loss of nobility and a lowering of
station. The ritual masks of Lord Ksarul are worn for religious reasons; no
Tsolyani would  appear masked at a Hallowe'en party -- that would not be
"noble." Making a fool of oneself is a quick way of losing your clan's,
family's, relatives', etc. respect for you.

Hope this answers -- and raises -- a few questions.

Phil

It does indeed, thanks!

Extremely stratified and ritualized Earth cultures generally have some sort of
safety valve, either official or not.  In Japan, for example, they have drink.
(It's my understanding that you are not blamed for what you do while drunk, and
are in fact expected to act like an idiot.)  In medieval England, they had
feasts of misrule, and other specific holidays during which you could act nuts
and blow off steam.  In India, they not only have some "officially" wild
holidays, like Diwali, where people seem to get badly out of control, but they
also apparently have regularly-scheduled street riots in New Delhi.  In Bali (I
think), they didn't have anything culture-wide, but individuals could go Amok.
University of Michigan students riot when our teams win national titles, and
every year, on the last day of classes, thousands of students strip naked and
run a mile through campus, aided by much alcohol.  The list goes on...

It *seems* to be a general principle that, if you have a society under constant
social pressure to behave "well," it will either have formal escape valves for
human misbehavior -- or humans will create their own escape valves when things
get unbearable.  If that isn't too broad an assumption, then the lack of formal
opportunities to misbehave without repercussions in Tsolyanu would seem to
suggest that occasional informal eruptions might be the rule.  Is this, for
example, part of the cause of the annual Jakalla Food Riots?  Or do things
"happen" more often than we're told, and get hushed up by the clans?

Or am I making far too broad an assumption about human cultures?  (I admit that
I'm not trained in cultural anthropology.)

Some mention of the other nation's more noted units are brushed over in the

You are pretty correct about escape valves in different societies around
the world. Many rather stiff and formal cultures do "blow loose" on certain
occasions.

In Hindu India, it is not so much Diwali (the feast of lights) as the
spring festival of Holi, when young fellows gather in the streets to spray
each other with dyed water, and generally raise a bit of trouble. Holi is
largely celebrated by town-city middle-class youths, but it does tend to
spread amongst other groups as well. The third festival is Dashera, in
which great paper effigies of the demon Ravan are carried through the
streets and joyfully burned to commemorate the slaying of the demon by Ram
and Lakhsman, who thus rescued Ram's wife, Sita.

Sunni Muslims in India have the two 'Eid festivals: feasting getting new
clothes, going to the public prayers. Shi'ah Muslims have the great
commemoration of Muharram, mourning the death of the Prophet's
grandson,Imam Husein. Men carry models of Husein's tomb through the
streets, beat their breasts, and eventually end by burning the models
ceremonially at a graveyard outside the city. Some exuberant fellows
actually flog themselves with whips and chains, sometimes to the point of
unconsciousness. I have also seen Shi'ah youths walk on blazing coals and
perform other feats.

There is probably more scope for "letting one's hair down" in Tsolyanu than
there is in many Terran societies: hunting, wrestling, gladiatorial games,
drinking, gaming, and a fairly unfettered view of sex, all provide escape
valves. You want a little wildness? Try a picnic with a dozen Dlamelish
priestesses! Or a quiet whingding with their "Sisters in the Emerald," the
pretty acolytes of Lady Hrihayal's temple -- if you are not afraid of
coming back covered with welts and scars!

>Or am I making far too broad an assumption about human cultures?  (I admit
>that
>I'm not trained in cultural anthropology.)

There are certainly societies in which unfettered raucousness and riot are
*not* favoured or countenanced, but almost everybody has a "way out." Many
of the religious festivals described in Bob Alberti's "Mitlanyal" are just
that: they have features that permit various levels of "looseness" and
"ingotmality."

Alas, none was ever completed. I did *want* to do histories and guidebeooks
for the other nations, but life kept getting in the way! I did complete a
history of Engsvanyalu, which is now on the Blue Room ftp site. I also
included fairly copious materials in the Sourcebook -- but not to the same
level as "Deeds," Sorry!

I did publish "The Book of Ebon Bindings," dealing with demonology, and
another booklet on the Sunuz language and magic system, also up on the ftp
site. These, again, are interesting but do not offer the kind of
historical-military coverage you wish.

I have a question for the Prof. and for anyone else who has an
opinion.  Perhaps, Bob Alberti could comment as it is on religion or
possibly religious philosophy.  

Does the Stability/Change dichotomy really represent a fundamental concept
of Tsolyani philosophy (or indeed popular psychology) as the division of
the Tsolyani pantheon implies?  Although it's there as a division of the
Gods, are there other manifestations in Tsolyani life?  I can't think of
any clear ones but why would the Tsolyani (and only the Tsolyani ?)
construct this symmetry in their religious world view if it didn't arise
from or relate to a more general view of this split in the nature of the
world or how they perceive it?

Do Tsolyani look for a Stability/Change balance or imbalance in their
lives?  Rather than feeling in two minds when they can't decide on
something might they think that their restless Change side was busiest
today such that it was dominating their Stable side? 

Or, for example, if your clan's Chlen herd was frightenly restless one day
would you think,

a) Hmm. They didn't enjoy the slops bucket today.

b) Oh. The weather must be changing.

c) The Change demons are pricking their hides today. We're in for some
trouble.

Greetings all,

I'd like to know what sources there are for information on the flora and
fauna of Tekumel.  I have copies of the Bestiary, vol 1 of the Swords &
Glory Sourcebook (the Gamescience version) and the novels, but I know
nothing of the less accessible essays and defunct periodicals.  I'm hoping
to write some contributions of my own (I'm a biologist, and enjoy thinking
about alien ecologies), but I don't want to overlap or infringe on others'
efforts. 

Also, could Dr. Barker or others suggest what texts or learned sages a
Tsolyani scholar might refer to for knowledge of the "natural" world?  I
would imagine that the libraries of the Temples of Avanthe and Thumis
would be most helpful (and perhaps of Ksarul if one were privy to such
things), but I would be glad to know of classic works, famous savants, or
obscure tomes of wisdom that might exist.

Many thanks,

George Hammond

days, but everyone doesn't use the same email program and system type.  This
leads to a couple of problems.  I either have to edit them out (I am looking

turn off the HTML response generator of your mailer if it has that option.

There are quite a few people who use text based email systems still.  I don't

I don't want to prevent people from sending me stuff, but if you do send it

I have an idea.  In the interest of injecting some Vrayani irony or Kurt 
Hills crudity into the conversation,  what about doing some mock surveys 
of the inhabitants of foreigners quarters?  For instance, citizens of the 
various Empires and non-human enclaves could be polled on questions 
regarding sex, politics, religion, customs, hygiene, cuisine, etc.  An 
arbitrarily representative response could be printed for each  each group.

For example:  A selection of the higher status inhabitants of the Bey Su 
foreigners quarter were asked the following question:  "What is foreplay ?"  
The responses included the following.

A Salarvyani male: "Waking up."

A Salarvyani Female: "Meeting an attractive blind person."

A N'luss male: "Brace yourself Byorzda !"

A N'luss female: "Finding a room with a high ceiling."

A Mu'ugalavyani male: "What's foreplay ?

A Mu'ugalavyani female:  "Eye-contact with a foreigner."

A Ghatoni male: "Paying a low price for her."

A male from the Kurt Hills:  Why the f--- don't you go to the Temple of 
       Dlamelish and ask them to show you."

A female from the Kurt Hills:  "Drop your kilt; I like scribes."

A male Vrayani:  "Lying to those who take surveys."

A female Vrayani:  "Laying in unquestioned repose."

The preceding survey does not necessarily reflect the opinions of any 
servant of the Palace of the Realm, the anonymous respondents, their 
relatives, legally declared friends or any agents of the Omnipotent 
Azure Legion present or observing at the time.

[Moderator's Note:  James Maliszewski gives a progress report on his web site.]

I'd like to thank everyone who made suggestions and gave me advice about my
forthcoming Tekumel website. I very much appreciated this.

As things stand right now, the website isn't a high priority for me. I have
a dissertation to complete as well as other more mundane chores. Needless to
say, my time will be somewhat limited. Nevertheless, I do expect the site to
go online sometime during the summer. I hope it's before July, but I make no
promises.

The site will concentrate on roleplaying in Tekumel. Included online will be
variant rules (for Gardasiyal mostly) that I use (as well as others),
character sheets, NPC descriptions, locales, and adventure seeds. I'll also
try to include setting information that isn't easily found elsewhere. While
most Tekumel websites are devoted to the world of Tekumel itself, I intend
this one to be dedicated to the world as a setting for gaming. That is,
after all, why I am interested in Tekumel.

When the site goes online, I'll make certain to inform the mailing list.

Thanks again,
James Maliszewski

I have long taken pleasure in the wonderful maps of Tekumel included with
both Swords & Glory and now Gardasiyal. They're simply wonderful to look at
and have a great deal of flavor to them.

When I realize that these maps detail only one continent of one hemisphere,
I find my imagination wandering off into the "terra incognita" of Tekumel,
the unexplored places that even the Professor has never described.

I'd be curious to hear if anyone has ever run adventures or campaigns
centered around the exploration of the unknown lands of Tekumel. From hints
here and there, it certainly seems as if the Thursday Night Group has had
run-ins with visitors from beyond Tsolyanu's continent. I'd love to hear
more about others' thoughts on this matter.

[                   state.  The Professor replies.                           ]

>Are there any areas under the sea in Engsvan hla Ganga that might have
>been preserved?  Given the pocket created by Fu Shi'i under the sea

Where Ganga once stood is now at the bottom of a rather shallow bay, filled
with alluvial mud brought down by the Missuma River. You can still see the
tops of broken towers and tumbled walls when the water is clear, and there
are guides and tourist boats that will take you out there and show you what
they call "the great palace" and the "Temple of Pavar," and a host of other
wonders. A few wizards have underwater breathing capabilities (actually
openings to other Planes where there is air) and have trod the mosaic
floors of the Priestkings' pavilions. Much of whatever was there has been
looted or buried in mud. Much has been ruined, too: the guides usually
point down into the water at a round-domed squat tower and tell the
tourists that this is the Imperial library. One of the wizards then wrote
that he had personally visited that building and had found nothing there
but waterlogged paper and ruined bookbindings, But he also said that he saw
"boxes of metal" and chests -- perhaps waterproof?

Gems and gold and other wealth have all been systematically looted from
sunken Ganga. Some was rescued by the Priestkings' minions themselves,
other stuff was scavenged by local boys diving for it, and still more has
been acquired since by other means. There is probably not much left on the
surface of the sea-bottom. There may indeed be air-filled chambers
somewhere down there, and really complex
tunnel systems fed with air from the Planes Beyond are possible. If these
exist, they are well guarded and concealed.

I did read somewhere that the Temple of Sarku maintains a sub-sea shrine
down in the ancient Engsvanyali catacombs -- in honour of the myriad dead
buried there.

[Moderator's Note:  Charlie Goering asks a series of questions about how   ]
[                   Legions make their camps in the field.                 ]

>1/ When Legions are in the field and make camp do they operate like the
>ancient Roman Legions and build a camp following a standard pattern each
>night? I assume such labor would be noble as part of a soldier's duty.

Military camps are indeed fairly standard when operating in similar
terrain. A perimeter is established and defended with a ditch, stakes (if
available), and timber towers and walls, if materials are there. A wall of
adobe or sod is also common in some parts of the Empire. Soldiers
themselves are used as a labour force in areas where local labour is
insufficient, but if the peasantry can be hired to do the job, they may be
brought along on an expedition and given these tasks. In some places slaves
have been employed, and prisoners of war have been used, too, though this
usually costs more effort in guard duty than it is worth. At the Siege of
Mmillaka in 1,218 the Emperor ordered all of the local brothels emptied and
the girls put to work carrying baskets of dirt and stone. After the siege
there were some *very* strong young women to ply their trade!

>2/ Is the construction of field fortifications handeld by the line troops when
>ther are no sappers in the area, or is local labor conscripted for the task?

See above. If a sapper unit is available, it will be asked to do the
technical tasks. Local peasants do the slob labour, and regular soldiers
perform such jobs as setting up tents, arranging for commissariats, etc.
Slaves and/or lower-class labourers dig latrines, stable Chlen-beasts, and
build fortifications. This is not written down in Imperial law, but custom
and usage have made these arrangements pretty uniform. Officers (Captain
and above) rarely work at any of this; these tasks are not seen as "noble"
for the aristocracy.

>3/ If a Legion was building a camp or field fortification, would it be fair to
>assume that the line troopers would do the building and the officers would be
>supervising (a la "Bridge on the River Kwai")?

Yes, if no local labour or large bodies of slaves or war prisoners were
available.

>4/ Is the repair of damaged armor and weapons handled within the individual
>Legion (if so, is there a seperate armorers sub-unit?) or are unservicable
>items sent to a central depot for repair?

Legions always have a number of soldiers detailed to repair damaged armour
and weapons. These are housed near the centre of a legion encampment, and
soldiers bring their gear there to be refurbished. Legion smiths are not
usually asked to make *new* weapons; these are bought from contractors in
one of the cities where the legion has its main headquarters.

>5/ Does each Legion have their own medical section/field hospital, and how 
>good is battlefield medicine, and how does quality vary from Legion to Legion?

Priests of Ketengku march along with many legions, even those of "Change."
Some units do not give their wounded and sick over to these specialists,
however, preferring their own dubious brand of treatment: e.g. ask any
soldier what he thinks about "Vimuhla surgeons." Amputation and cauterising
in the Flame are prescribed for many causes. The old adage has it:
"Servants of the Flame had best not get headaches!"

>6/ Are courts-martial considered to be Imperial Courts? Aside from the common
>punishment of impalement for major crimes, what could lesser offenders expect
>as punishment?

Courts-martial are performed by the legions themselves, under the scrutiny
of Imperial agents (there are usually a few with every legion). If there
are important questions in the matter, it will be taken out of Legion hands
and handled by the nearest major Palace of the Realm (or Palace of the
Priesthoods in religious issues). Really tricky problems are sent on up to
Avanthar. Most lesser offences -- insubordination, failing to perform a
task, etc. are handled by the legions themselves with flogging, the
pillory, and/or imprisonment. More serious crimes are punished by impaling
or other means. Sleeping on duty, deserting a post, stealing, cheating
one's comrades, etc. are some of the common crimes. For really serious
executions, the legion may call in a Mrikh, a special unit of four
specialists; cf. "Flamesong."

>7/ Now that the succession has been settled, is Emperor Mirusiya planning to
>liberate the rest of the Chakas from the Mu'ugalavyani? If so, the 22nd Heavy
>Infantry is a natural choice as we call the region home.

Your legion will probably be sent. Nobody yet knows what military plans the
new God-Emperor has, but the Mu'ugalavyani have been observed strenthening
walls and fortifications all along the frontier. They have also deployed
most of their Pe Choi legions down to Livyanu and brought home more of
their loyal human troops. They may know something I don't.

In Volume I of "Swords and Glory" published by "Different Worlds," there is
a brown-paper centrefold map of the province names. There are no city
names, so you'll have to overlay this map with one showing towns and
roads; the biggest town in each province is usually the capital, where the
Governor has his palace, entourage, barracks, etc.

Provincial administration is handled from the governor's palace, down
through the local Palace of the Realm, and to the town mayors, and thence
to the village headmen. Most provinces have their own labour forces,
constabulary, Sakbe-road police, secondary road police, etc. There are not
many other social services, although some provinces maintain builders and
sanitation units. THere is a liaison between the province's governor and
military headquarters with the legions established in that province, too.
The temples also maintain representatives at each governor's court to deal
with religious matters and solve disputes: e.g. the temple of Belkhanu last
year was instrumental in mediating a dispute between the Temple of Hru'u
and the Temple of Avanthe over who could use the main avenue through
Jakalla on a certain day for a religious procession. (The decision was
solved in favour of the Goddess since her sect *required* a ceremony on
just that day, while the Temple of Hru'u had three or four alternate
choices.)

>one?

These are two competing theories. There is no "hard evidence" one way or
the other. I should have stated this in one of the printed sources. One
cannot "ask" a Ssu or Hluss anything, and the Churstalli themselves do not
communicate with any but their own kind. No archaeological "digs" have ever
been done in Gashchne or farther out on the Plain of Towers. Such would be
hazardous, and most Mu'ugalavyani see no purpose to such non-practical
questions.

The identification with the Ssu and Hluss is based, perhaps, more on the
Churstalli's number and placement of limbs and their general appearance,
rather than on "hard science." On the other hand, the Pe Choi deny any
relationship to them, saying that they sense no kinship with these beasts.
There is also a scholar in the Temple of Ksarul at Jakalla, one Balai
hiChankolun, who theorises that the Churstalli are the remnants of a great
race that arrived "from the Lost Home of the Gods" (a common Ksarul myth
for "who knows?") via the "towers" (the ships that stand empty and alone on
the Plane of Towers). His idea is that these beasts were once bred and
modified to serve as guardians and warriors, but that they have now
"de-evolved" to less than their original state. It's a nice theory, and it
is the cause of some controversy.

>Among the many wonderful aspects of Tekumel are the fascinating non-humans.

>He's mentioned a few, by name, which did not (as far as we know) make it to

You're asking a very large question, one that I could write dissertations
on! There are hundreds -- thousands -- of species of animals, plants, and
"critters" that are just not mentioned in any of the sources. This is
because (a) we didn't need them for the game, (b) I didn't need them in the
novels or publications, (c) I do not know enough about technical
zoology/botany and other biological matters to get them right. I "see"
Tekumel: shut my eyes and almost visually "see" shapes and colours. Thus,
if a new animal is encountered, I shut my eyes, and there it is. How it
*works* technically is often beyond me!

>He's mentioned a few, by name, which did not (as far as we know) make it to
>Tekumel and survive to the present.

Which ones did I mention that are not somewhere described? I can tell you
what they look like and some other details.

>Perhaps he could offer us some descriptions of these beings. Are they
>likely to be encountered elsewhere?
>ON other planes of existence perhaps?

Other Planes are much harder to describe than Tekumel's. Sometimes their
flora and fauna are so alien that I can't do more than stare at the colours
and shapes!

>Also could he offer some more descriptions of the other planes and other
>worlds that were popped into the pocket dimensions.

Another dissertation! I wish I could write it, but time and old age
conspire to keep me from it.

[Moderator's Note:  Thomas Worthington updates us on his Tekumel web site.   ]

Chris & Everyone on the mailing list,

As some of you will have noticed, the Guide to Tekumel project
at my web page (www.ncl.ac.uk/~n6388131/home.htm) has ground to 
a halt while I was engaged in my second year at university. I
intended to get back to it this easter but my hard drive died
on me and I lost all my back "issues" of the mailing list. In order
to get back to the guide, which I was enjoying working on even
though it's quite a big task, I need a copy of the messages I've 
missed. Can anyone help?
[Moderator's Note:  I'll get Thomas the back messages.  Do you need them all?]

On the subject of Vulcans in post-movie Star Trek, there was an
episode of STNG on the other night with a Vulcan in it & I got a 
good look at her costume. The costume itself is very Tekumelani 
but the sigil on here headress was only superficially Tsolyani,
it did not match any of the published characters.

This brings me to a final point - is there a postscript version
of the Tsolyani fonts available. I know of a version of the 
public domain typesetting program TeX which handles arabic characters,
and it may be possible to use the Tsolyani fonts with it to produce
high-quality printouts for games, or even publications for that 
matter.

[Moderator's Note:  Check out the fonts directory of the web site.  There are]

[                   the non-human races of Tekumel.                           ]

>I have a couple of questions about the non-human races. First of
>all, we know that the Shen divide themselves up according to
>egg-groups, hence the variety of smaller nations besides Shenyu,
>and the Pe Choi seem to be divided (by village?) among the "wild"

>The Hlaka seem to be divided according to eyries, but do these

>recognize political distinctions among themselves?

The "wild" Pe Choi are separatists -- from all human society. They tend to
slaughter human soldiers sent in to "rule" them. They do let human
merchants go free, on the other hand, or charge them "tolls."

It is very hard to write dissertations on the other races. Each one is
different! The Hlaka, for example, see their eyries as separately governed
by elders, but they don't seem to have come up with "nationalism." A Hlaka
from one eyrie can fly to a different one and settle down, if food is
scarce at his home eyrie, or if no mates are available there. It is said
that the Pygmy Folk "cities" (warrens, really) are similarly structured,
but nobody knows for sure.


>The other question is regarding the designations for the non-humans:
>are the names for these races the closest approximations that
>humanity can come to pronouncing their names for themselves, or
>were they names that humanity simply applied to them during the
>history of their association?

Mostly the latter. A few -- Ahoggya, Pachi Lei, Pe Choi -- are *said* to be
poor renditions of the species' original names for themselves. Some
scholars think "Pe Choi" comes from "Pav Khoi," which means "Fearsome
Being" in one of the N'luss dialects.

>Do these names vary across the Five
>Empires, as the designation for the Pygmy Folk (Nininyal/Nyena),
>Swamp Folk (Heglethyal/A'lathish) or Shunned Ones (Vleshgayal/
>Blashagh), or do all nations that are aware of them refer to,
>e.g. the Ahoggya, by that name? If these names are human designations,
>could Phil provide approximations of their self-designations?

Most of these names are indeed human approximations, modified by millennia
of mispronunciation and misunderstanding. For example, the Nininyal are
called "Little Ones" in Livyani, N'luss, etc. but in Salarvyani they are
termed "Hurozhte," which translates vaguely as "buried ones."

The names differ across the Five Empires and beyond. I focus on Tsolyanu,
of course, so that the names used there tend to become more central than
other nations'.

Ask an Ahoggya what it calls its own race, and you're likely to get a crude
and  rude reply: e.g. "we don't insult your funny little species, so why
insult us? 'Ahoggya' is good enough!" -- plus possibly a heap of Ahoggya
dung on your shoes...

The Shen say their name was given to them by the humans of southern Livyanu
long ago. There is now no trace of a "Shen" word in modern Livyani, and it
may be Duru'ob or even Sunuz. The Shen themselves use a variety of terms
which are hard to transcribe (and pronounce). They seem to treat different
egg groups as different "nationalities" or even "species." Ask a Shen for
the species of another Shen, and it will probably reply, "What egg-group
does he/she/it belong to?" Or "What city does it come from?" There is a
rather simplistic nationalism throughout Shenyu and the other little Shen
states that depends upon egg-group relations.

Over the years many players (and referees!) have tried to get parties into
the unexplored and unmapped vastnesses of Tekumel. This has largely been a
failure because of various reasons. The Thursday night group recently did
manage to go over the North Pole and explore some of the terrain opposite
Yan Kor. They can perhaps describe this better than I can since I tend to
forget where they went and in what sequence. If Bob or Keith want to speak
up, please do so!

[Moderator's Note:  Yes, a travel-log would be well received guys!           ]

I have several times suggested that would-be Tekumel authors should pick a
region on the planet and describe it in detail, instead of doing something
on the well-known Tekumelani societies I have already detailed. It is
easier and more useful to "do new," rather than add to the old. I might not
like the "new" creation, but with an infinity of Other Planes available, I
think there is room. Anything that strikes me as "un-Tekumelani" I can
myself ignore, while including materials I find appealing. People are
always welcome to innovate in their own campaigns -- and publish the
results on the Blue Room!

I am at a loss to reply to this sort of technical, scientific question. I
can "see" flowers and plants, and I can ask the peasants what these are
used for -- but if you ask me how they reproduce, what types of dirt they
require, how much water they need, etc. etc. I am at a complete loss. Many
times during our Thursday night games a plant will come up, for which I
give a thumbnail description. One or more of the players then wants a more
complete statement, and I do my best. It is never enough, however! I must
thus ask those of you who enjoy this kind of thing to use whatever is
published and write up your own flora and fauna. I'll help, if I can, but I
don't have a lot of energy left and would much rather spend it on some
facet of Tekumel that interests me more. If you do write an article, I urge
you to let me see it, then send it on to Chris or Carl Brodt for
publication!

The Temple of Avanthe has various books in the Goddess' great library in
Bey Su that deal with plants and animals. Most of these are "practical,"
rather than "theoretical," however: when to plant, when to reap, how to
fertilise and water, plus what practical uses (sometimes wildly incorrect)
the plant can be put to,

See above. I would have to check with the scholar priests/priestesses of
Avanthe's sect and see what they use. In any case, they don't seem to have
a "scientific approach" to this subject in modern American/European terms.

Thumis has more theoretical stuff (though still not scientific in our
terms, and Ksarul is good for drugs, poisons, and killer-plants. I'll look
for further basic works, if any. There probably were many such books before
the Time of Darkness and the Latter Times, but most of these have either
perished or become forgotten and unreadable by now.

My source is "The Known History of Tekumel" 
        a very interesting document

the noisome tripedal Popo of Beta Aquilae
the shaggy Umpleb from Delta Aquilae
the insidious Bahk Muhk from Denebola

and 

Still other species were found in the farther reaches of space. . .

[Moderator's Note:  Gordon Neff asks about the Plain of Towers.             ]

This may be an 'as you like it' question, but then, there may be an
established answer, too.

[Moderator's Note:  None that I know of.                                    ]

Let's say that I have undergone the staggering difficulty, danger and 
hardship over many months (at least the equivalent of striking out for
Nepal from Paris on foot), and at last, windburned and tattered, I reach
the Plain of Towers.  Wandering among these massive, cryptic monuments
looming in the morning mist... What would I see?

In short, what condition are they in? Is there a relic or an Eye
that would allow entrance? In what condition is the interior?

Again, it could be worked any number of ways, but I'm guessing that
there is at least a jotted note on this.

P.S.   Have they got rocket fins, 1950s 'Conquest of Space' fashion?

Regarding someone with a new religion who decides that he must
'witness to the multitudes':

<<Another and common solution is laughter: jeer at him and prove he is
"insane" and should be cared for by his clan and original temple. Ridicule
works about as often as capital punishment. Only if he really started to
gain power would he be "offed.">>

No, he wouldn't. Instant martyr.

I'm in South Carolina, and I knew some people who at the time were
planning a little visit to Jerry Falwell's Capitol Building/church
headquarters. It might be thought that they'd seen a few too many episodes
of 'Mission Impossible,' but they had the minivan, the grey coveralls, and
this little bottle of LSD...

The plan was simple-- get in posing as electricians while nothing
is going on, paint the podium liberally with this colorless, odorless
fluid, and leave. That's all.

Under the hot klieg lights, sweaty palms rub the edges of the
podium...  and about ten minutes into his 'sermon,' he starts making less
and less sense-- gets more and more vehement in the exposition of
non-sequiturs and utter gibberish...

It could be a good five, ten minutes before someone thinks to shut
it off. In an hour or so he'd be himself again, no ill effects... but it
would all be over. He would be finished.

For the record, they decided against the attempt.

But if they'd had a SPELL to do the same thing, from a distance, now...

Arthur Clarke once wrote, "How long would Adolph Hitler have lasted
if every hour of the day and night a little voice was whispering in his
ear? Or a constant tone, loud enough to banish sleep?"

Oh, no, -killing- him would be the last thing they'd do.

[Moderator's Note:  I doubt they would have had to.  Making the person Nakome ]
[                   would probably be all that is necessary (and threaten the ]
[                   same to potential worshippers).                           ]

[Moderator's Note:  Gordon Neff writes about some interesting methods of naval]
[                   protection and propulsion (actually they would probably   ]
[                   apply to land based situations as well).                  ]

Can a magically powered equivalent of a cannon be built to work more
economically than a mage at sea throwing about the same amount of force 
the same distance ?

Can you believe I haven't touched cannabis sativa in years ?

I've never dared do this in a game, but years ago I figured that if
you conjured up a powerful but none-too-swift Fire Elemental and confined
him within a chamber submerged in a cauldron, you would have yourself a
'thaumaturgical steam engine.'

You'd certainly have the makings of a great steam cannon, too--
after a few disastrous experiments.

One of the cleverest things about Tekumel is this whole 'absence of
metals' thing. Not only does it utterly preclude any sort of yawn-Tolkien
or rosy-colored European knockoffs, it also produces interesting
consequences in its own right.

Chlen hide may be harder than bronze, but 'hardness' is its only
resemblance to metal-- it won't hold fire, and it won't conduct
electricity. Even if a Reformation did lead to a scientific, 'let's find
out' view of the world, Tekumel would never produce a Benjamin Franklin--
though it might produce a Newton.

[Moderator's Note:  Gordon Neff responds to George's biology questions.    ]

"I'm hoping to write some contributions of my own (I'm a biologist, and 
enjoy thinking about alien ecologies), but I don't want to overlap or 
infringe on others' efforts."

Doc, you just established better bona fides than anyone from whom
you're likely to hear. Seems to me, you ought to be the one -establishing-
the 'official info.'

I would only point out that considering how multi-legged all the
various sentient species are, virtually every mammalian form encountered
ought to have at least six. (Only we would have brought four-legged
species, dogs &c.)

I don't recall as I sit here if any such thing has been developed,
but you must have a gasbag creature with dangling tentacles. It's an SF
staple since the 1930s. Usually it produces hydrogen through an enzymatic
process and anchors itself to trees in high winds.
