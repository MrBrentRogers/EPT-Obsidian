These messages are the accumulation of the messages that were sent out on 
the Blue Room email list between May 1995 and June 2000.  A large portion 
of the information is directly from Professor M.A.R Barker. When the list 
members joined during the time the list was active, they agreed to refrain 
from sharing this data with non list members.  When the list ended, it was 
urged that the data be made available to non-list Tekumel fans, and it 
seemed like a good idea all around.

I only ask that if you download these digests, or have received them in 
some other way, please respect the agreements the list members made, and 
refrain from passing them around and instead point people to the Tekumel

[Moderator's Note:  Peter Bismire submits the following on the weaponry of  ]
[                   Tekumel.                                                ]

I have previously introduced my Jakallan friend Muresh hiPagartra.
Recently he took me on a tour of his old legions' barracks and we
discussed more on various weaponry of Tekumel.

We were being carried on his palanquin when the talk turned to missile
weapons other than bows-

"You ask me about what you call a "bolas" but we name a chreghakh? In
Tsolyanu only the Ksarul worshippers in Heketh's Purdimal legion use it
as a war weapon, although it is popular for hunting in the swamps
surrounding that city and in other places.

"It consists of a cord, or thong, with a stone ball fastened to each
end. The balls are either sewn up in pieces of leather which are
fastened to the cord, or the latter is passed around a groove cut in the
balls and tied. Usually a second cord with a stone ball attached is
fastened to the middle of the first. In such cases the third ball is
often smaller than the other two and is held in the hand when the weapon
is used.

"When used it is whirled around the head until the outer ball has
attained sufficient velocity and then thrown so as to strike the legs of
the target. The balls tangle the cords about the victim and thus
disables it.

"A chreghakh with two balls is referred to as a "gabunikh" (twin) one
with three balls is nick-named a "nakome" (bastard). I think this last
was named by someone who tried to use it for the first time and was more
tangled than their target!

"On the northern edges of the Tsechelnu Swamps the locals use a similar,
but much lighter, weapon for fowling. It has from four to ten (usually
six) bone weights fastened to cords four and a half to nearly six hoikh
in length, the opposite ends of the cords being fastened to a short
wooden handle. The weights are generally ovoid or spherical. I have been
told that wealthier individuals have theirs carved in the shapes of
animals and birds. They are carried, specially knotted, in a pouch
attached to the hunter's belt and frequently a man has more than one
set.

"When a flock of birds is seen approaching, the handle is grasped in the
right hand , the balls in the left, and the strings straightened by a
quick pull. Letting go with the left hand, the balls are whirled around
the head and let fly at the passing flock. This weapon is effective up
to thirty dhaibakh.

Muresh later showed me a chreghakh from the Legion of Heketh of
Purdimal. It followed the "nakome" design having two large and one
smaller ball. All the leatherwork had been dyed dark blue and the
leather pouches in which the stones sat were painted with sigils in
black. Muresh believed these were magical to aid the aim of the wielder
and suggested that the stones themselves might be either blue or painted
that colour and also be decorated.

“I mentioned legion arrow colours before? Heketh’s use a blue shaft with
black fletching. These fletching are the flight feathers of a large
breed of crow that lives in the Swamps. Their bows are a local style
which I consider to be underpowered but again they are decorated with
many magical designs which are supposed to improve their accuracy and
truth to tell the archers of this legion are good shots.

During the tour of the barracks we visited the Legions museum, The Hall
of Excellent Remembering's, and Muresh showed me the statue dedicated to
the original Girikteshmu for whom the Legion is named. The statue itself
was not as large as I had imagined, say about one and a half times
man-height. It is cast in gold which is supposed to have been obtained
from the earrings of the dead Salarvyani buried beneath it. It is
centred on a large dais which covers these Salarvyani heads that were
brought back in 1340 (3,023 according to Muresh). It is the centre of
the Legions activities and special ceremonies are held here whenever it
marches off to war and when it returns. Here also new recruits are
"blooded" (literally) into the unit. I would have liked to have seen the
Great Kaing from the War of 2020 but it was not permitted due to my not
being a member of the Legion.

Other trophies and monuments though existed in plenty. One in particular
caught my eye. A group of half a dozen Hlutrgu heads decorated with
masks grimaced from below an arc of alternating double-headed spears and
arrows.

"This I can tell you about," said Muresh.

"It was about 20 years ago and I was a newly appointed Tirrikamu. The
Hlutrgu had been raiding eastern Kaija particularly heavily. A mixed
force consisting of several cohorts from different Jakallan legions,
including two of ours, had been sent to back up the locals.

"It was hard work as much as hard fighting as they contrived to be where
we weren't and much marching would only lead us to already burnt-out and
destroyed villages.

"One day my Kasi called me and instructed me to take mine and another
semetl and about a hundred local levies and investigate a previously
raided area in case they had doubled back on us.

"After marching all morning and much of the afternoon we were
approaching a low ridge when suddenly one of my scouts came bounding
over the top as if he was being pursued by demons - as he was! Over a
thousand of the little horrors came over the ridge following him
straight towards us.

"There was an old walled villa nearby that had been destroyed sometime
in the past but still seemed to be solid enough. Yelling orders I got my
men sprinting towards it. Fortunately the creatures are not as fast out
of water as we are and so we actually gained some ground on them. As
soon as we were inside I set some of the levies to barricading the
gateway and placed my archers in position on the walls.

"Some of the levies were bowmen but most were armed with the local style
of spear you see there. It is called a rijutha (paralyser) and is
designed to handle Hlutrgu. It has two barbed blades of unequal length.
When stabbed with the longer blade a Hlutrgu is powerless as he cannot
withdraw on account of the barbed tip, and the sharp point of the
shorter blade prevents it running up the spear and killing its user as
has frequently been done.

"Fortunately we had the gate adequately blocked by the time they caught
up and the first rush was easily turned as they were out of breath with
running and our archers shot down many as they rushed in, breaking the
force of their charge. After this they drew off to a safe distance and
reorganised while we strengthened our make-shift fortress.

"After a while they formed up again and came racing in. The walls seemed
to disconcert them and they made their main effort at the gate. Again we
repelled them but not without casualties.

"The villa itself was roofless but the ceiling of the ground floor was
largely intact and again the place was stout walled and I resolved that
if the creatures got over the outer walls I would make a stand there.
One problem I soon had to face was water, as we could see no sign of a
well and were rapidly parching in the heat.

"Their next attack was more cunning, while one group again attacked the
gate, others held back and rained javelins into the space behind. Have
you seen their javelins? As vicious as their makers and barbed so the
only way to remove them is by cutting them out or pushing through the
head.

"Despite this we beat them off again and took stock. The archers were
rapidly running out of arrows and the water was all gone. To add to our
woes night was starting to fall and they can see better in the dark than
a man.

"And then a small miracle for which I thank Lord Karakan! One of my men
who had been instructed to make the villa ready for defence moved a
fallen roof beam and discovered a trap-door. Opening this he descended
into a cellar which not only contained a well but a large number of
storage jars still full of oil!

"Instead of attacking right on dusk the Hlutrgu had withdrawn again and
seemed to be performing some sort of ceremony. A dull drumming could be
heard and slow rising and falling cadence of noise. We feared that by
the end of this night they might be making new drums out of our skins!

"Guessing that they might not attack until the ceremony was complete I
pulled all my men back to the villa and readied the oil jars on what was
left of the roof with small torches set close by.

"About midnight with Kashi the only moon visible, but low on the
horizon, they attacked again. At first they must have been confused by
no resistance at the walls or gate and hesitated. Then guessing we had
pulled back they rushed forward again.

"I then ordered oil to poured over their heads and torches to be hurled.
This broke their attack and many were killed by the fire or my men
reaching out and "tickling" them with their spears while they were
distracted.

"They now set down and tried the javelin rain on us but we were
adequately protected so that few hits were made. Still we were rapidly
coming to the end of our strength and wondered how much longer we could
hold them. By this time about half my men were dead or wounded and many
had at least a cut or two.

“As the sun rose my legionaries and I sang our song of welcome to its’
rays, especially as we expected not to see it set. With the improving
light I could see that the Hlutrgu were packed into the villas’
courtyard while again their “leader-priests” capered up and down in
front of them building them up for an attack. While reduced by the
fighting there still appeared to be nearly 800 or so left and I new a
good solid charge would overwhelm my few remaining men.

“Resolved to die bravely we had paused to put the aphorism “before
fighting look to your helmet ties” into action, when suddenly the
sounding of trumpets from outside the walls set the grey mass of our
enemies seething.

“Our troops had been led on by first the glow of the burning oil and
then the smoke from smouldering fires until they had arrived and
surrounded the villa. The Hlutrgu suddenly surged towards the gate only
to be met by a volley of arrows. This drove them back inside but now our
archers were being boosted to the top of the walls and were firing down
into the creatures. With such a mass every arrow seemed to score a mark
and the slaughter was fearsome. Eventually a cohort of Serqu’s “Swords”
charged through the gate and the battle was won.

“I received a Gold of Glory and this. . . .  “ he pointed to a dark scar
running along his forearm which was almost purple in comparison with his
reddish skin. “If it was not for healing magic I would have probably
lost the use, if not the whole arm. As it was many of us were severely
afflicted or died from even minor wounds and I was delirious for about
two weeks and weak as a kitten for two more months. Thank the Gods that
the Weaver of Skeins had not made a deeper cut in my thread then.

[Moderator's Note:  Bob Alberti provides us with Arjai's first hand report of]
[                   the Tsolyani Kolumejalim (Part 1).                       ]

On the morning of 5 Hasanpor, 2369, Arjai hiVaisoner awoke in the Cloak of
Azure Gems clanhouse to the excited chatter of persons in the hallway.
He stuck his head out the door, and caught the attention of a passing
clansman.

"Lord, ah, Takan, isn't it?  What is the commotion?"

"Great doings, Lord Arjai!  A procession is arriving at Payel's Wall!"

"Then it's beginning!  Come, escort us to a place of good viewing:
I will rouse my wife."  Lord Arjai turned, hair mussed and dressed only
in a sleeping-kilt, to find Lady Chitlasha dressed, groomed and ready 
for the excursion.

"Ah, good, you're ready!" he exclaimed.  He swiped his hand quickly through
his unruly locks, threw on a hmelu-wool kilt embroidered with symbols of
clan and temple, pulled on a matching vest, and donned his sandals.

By the time he was ready Takan and Chitlasha were already in the courtyard.
No palanquins were in evidence, having apparently been commandeered by the
early-risers in the clanhouse, so putting propriety aside the three joined
the streaming throngs which headed south through Bey Su to Payel's Wall.

Upon arrival, Lady Chitlasha's status and demeanor sliced an easy path
through the crowd to the crenellated southern edge atop Payel's Wall.
Only a single black Pe Choi blocked their view, apparently oblivious to
Lady Chitlasha's burning glare.

"Greeticks, my laty!" he clicked, and then turned, "it hats bit a lok time
sits I sensed you near."

"Lord Mt'tk!" she beamed, taking an upper hand familiarly, "why it's been
years!"

"Come," he gestured outward, "I have setcuret a prime vatatge point!"

Lord Arjai introduced Lord Takan, and then the four turned their attention
the procession which was even now approaching.

The column was led by a procession of green-armored warriors.  "The crossbow
legion of the Emerald Kirtle?" posed Arjai, but no one responded, too 
engrossed in the approaching palanquin.  Borne by dozens of thick-armed 
slaves, it was pyramidal in structure and several paces square on each side.
Atop the pyramid rode a woman, shrouded in an enveloping green veil.

"Not Princess Ma'in?" began Takan, trailing away.  It was certainly not she.
In the retinue of this unknown Dlamelish candidate were the Lady Elulen,
a high priestess of the Goddess, escorted by a familiar figure.  Chitlasha
made a gesture and held a hand before her face.  "It is Lord Sunchan,
the Copraphage of Jakalla -- he has come up in the world, escorting Elulen!"

Next came ranked lines of black and white warriors, a legion of Pe Choi, 
followed by a waddling legion of greenish-grey Pachi Lei.  These bore heavy
casks which they tapped occasionally, hammering spigots into the sides and
aiming the spraying ale into the outstretched mugs and skins of the crowd.
Lord Arjai caught the attention of a member of the Clan of Delightful Repast
who traded him several skins of fruit juice for an exorbitant sum.

Next came a palanquin draped in indigo and azure, with silver trim.
Lord Taksuru Tlakotani, seated upon a golden throne surrounded by a silver
balustrade, held his hands up before the adulation of the crowd.  From his
palms a shining silver light overcame the bright morning sunlight to 
illuminate the faces of the populace with his blessing.

"I lunched with him in the clanhouse here before he was revealed!" blurted
Lord Arjai, "Who knew, who could have thought that he was an Imperial Heir?"
Lady Chitlasha fixed her husband with an amused and tolerant glance which
might, or might not, have meant "I did," and then turned back to the view.

The booming kettle drums of the Legion of Red Devastation came next, along
with the Legions of the Storm of Fire, and Searing Flame.  On carts behind
these legions were piles of the heads of their defeated foes, before which
marched the legendary Karim Missum, showing no signs of the injuries which
nearly felled him in the Taking of Avanthar.

In a roaring voice Missum announced the arrival of "The God Himself, the
Emperor Mirusiya Tlakotani!"  The crowd roared its approval, although Prince
Mirusiya was not yet, officially, more than the Emperor pro-tem until the
High Council of the Priesthoods could complete their rituals.

Upon a mighty burnt-orange palanquin stood Prince Mirusiya himself, and now
the roar of the crowd rose like a great beast to its feet.  The very air
shook with the noise, and many clapped their hands to their ears for a moment
in surprise before joining in the cry.  Servitors scattered gold and silver
coins into the crowd, and rubies and other gems.  The powerful figure of
Prince Mirusiya stood nobly gazing forward, seemingly oblivious to the 
commotion, gazing only ahead into his city.

When his retinue had passed through the gates, then came the white 
palanquin of Prince Rereshqala and his wife, Lady Sogai.  "There she is,"
murmured Chitlasha.  "I did something right, didn't I?" grinned Arjai,
"Getting the two of them together."  Again Chitlasha favored him with
a tolerant smile.

The blue and white legions of Serqu, Sword of the Empire followed next, along
with the smaller palanquins of further, anonymous Imperial Heirs.  For now
was the endgame in their hidden upbringing, now was when the Temples would
play their final pieces on the den-den board, turning over black pieces to
reveal more powerful colors.  It was unlikely that these candidates would
be able to wield any real power, or wrest any political support from their
half-brothers who had for so long exercised their privileges.  Still, the 
life of a former Imperial Heir was one of comfort, if the right alliances
were struck, the right deals agreed to.  And so they came to Bey Su, a young
girl in the colors of the Temple of Dilinala, a shrouded figure in Hru'u's
dark purple, and others as well.

Finally came the Mringukoi and the Hehellukoi, the High Nobility of the
Empire, in attendance only because of their ancient and noble lineages.
By this time much of the crowd had departed for the Temples of the various
Candidates and Heirs, where the feasting which would last many days was
beginning.

This was a strange time in Bey Su:  after so many years of siege, privation
and warfare, the Intercalary Days had begun with the heady announcement of
Prince Dhich'une's defeat in the Golden Tower and days of riotous celebration.
Now, only five days later, the celebrations began anew as the Kolumejalim was
begun.  

In their clanhouse the next morning Lady Chitlasha and Lord Arjai received
word that their friend, Lady Sogai, had requested their company for breakfast
at the Governor's Palace, which had been turned over for the comfort of Lord
Rereshqala while he visited.  After bathing and donning the appropriate form
for a festive evening, the palanquin arrived at the Palace and they were
greeted by their companion.  A great feast was underway, with guests of 
many high stations, but Lady Sogai spent some moments filling in Lady 
Chitlasha on the changes that had transpired while they were away.  

Prince Eselne was dead of a wasting illness, this they had heard, and
both Princesses Aremala and Ma'in had renounced the Gold -- the former to 
pursue her artistic endeavors, and the latter upon the collapse of all
her schemes and plans for power.  It was clear following Ma'in's abortive
attempt to seize power in Jakalla that none of her half-brothers and would
be interested in allying with her upon the Petal Throne.

The new candidates had largely followed the guidance of their mentors
and chaperones and expressed their intention not to oppose Mirusiya
for the throne, for to do so would mean only certain death for them
in the contests of the Kolumejalim.  And Lady Sogai assured them that
the longstanding rumors of Prince Rereshqala's disinterest in the Gold
were most likely true, although they did not discuss such things directly.

Finally Lady Sogai drifted away to greet other guests, only to be replaced
shortly thereafter by the resplendent figure of Lord Osumetlu, who had
taken his place in the High Chancery here in Bey Su.  After affectionate
greetings, Lord Osumetlu offered his apologies.  "I must proceed to
Lord Aknallu's side with all haste, for the rituals begin shortly.
If you wish to observe the activities, I suggest you proceed hence as well,
for my power and influence can save a place for you within the hall for only
so much time!"

Lord Osumetlu hurried away, and Chitlasha rose, as well.  "It's time," she
said.

[Moderator's Note:  Bob provides us with Arjai's report (Part 2).          ]

From their vantage point in the balcony of the immense square chamber
of the High Chancery, Lord Arjai and Lady Chitlasha had a good view of
the Imperial Dais below, which was topped with the great golden seal of
the Empire.

Meeting, greeting and conversing with old friends and bitter enemies in
a convivial fashion, the mightest persons of the Empire were gathered to
observe the beginning of the rituals of the Kolumejalim.  Few would stay
for all the rites, which were lengthy and took several days, but none who
could attend would risk their chance to be present at the historic
presentation
of the candidates.

A hush fell over the murmuring crowd as ancient Lord Aknallu, the highest
of the members of the High Chancery, stepped forth to address the crowd.

"In the name of the Gods and in the Name of the Seal Emperor of Tsolyanu,
who sits forever in the Golden Tower of Avanthar, let us observe now the
Kolumejalim, the Rite of Choosing Emperors, as handed down to us through
tradition and ritual from the mouths of the Gods themselves, as revealed
by the Priest Pavar!"

Then did the hidden musicians and cantors undertake the grand music heard
only during the Kolumejalim, but for which they practiced every day of 
their lives for years.  From alcoves hidden behind stonework came songs
of glory and empire, nobility and faithfulness to the Gods of Tsolyanu.

While the songs rang out, the various candidates entered and took up
stations upon and around the great dais.  When the music was complete,
Korrikada hiKurrtashmu stood forth as the first speaker for his candidate
Prince Mirusiya.  He issued a brash and martial declaration, bestowing
credit for the salvation of the Empire upon his Prince with unreserved
grandeur.  Around them in the crowd, Arjai could see displeased looks
and whispered comments:  all knew that it was the union of the Princes
Taksuru, Rereshqala and Mirusiya which was finally victorious over the
former occupant of the Petal Throne.  Few wished to see that alliance
fractured, and such partisan claims as Lord Korrikada were making did
not contribute to the union.

Next stood forth Kettukal, formerly High General of the Empire, and
staunch ally of the departed Prince Eselne.  About him were arrayed
the finest surviving warriors of Eselne's army, who stood like gleaming
statues, moving not a muscle.  "We are here," barked the general, "We
are loyal in all ways to the Emperor.  All that is in the past is in the
past.  All that was between us is put aside.  The Army of the Empire
supports the Empire, the Army of the Empire is the sword of the Emperor!"

The crowd roared its approval of General Kettukal's grace and diplomacy,
which cast Korrikada's own brashness in stark relief.  In one simple yet
powerful statement, Kettukal had sealed the rift of civil strife between
the forces of Eselne and the other Princes.  No one present could doubt 
that at that moment Kettukal and all his men were ready to sacrifice their
lives at the behest of whoever was named Emperor of Tsolyanu.

Following Kettukal came a representative of the Temple of Belkhanu.
Their candidate was not present, he claimed, and Chitlasha and Arjai 
exchanged meaningful glances -- Lord Kirchta was, they knew, presiding
as Emperor in the Tsolyanu of an entirely different plane!  He went on
to speak in the uncharismatic fashion of his Temple of the establishment
of good government, and the building of order.  People began to stir
restlessly, and some at the back filed from the hall.  Sensing their
unease, Lord Aknallu called a halt to the day's proceedings, and all
retired to their palaces and temples for an evening of festivities.

The next day, the seventh of Hasanpor, the presentations began again.
First to speak was the representative of the Temple of Dlamelish, announcing
the renouncement of the gold on behalf of their candidate, young 
Princess Nareshana.  "She had an arrangement with the lad from Hru'u," 
whispered Chitlasha to her husband, "the two of them will renounce together
in exchange for certain favors granted by Prince Mirusiya."  

Next stood the representative of Prince Rereshqala.  "The words of the
mighty Prince are these," he declared, "That he shall, at last, renounce
the Gold, not in recognition of his own advancing years, but in truth out
of a deep love of his Empire, that it should not be divided again."  The
crowd murmured its approval, for this was expected, but also welcome.

In quick succession the representatives for Prince Surundano and Princess
Asudlana -- who was hitherto unknown -- renounced their claims.
Then stood forth a representative in the dark blue of the Temple of
Ksarul.  "Prince Mridobu," he began, and the crowd hushed.  The Prince
had been missing and assumed dead for over a year -- was he now to emerge
and stake his claim?  "Has no voice in these matters!" finished the 
representative.  The Prince, then, remained missing.

Prince Hehineshmu Tlakotani, of the Temple of Hru'u, stood himself to 
renounce his own claim.  A scruffy and unkempt youth, he seemed entirely
out of place among the high persons, and would likely follow timid
Prince Surundano of the Temple of Thumis into a life of obscurity within
his Temple.

A banner was then brought forth, dark red with the emblem of Prince
Eselne.  No words were spoken for the fallen Prince, and after a time
the banner was lowered and removed.

Following the presentation of Prince Eselne's banner, a representative
from the Temple of Dilinala announced that young Princess Ke'el
Tlakotani did renounce the Gold in favor of Mighty Prince Mirusiya.

Then Prince Taksuru himself stood forth.  It was expected that he would
renounce the Gold in exchange for the High Generalship of the Empire.
But it was not to be so.  "I stand for the Gold!" he cried, and a wave
of shocked exclamations swept the room, "As is my right and my duty
to the Empire."

The shock of this announcement had hardly sunk in, when a tall figure
in brown robes stood forth.  Beneath the copper skullcap was the craggy
face of Lord Jayargo.  This was unexpected, for he represented Prince
Dhich'une and was his very lieutenant in Avanthar.  None could believe
that he had made his way into this very hall, and all dreaded his
announcement.  Would he declare that Prince Dhich'une would stand for
the Gold?

"Mighty Lords and Ladies, I protest!" he cried, "Lord Aknallu, call off
this charade!  There is but one Emperor, and he is Eternal Splendor!
This undertaking is illegitimate and illegal, carried out in haste and
without notification!"

"Enough Lord Jayargo!" barked Aknallu, his voice powerful despite his 
years.  "This proceeding is more legitimate than that forced upon the
High Chancery by your master following the passing of mighty Emperor
Hirkane!  If this undertaking is illegitimate, let your master file
a grievance!  If it is meaningless, let your master ignore it!  But 
if he wishes to participate, let him arrive and do so!  Else," cried
Aknallu, relishing the irony of his declaration, "if he cannot arrive
in time to declare his candidacy for the Gold, he forfeits his claim
to the candidates who are present!"

His face purple with fury, Lord Jayargo stalked off the dais and
disappeared up an aisle.  Arjai watched closely, for he had been 
acquainted with Jayargo years before, when they sailed to Livyanu
together.  It did not surprise him that Jayargo's figure was 
never silhouetted in the doorway of departure, yet it was clear
to all that he had gone.

Finally Prince Mirusiya stood forth upon the dais, and all eyes turned
to him.

"I Mirusiya Tlakotani do claim the Gold, as is my right and is my 
duty to the Empire and to the Gods!  I am the Emperor of Tsolyanu,
my sword has been guided by the Gods, my feet are firm planted in
the Empire's soil, my arms have wrested open the door to the Golden
Tower!  I claim the Petal Throne as the son of Hirkane Tlakotani, 
The Stone Upon Which the Universe Rests!"

Despite themselves, some of the Prince's supporters roared their 
approval and beat the floor with their feet before being quieted 
by their comrades.  After this unseemly breech of protocol, an
unexpected event took place.

Prince Taksuru Tlakotani stood, and marched up to where Prince Mirusiya
still faced the crowd upon the dais.

"In the interests of the Empire, and on behalf of my brother, I hereby
renounce all claim to the Gold.  I do this to prevent further war, to
heal all divisions, and to honor the Petal Throne!"

As the crowd discarded with propriety and roared its approval, Lady
Chitlasha leaned over to whisper to her husband.  "Clever," she 
spoke in his ear, "very clever -- they presented a divided front to 
draw out Dhich'une, to see what he would do.  If he was going to

divided over the Gold.  Once Lord Jayargo played his meager hand,

the Princes once again closed ranks."

"That was indeed clever -- a strategem with the handiwork of our Prince
Taksuru upon it!" replied Arjai, "Did you know I once lunched with him
in our..."

But he was interrupted by the Prince, who had begun speaking again.

"We are brothers," declared Mirusiya, and he stepped forth to embrace
Prince Taksuru.  "We are builders!  We live together, we die together!
Avanthar is the capital of the Universe because we make it so!  We 
include a third!" and with this they turned to Prince Rereshqala, 
who nodded to acknowledge their attention.

"Three beautiful lights are in the sky over Bey Su!" cried Mirusiya,
"The Gods smile upon our Empire and upon the Emperor in the Golden 
Tower!  Go forth!  Celebrate!  Let the festivities not cease until
the Golden Door closes, and let them thereafter renew for many days!
I have claimed it, we have won it, the Empire of the Petal Throne!"

The roaring and cheering echoed throughout the audience chamber of
the High Chancery of the Priesthoods in Bey Su in a manner most 
unbecoming its dignity and grandeur.  But, for a while, even
stodgy Lord Aknallu grinned like the lad he once was.

As a footnote to the rebuilding of the Ise shrine - it takes place
approximately every twenty years, one of the reasons for which being that
if it's left for more than that, the artisans necessary for rebuilding it
are usually dead. The skills required can only really be passed on by
actually doing the rebuilding, making it hard to teach them to the next
generation if the rebuilding is too late.

Of course, the shrine at Ise is by no means an example of contemporary
Japanese architecture, but I expect the same thing could be said for many
of the temples of Tsolyanu - they aren't really 'normal' buildings, even on
Tekumel. Considering that Japanese culture has traditionally placed great
importance on the preservation of the status quo, just as Tsolyani society
does, the fact that they can't leave the rebuilding of the Ise shrine for
too long without forgetting how to do it properly would tend to indicate
that Ditlana would have to be done fairly regularly, or it couldn't be done
at all (at least not without a great deal of unnecessary time and trouble,
anyway).

Wonderful! You chaps who want to learn Tsolyani "as she is spoke" can now
go to the FTP site and dig in.

Theories about the great Maya cities have changed radically. When I began,
back in ther early 1940's, the reigning "Chief Scholar" taught that the
Maya were peaceful philosopher kings, who sat up in their tall temples and
observed the stars. No wars. They also were said to have used their
ceremonial cities largely for rituals and sacrifices, not for dwellings. I
remember one archaeologue at Tikal telling me that they had not found any
of the dwellings of the common people nearby, and he was thus puzzled. The
glyphs have now been partially deciphered, and we know that the Maya did
indeed have wars, rapine, pillage, and all the fun stuff that makes
European history so joyous... ;-) We also now know from intensive
investigations that each great city had smaller satellites around it, There
were thousands of common dwellings, too, but these have not survived the
rigors of the jungle and climate.

I suspect the post-cataclysm customs of the Latter Times did have a
residual memory effect upon the Tsolyani. It's likely.

Phil

[Moderator's Note:  Michael Schwartz and Charlie Goering ask questions dealing]
[                   with Chronologies and the recent History of Tekumel.      ]

Michael Schwartz writes...
Hey folks,

As I was browsing over various materials in preparation for my forthcoming 
campaign, I began mentally jotting down all the "current" dates which I 
discovered. The earliest is the default date listed in the "Swords & Glory" 
rules; second is the approximate year in which the events chronicled in 
"Man of Gold" unfold; third is the six-month span of time during which 
Trinesh and companions are AWOL in "Flamesong"; lastly, we know the dates
associated with Dhich'une's reign.

The Dates in Question
======================
"Swords & Glory": 2356 AS
"Man of Gold": 2358 AS
"Flamesong": 2361-2 AS
Accession: 2361 AS
Deposement: 2368 AS

I do not recall any specific dates indicated in the solitaire books or 
"Gardasiyal", although all certainly take place during the Dhich'une's 
reign. Might I ask if the Professor, Bob or another of our stalwart 
scholars of Tekumelani lore may have perhaps assembled a *modestly* 
detailed chronology of the twelve year period between "Swords & Glory" 
and the current date in Tsolyanu, one which encorporates and accounts 
for the events occurring in the "Adventures on Tekumel" series?

Charlie Goering writes...
I am somewhat confused with the timeline for recent years given in The Known
History (Rev.1) by Shawn Bond.

The entry for 2364AS begins with the death of Emperor Hirkane, followed by
East and West Front war news. The next item mentions Prince Eselne's death 
and revivification at Paya Gupa. 2364AS (early) speaks of the Mu'ugalavyani
invasion of the Chakas and then the entry for summer 2364-2365 tells of 
Eselne returning and breaking the seige of Paya Gupa.

Did Eselne leave the city after the assassination (if, to where) and then
return, or did the Lady Sitlaya strike after the Red Hats were driven back?
Also, about the heading "summer 2364-2365AS". Does this indicate a protracted
operation in breaking the seige, for example with a counter-seige against the
beseigers?

Further, the entry for 2366AS (autumn) shows Eselne leading troops toward Bey
Su and "bringing Hauma and Purdimal under hand". However, in 2376AS, he "takes
Mrelu and Purdimal". What halted the advance of 2366, and what was Purdimal's
status from 2366 to 2367?

Lastly, does General Kettukal still control the territory our departed-but-
greatly-mourned Prince held, or does he only control the immeadiate area of
Paya Gupa. 

Thank you for yoru attentaion and assisstence.

This is intensely interesting, Peter. It is also about 95% correct (i.e.
"real Tekumel" that I might have written myself). Do say hello to Muresh
for me; he may remember me from the Siege of Tleku Miriya. As I recall, 
he was one of the bravest fighters there.

Poor Muresh! He still wonders who paid the bribes to get him "exiled" to

Sticky mud and deadly plants -- and always the Hlutrgu all around. This was

Great see our local gaming being of interest.  I couldn't let you get away 
with the below comment in message 603:

[Moderators Note:  It was pointed out to me by another reader that the scale ]
[                  mentioned by Tom would mean that there were millions (if  ]
[                  not more) planets in pocket universes.  I would have to   ]
[                  defer to the Professor on the number of planets that dis- ]
[                  appeared during the Cataclysm.  I would think that this   ]
[                  would be more appropriate confined to a region of space   ]
[                  rather than the whole galaxy.   A humble opinion.         ]

The group here put their minds to it came up with a very simple solution - 
there may have been millions of planetary systems affected, but most were 
destroyed as a result of the shift? or what ever caused the pocket dimensions 
to form.  Thus leaving a limited number of functioning pocket dimensions - 
but why did these survive and the others get destroyed??  Seems strange that 
the surviving pocket dimensions (in our gaming system) all seem to have 
access to "magic"??

Just a contribution - never to be solved??

[Moderator's Note:  John Bailey offers the following snippet...             ]

Those of us with a general dislike of things un-alive were glad 
to hear of the sudden departure from the capital of the Pretender.  
It's too bad poor Eselne couldn't have lasted a bit longer to 
provide an interesting contest for the Gold.

Anyway, I had a vague premonition of the way things turned out.  
Last October, while working at a customer's site, I stepped outside 
the office and noticed a restaurant which made me think of all of you.  

The Red Flame Coffee Shop is located on 44th Street just east of 
Sixth Avenue.  The food is good and the prices incredible.  And 
I just kept thinking, wouldn't it be nice if . . .

Anyway, Merry Christmas and a blessed New Year to you all!! 
(does the Concordat hold between those of us not in Tsolyanu?)

To answer briefly: the three legions mentioned in your second paragraph are
now defunct, although one, the Legion of the Helm of Night, may still
possess a legion headquarters and a (bored and lonely) liaison officer. The
other two are, to my knowledge, gone. I suppose you could dig out their
histories if you can consult the great library in Avanthar. Bey Su's
library also has a set of historical legion histories that I have never had
time to study.

Translucent Emerald has no number as yet. Dhich'une put off giving it
official status, although it already had historical status. I am sure
Emperor Mirusiya (likely throne-name: "The Flame that Burns Eternal")  will
remedy this. Princess Ma'in wanted to keep this legion in Tumissa as her
private guard, but this won't happen. The legion will probably be sent down
from Tumissa into Pan Chaka to roust the Mu'ugalavyani invaders out of
there.

[Moderator's Note:  James Snead asks about the Disposer of Meku.             ]

>While all Tsolyanu is breathing a sigh of relief over the recent
>suspension of hostilities, I remain confused about a key event which
>precipitated the civil war, vis. the destruction of the temples of the
>Dark Trinity in Meku by the Disposer.  As I understand it, the Clan of the

>Wuru, also in that city?

The Disposer's full name is: Zu'ine hiVazhu. (accent of the "zu-" and upon
the "-zhu"). He is somewhat of a maverick: he is a fanatical Chiteng
worshipper, although many (not all!) of his clan favour Hru'u, Ksarul, or
their Cohorts. He was apparently just waiting for an opportunity to turn
the Sarku temple into hot ashes. Things got out of hand, and the Hru'u and
Ksarul temples (which stand nearby) went with it. Most of this has since
been repaired, although the Sarku temple is now closed -- Prince Mirusiya's
orders. The Disposer is youngish, about 48, thin, gaunt, and dark-visaged
with a spade beard. He is not known for his kindness but rather for his
occasional losses of temper, and the excesses he is then likely to commit.

He used his palace guard to start the rioting against the dark temples,
then paid the city guards, the tomb police, and other units with "loot" to
encourage them to join in. He's been carefully selecting these people for a
number of years, and they did just as he asked. The temple of Wuru is a
little farther down the street, and it was not touched, although it
remained under guard for a couple of weeks.

Rumour has it that the Disposer is on his way to Avanthar to pay respects
to the new Emperor. He had not yet arrived by last week, but a suite inside
the fortress is being cleared for him. Should be interesting. Mirusiya
doesn't particularly like him -- he's too single-mindedly fanatic to suit
the new Emperor!

My advice: do not cross this msn!

Lineage relationships are *almost* as good as being "family." Your two
characters will feel the same bond that brothers have, although less
strongly.

Many -- perhaps most -- lineages exist across clan boundaries, certainly
across class boundaries. There are "poor" Tlakotani, who farm the fertile
region just east of Bey Su. There are rich and successful members of other
clans, whose clan-brothers are rather poor. Only the highest of the high
and the lowest of the low do not seem to mix, as may be expected.

>My question is this -- what, if anything, does it mean to have the same
>lineage
>name as someone but be from different clans?

>"As a fellow Ketkolel, your actions reflect upon me.  I'll help you pay

This is a commonly expected reply from a lineage-brother/sister, provided
that the first person is not known to be a fool or profligate.

>"Ah, you're a Ketkolel too!  That makes us related!  What happiness!"

Another common response. This carries less enthusiasm.

>"Another Ketkolel?  Well, I can't marry your sister, even if we are from
>   different clans."

Possible. Usually clan marriages are made with equals or superiors (if one
is available). Hence, it is neither necessary nor surprising to find
someone who is already committed to a mate but has not yet married him/her.
This reply might be given to a semi-formal request to arrange a marriage.
THe answer given above is not a hostile one.

>"Ketkolel?  <shrug>  Well, at least I won't forget your lineage name."

Now you're starting to get rude and obnoxious. The addressee will respond
with a frosty smile and walk away.

Phil

After so much time has elapsed, there are very few real influences left.

Yes, head-binding occurs in certain groups in the far northeast (on the big
terrain map) and in Chayakku. It is unknown (today) in the Five Empires.

Yes, children tend to get "pet names" that are abandoned when the person
reaches adulthood. A good case is Qarras hiVriddi, the brother of Lady
Elara. He went quite made some years ago and ended wandering around Mrelu,
begging for a living. (The Imperial troops who occupied Fasiltum searched
for him but never did find him -- and now don't care.) Qarras' mother
nicknasmed him "Dazhu," which is the name of a sweet and aromatic little
pink flower that grows on the plain west of Bey Su. He still uses this name
and can't recall much of his time as "Qarras." Someone of stature (Arjai
hiVaisoner?) should ask Mirusiya to pardon him and have him cared for.
Perhaps Prince Rereshqala's gentle wife, Lady Sogai, could do it.

Mirusiya's troops are still searching the underworld below Avanthar for the
block of adamantine stone that putatively contains poor Elara hiVriddi
herself, frozen by a Ruby Eye. After having nearly been tricked by s
Sarku-sent demon (who pretended to be Elara), the Prince is understandably
cautious about new "Elaras." I think he still cares, however.

I'm not a Maya expert, but I can tell you that many skulls have been recovered
which show the same artificial cranial distortion depicted on vases and in
codexes (codices?).  The Maya area is not kind to human remains, but these
skulls can be put back together by experts, and the distortion is
unquestionably present.  I have witnessed it myself; my parents are physical
anthropologists specializing in the Maya.  (Heck, I've cleaned and numbered
skull fragments and occasionally even gotten to glue stuff...)

If you want a picture, I can get them to let me scan one and post it.

[Moderator's Note:  Patrick Brady offers more on the Ditlana/Sakbe thread.  ]

I'm terribly behind on reading the mailing list, but I would like to 
say two things relating to the Ditlana/Sakbe thread.

re: Ditlana. We tend to concentrate on Ditlana as a cultural oddity, 
as something which has to be explained by psychology and history, 
but it may be that there is a strong functional element to it. The 
cities of Tekumel are extremely old as continuously inhabited urban 
areas when compared to cities on Earth. The great cities on Earth have 
been either fairly young as true cities and/or have regularly suffered 
destruction by fire, warfare or urban redevelopment programmes.
If you live in London, as I do, the problems of maintaining the 
physical structure of a city after a few centuries becomes very 
obvious. Repair becomes increasingly inefficient. In London, new drains 
are difficult to site because you have to delicately remove miles of 
decrepid old stone drains and road repairs can be delayed for months 
while "who owns what" along a route is investigated. A city is like a 
house, after a few centuries the foundations will shift slightly and 
the walls will buckle and there will come a point when repairing it in 
small sections is actually more expensive than tearing it down and 
building a new one.  It is (in my opinion) plausible that after 500 
years or so the infrastructure of a city may be so degraded, with patch 
on top of repair,  that it is beyond the point where it can efficiently 
repaired any further and major restoration (Ditlana) becomes neccesary. 
If you think of Jakalla as a 500yr old house built on a good site, if you 
think about drains and roads rather than cultural imperatives, then I 
think it can be explained to any reasonable player. Maybe the Tsolyani 
are not being extravagant at all, it may be cheaper to Ditlana in the 
long run than to have your cellar flooded every rainy season and the 
road subsiding outside your door. One thing the Clan system does is to 
allow for long term planning. 

(2) Sakbe roads. I was brought up next to Hadrians Wall, which I 
think is as close as you'll get to a Sakbe in Eurasia. What I wanted 
to point out is that a "sakbe" that ran from one side of England to 
another didn't take the romans very long to build even though the 
conditions are notably harsh in places. The structure itself has been 
extremely durable, basically holding well for centuries. The main 
damage to the wall was actually done intentionally by locals who used 
it as a source of building stone for their farms. General opinion 
seems to have been that most of the 20ft high wall could have survived 
intact for a thousand years after the last engineers departed. So Sakbe 
may be relatively good designs which only require maintenance at very 
long intervals. If the Romans could do it, why expect anything less 
from the Tsolyani ?   

best wishes,
Patrick

[Moderator's Note:  Paul Snow writes in response to the Kolumejalim notes.  ]


Recently I found a note written, some time ago, by my Tsolyani friend Nikun hi
Sayodla which simply said,

        Find out about the Marek.

Unfortunately I have been rather too busy to follow his request but today after
reading the following passage,

>"I lunched with him in the clanhouse here before he was revealed!" blurted
>Lord Arjai, "Who knew, who could have thought that he was an Imperial Heir?"
>Lady Chitlasha fixed her husband with an amused and tolerant glance which
>might, or might not, have meant "I did," and then turned back to the view.

I found another note which says,

Now is the time.

So, can Phil or anybody help Nikun and me? I hope Nikun's little schemes don't 
get us into too much trouble.

Best wishes,

While rereading my copy of Empire of the Petal Throne, I stopped after I 
read some of the creature descriptions. Would players know about how to 
deal with certain kinds of creatures. Mrur, for instance, must have their 
bodies burned after they are defeated in combat. Would a player know that? 
A priest of Ksarul or Sarku might know that, but what about a warrior who 
worships Karakan? I know all of this stuff is up to my discretion when 
running a game, and an NPC hireling might be able to help out the players 
with information like that provided the information was well compensated 
for. I guess the question is how much about the world should beginning 
characters know? If rules or conversion rules are used to create "Real" 
Tekumel characters, then I suppose a certain ammount of information would 
all ready be in the hands of characters, depending on their background. 
Empire of the Petal Throne characters might not have this information, as 
they are assumed to be foreigners from smaller countries, or travelling 
nonhumans. Not that a Shen is to likely to worry about whether or not a 
bunch of Mrur is going to get back up and slug out with him in two 
rounds.... Just some wonderings about the balancing act referees must 
contend with.

When Engsvan hla Ganga sank, Penom was apparently higher and drier than it
is now. This is true all along the southern coast -- cf. the Fortress of
Ngala in the swamps opposite Jakalla. I don't know *how much* higher and
drier -- accounts differ -- but enough so that in some places there were
houses and fields and even towns. When Ganga sank, the great tektonic plate
to the north seems to have sunk somewhat with it, inundating the Swamps of
Tsechelnu and parts of the plain northeast of Jakalla (since dried up and
now excellent arable land again).

Penom has been singled out as a hell-hole for diseases and bugs since
Bednalljan times, in spite of its being a little higher and drier, as noted
in the preceding paragraph.

There is a species of bee mentioned in the Bestiary. There are many other,

there are also little birds, like humming birds, that pollinate the
vegetation.

The usual mortal insult is based on the clan status of the insultee. To say
that someone is "Nakome" (clanless) is about as bad as you can get.
Membership in low clans, those that clean out toilets and dredge sewers,
are also excellent sources for rude and disgusting comments: e.g. the Black
Mat clan. When people from this clan are nearby, most Tsolyani turn away
and affect to hold their noses! This gesture alone can indicate this, and
it is often used as a "silent" insult. On a higher level, "lack of noble
action" makes for a good meaty insult: e.g. to a Vimuhla worshipper, you
might try saying, "You flout your little fat bum like an Avanthe virgin!"
Or to a Ksarul worshipper: "You spew 'knowledge' like a Thumis priest!"

Tsolyani use deferential pronouns and honorific verb forms more than I can
indicate in English. In our games we have had to cut out the fulsome
compliments, noble allusions, and flattering metaphors. Once in awhile I
may say to a player, "That isn't how a Tsolyani would say that -- or think
it. You can't go around insulting your comrades just because it is funny in
American society!"

This is a tough one because practice differs from preaching, and individual
responses vary widely. There *is* indeed more connection between the
temples of a God with his/her Cohort than with other deities. Trading
favours is always useful, as is simple cash bribery. If it gets you killed
by an irate temple priest, then you will have brought this on yourself.

This is too large a subject to be tackled in one posting. The theory is
that "ghosts" are interplanar emanations from particularly strong or
emotion-driven minds: the Shadow-Self of a murdered man, or of someone who
so dearly loves a living person that he/she cannot leave him/her, the mind
overflowing with hatred or a desire for revenge -- all are supposed to be
good sources for ghosts. There is no supernatural connection, according to
most temples (and particularly that of Lord Belkhanu, who knows about these
things); it is "other-planar" energy seeping through between the Planes.

Usually the temples teach that ghosts are other-planar emanations of the
Shadow-self -- not combinations of  other parts. There are other theories,
of course, and over the millennia there have been minor religions that
based all of their contact with the "Spirit World" on "ghost-speech":
communication of the priest's Shadow-self with one from another Plane.

You remembered it correctly. That gesture is mostly used in Jakalla and
upriver to Bey Su. It is unknown in Fasiltum, Sokatis, and the east, while
in the west (Tumissa, Paya Gupa, etc.) it is sometimes used and sometimes
replaced by another gesture: the left hand is held out, palm down, at about
chest height. The gesturer then moves the hand back and forth in the air a
few times, signifying "nothing" = "*you/he/she/etc. is/are nothing!"

The summoning gesture is as you describe: palm down. One then curls one
finger or all four under the palm several times. Sometimes people snap
their fingers to attract a slave's attention. Do not try this on your wife.

The insult gesture uses the same palm down feature to symbolise "negative,
low-class, ugnoble," but the gesture is different: the whole hand is held
out rather stiffly and waved horizontally from side to side (usually with
verbal insults, etc.). This same general idea is found in the
gesture-language of various Terran societies.

If Nikun *knows* someone who *may* be a Marek, the best thing is to stay
away from the problem. Marek have been known to defend their secrecy and
hidden roles in society very handily. Try talking to Iena, Lord Arumel's
pretty and very wilful wife, and you may end up as fuel for one of her

What are the better known planes of existance that Tekumelian travellers
are prone to end up in ?  Scanning trough old Blue Room messages i found
one about the "Buffalo" plane, but that was it.


Also, can you tell me if there are any new developments on the Prof.
fabled third novel "The lords of Tsamra" ?  Can we hope for it to be
released soon ?

Are there currently any plans to publish a collection of essays

Failing that, is there any information published on Hekellu or Vra that
it would be possible to purchase or download?

Given that the question's being directly asked, I feel that courtesy demands
that I break silence.

I'm writing a City Guide to Jakalla.  It's going a lot slower than I had hoped
(minor issues like finishing law school can interfere), but when finished it
will have a fair amount of never-before-published information from the
Professor in it.  I also hope to include a Jakalla solo adventure, in the
spirit of the AoT books.

There is some information on the Hokun in the "Tekumel Bestiary." It is not
very much, but it does give enough to deal with wandering parties of Hokun
met while adventuring. A complete description of Hokun society is very hrd
to imagine; it would be quite large, with varied nation-states and
interactions with human neighbours.

>I would like a little information the Hokun, so far i only know they are

No. They're from one of the star systems that were just beginning to
exchange delegations with Humanspace when the Time of Darkness came.

>Do they posess any multi-planar abilities like the Mihalli or
>the Chima ? What about technology.

Not very much interplanar skill -- far less than the Mihalli. They're about
on a par with the Chima. They have maintained a little technology but not
much, and not very consistent, Mostly they use items scavenged from the
ruined cities on the far side of Tekumel. I hope some of the Thursday Night
people will speak up here.

This is a *very* hard question since nexus points are often "pointed"
towards specific Planes or complexes of Planes. One nexus point may open
into only one Plane, or it may open into a black velvet void where human
senses perceive routes to many Planes as a sort of staircase hanging in
black otherness. The steps look like ivory plaques, and they are attached
to nothing at all -- very unnerving. These staircases wander, branch out,
and even turn upside down so that a traveller farther ahead may appear as
walking on the underside of a staircase and hanging head down in
nothingness!

Alas, I haven't done much with it lately. Wish I could...

The average Tsolyani urban dweller knows more about flora and fauna,
perhaps, than many of his Terran counterparts. His life is much more "back
to nature" than that of a citizen of a large European/American city. The
Tekumelani are closer to their ecology than Terrans might be. Every
Tekumelani knows about Hmelu and Hma and Chlen-beasts. As long as an animal
or plant occurs in the local environment, it will be familiar and known to
all but a very few. One thus knows enough to avoid an Alash snake, or
certain of the uglier insects of Penom. I would say that the average
person, thus, is able to function as well as a Terran in similar
circumstances, although the flora and fauna of a new and different region
might initially be unfamiliar and require guidance from a local. For
example, a Tsolyani travelling to Shenyu would have to learn to avoid the
Shen delicacy, the Chr-melon. Just as you might rely upon a local or an
exerpienced fellow-countryman here, so it is the same there. It is the same
for a European who is introduced to that stinking but tasty fruit grown in
Indonesia-Malaysia (I've forgotten its name), or somebody who tries to eat
Manioc without processing all the potassium cyanide out of it! A month or
two in a new place, and you learn enough of the ropes to survive.

This is a somewhat different issue. Does a person know about Mrur? About
Kayi, Hra, and other critters of the Underworlds? About fish and sea-life
-- what's edible, and what are *you* likely to be edible to? About caves
and their dangers? About climbing a mountain? One assumes that the person
has not grown up in a vacuum. The temple schools teach about many of these
things: not the inner doctrines or the nitty-gritty of the fauna of so
faraway place, perhaps, but all that local citizens need to know. Stories
and anecdotes circulate on Tekumel, just as they do here. Everybody has
heard that Tsural buds will drive off a Thunru'u, even though some folk
have never seen either one. The legends (many untrue) about Mrur, Shedra,
and Jajgi are too numerous to recount here, and the feeding habits of the
mighty Sro are discussed in the playgrounds of the temple academies of Bey
Su. Burning an Undead to keep it from regenerating is pretty common
knowledge: many students have heard of this, while peasants have some
likelihood of knowing it.

Referees, in my experience, often have a different problem: the players
know *too* much. They know, for example, which chemicals must be combined
to make gunpowder. They know they can hide underwater and breathe through
reeds. They recognise a spaceship or tubeway car and automatically know
what knobs and dials do.

So what does one do? Give each person a background and then devise dice
rolls when an item of information is needed. This *has* to be fairly
arbitrary. Does a boy raised in a palace in Bey Su know much about Zrne? He
has no skill in zoology or animal training, let's say, and thus can only
have heard the tales and rumours of this terrible beast in school. He will
have seen the word "Zrne" in school texts, perhaps, but he won't know much
more than that. It is probable that he will have heard more stories about
Mrur. If his family follows Lords Sarku or Durritlamish, he will likely
have heard a lot about Undead, and may even have met a few at various
ceremonies in the temple. A graduate of the  Sarku-temple school will have
heard about Jajgi, too, but this is a bit higher than most "common folk" go.

The dice roll for a person to know about a given animal, plant, etc. must
thus be adjusted: say, 01-85 for an urban Tsolyani to know about Hmelu,
Hma, etc.; 01-70 for him to have read about Zrne; 01-30 for him to have
heard that Tsural buds repel the Thunru'u; 01-20 for him to know something
(some fact and some fiction) about Jajgi and the creatures of the lower
Underworlds; 01-20 for him to know what a tubeway car is; and perhaps 01-05
for him to be able to insert one of the golden "destination discs" into the
tubeway car's console. This all assumes that the person does not have a
logical background that will automatically provide these facts (i.e. he/she
is not a Tsural-bud grower). A traveller from Livyanu may not know even the
commonest Tsolyani fruit (Mash), but in his own homeland he'll know just
about everything in his environment. A peasant would have more knowledge of
Chlen, Hma, and Hmelu -- including hands-on experience -- than a spoiled
noble lad from Bey Su.

One should perhaps handle this arbitrarily: look at the person's
character-history; add in the levels of schooling he/she has had, figure
out which items would be familiar and which would be alien; then set up a
dice roll and go to it. Each character might thus get one (and only one)
roll to comprehend a new creature or artefact, modified by the factors jsut
mentioned.

The temples do teach about many items not in one's immediate environment,
and many libraries contain manuscript copies of comon texts on zoology,
geography, and animal husbandry. There are travellers' accounts, too, and
compendia of the wildly incorrect stories told by guides and tourists (cf.
Herodotus on our own planet). Somebody who had read one of the latter might
thus believe in the Flying Golden Zrne that is said to dwell on an island
in the southern seas, or the Mud People of the Tale of Narkodlan -- both
apparently quite without basis in reality.

That's about the best I can do with this constantly knotty problem.

Phil

The circle with thumb and forefinger is a bad one in many Terran 
cultures as well.  I seem to recall that this (essentially the 
American 'OK' sign) signifies 'you are an asshole' to many Latin 
cultures and the Mediterranean  and South America.  This should also 
be a reminder to world travellers to be very careful of any hand 
gestures when travelling in foreign lands.  You might get yourself 
beat up.  Last week's 'Savvy Traveller' radio program on NPR 
mentioned this.  A woman living in Brazil was having a piano lifted 
into her apartment.  After the workmen hard long and hard pulling on 
the ropes, she leaned out and gave them the OK sign.  They were very 
insulted and she had to find out what she had done and then 
apologized profusely.  They couldn't understand why she would insult 
them after working so hard to help her.

[                   great!  Thanks for keeping us informed, Bob.         ]

The pre-publication reading copies are SOLD OUT.  One copy, destined for
Nicky Lane in Virginia, is in the mail.  Two copies have been held for
persons intending to send orders immediately.  No further copies can be sold.

If you are not one of the three people listed above, and you have ordered
Mitlanyal and not received it, please let me know immediately.  If your
check has cleared and you have not received your copy of Mitlanyal, please
let me know immediately, as your copy is likely lost or delayed in the mail.

Otherwise... you'll have to wait for TOME!

Regarding TOME, two bits of news:  TOME has returned to the plan of
publishing Mitlanyal in one volume.  Additionally (and I might add much to
my surprise) they have requested additional content in the form of
character sketches for each remaining chapter.  So there will be one small
reason for those persons holding the reading copies to purchase the final
volume when it is published.

[Moderator's Note:  Professor Barker answers a question from Rick Sauter ]
[                   about the current boundaries of the Five Empires.    ]

>Many thanks,

The boundaries of Tsolyanu have been somewhat fluid during the past several
years. THe Mu'ugalavyani have taken Pan Chaka but are apparently about to
give it up in the face of the new Emperor's vigilance. Do Chaka is much as
it has been for a long time: Tsolyani rule but with enclaves of "wild" Pe
Choi occupying the hinterlands. The border with Yan Kor is now vague and
constantly changing. Eastern Milumanaya has practically become part of
Tsolyanu, with a powerful Imperial governor in Sunraya. The east has not
changed too much: the Salarvyani have retreated out of Kaija (they couldn't
stand the Hlutrgu either) and Kerunan and are nervously watching Bey Su for
signs of a renewed interest in Mmillaka and the Gilraya Forests. The little
town of Ru is still part of  the Prefecture of Koyluga, but Emperor
Mirusiya has indicated to the Salarvyani in Tsatsayagga that they must give
it up. He's giving them a few months to turn over the government there
quietly; otherwise comes the deluge!

All of the above, depending upon the circumstances. In the first place, it
would be hard to imagine a new deity who could not be fitted into the
Aspect system somewhere. His followers, being Tsolyani, would already have
this system strongly ingrained and would tend to make him an Aspect of
somebody.

When the British brought Christianity to India, they found that the Hindu
priests were quite willing to make Jesus an "Avatar" of Vishnu, the God of
permanence, continuity, and cyclical change. The missionaries reacted
strongly and managed to keep Jesus out of the Hindu pantheon only by
stubborn denial. The same thing had almost happened to Muslim Allah 600-700
years before, but the Islamic insistence on *one* and *only one* God made
it impossible to put Allah (or His Prophet, Muhammad) into the pantheon.
The Hindus had no trouble including certain kings (e.g. Tiruvallu Naik of
Madurai), other prophets and great people (e.g. Mohandas K. Gandhi), but
they couldn't get either Christians or the Muslims to accept roles as
member-gods of a large group!

On Tekumel, it would be likely that this "messenger" would find himself
preaching to only a few people since the "gods" are demonstrably real,
material, and immanent. The "new religion" cannot match the miracle plays
and demonstrations of "magic" that any average priest can drum up.
Traditions are strong, too, and it is easier to fit in as a gifted preacher
or "reviver" of older values than it is to start something new.

If the new preacher did get a foothold, by some means, the priesthoods
would quietly cut off his funds, convert his followers back to the fold
with bribes or threats, keep him from setting up temples (zoning laws?),
and generally discourage him legally. Sentencing him to death is an option
that probably need not be tried, unless he committed a real legal crime
somewhere.

Another and common solution is laughter: jeer at him and prove he is
"insane" and should be cared for by his clan and original temple. Ridicule
works about as often as capital punishment. Only if he really started to
gain power would he be "offed."

[                   on Tsolyani coinage.                                     ]

I recall there was an article on Tekumelani coinage published in the old
Tekumel Journal. I can't lay my hands on my copy right now. Perhaps someone
else can help? Chris, if you have a copy of the coinage article, you might
just quote the section on Tsolyani currency. Thanks!

[Moderator's Note:  I'll check into it.                                      ]

The Kaitar is a small gold coin, usually with a much-simplified image of the
Imperial Seal on one side, and the throne-name and a date (in Tsolyani
numerals) on the other. Some previous Emperors have tried adding mottoes
(like "In God we trust"), and a very few have put their protraits on the
coins they issued. This hasn't happened in recent reigns. The coin is just
too small for great portraiture!
