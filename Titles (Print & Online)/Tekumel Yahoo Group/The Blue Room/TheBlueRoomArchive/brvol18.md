These messages are the accumulation of the messages that were sent out on 
the Blue Room email list between May 1995 and June 2000.  A large portion 
of the information is directly from Professor M.A.R Barker. When the list 
members joined during the time the list was active, they agreed to refrain 
from sharing this data with non list members.  When the list ended, it was 
urged that the data be made available to non-list Tekumel fans, and it 
seemed like a good idea all around.

I only ask that if you download these digests, or have received them in 
some other way, please respect the agreements the list members made, and 
refrain from passing them around and instead point people to the Tekumel

>From here out, the > prefaced lines are Bob's response.  The other lines
are Professor Barker's comments.

>Here is my response, but I'd like to hear what the professor has to say.
>It is important to understand that in Tsolyani terms I am a "scholar priest,"
>likely of Thumis, probably only of the second circle.  Hence military matters
>hold almost no interest for me whatsoever, unlike many gamers.  Thus my

>
>As far as I know, the military in Tsolyanu is a uniquely hybrid beast:  the
>military legions are wielded by the Imperium, but are supported and funded
>by various combinations of the Temples, clans, and the local and imperial
>treasuries.
>
>This balance prevents the military as a whole from gaining too much
>independent power, and also prevents any of the Imperium, Temples and
>clans from turning the military against any of the other groups.

There is also the ancient, historical prestige factor: these Legions have
histories and Kaing (= standards) that date back hundreds and in some cases
thousands of years. Generals dare not allow their personal greed to
besmirch a reputation that was old when Engsvan hla Ganga ruled the world!
The Tsolyani Imperium is indeed a unique sort of quasi-religious,
quasi-economic, quasi-political creation. It is part of a temple's glory to
be one of the patrons of its legions, and it is similarly part of a clan's
pride to be a patron of those legions. The temples and the clans view to
establish "museums" (halls of memory, as some call them), in which the
ancient war relics are set out for all to see: great Kaing standards, the
older ones encased in protective lead sheaths; swords, shields, tabards,
armour, bows and other weapons, captured enemy gear, treasures and trinkets
of campaigns fought long ago. These things are just another part of the
glue that holds Tsolyani society together.

>But the military stands alone.  (Now this is where I get hazy.)
>Anyone can join any military legion, with some exceptions.  In some cases
>the restrictions that exist are unwritten, such as a Sarku-worshipper
>joining Red Devastation.  In other cases the restrictions are explicit:
>no men will join Lady Dilinala's legion of lesbian warriors.  However,
>one is generally free to join almost any legion.

This is true, with the reservations mentioned above, plus unwritten
economic/social stringencies as well: a poor lad cannot join Red
Devastation, any more than a poor girl can join Lady Mrissa's legion of
women. A good clan membership can get you in, but if you lack such support,
you may not be able to join the legion of your choice. You can then join a
lesser legion, or you can join a temple priestly guard legion (if you're
devout enough and of the right clan), or you may join a city guard or Sakbe
road legion -- or you can can get into one of the supply units that provide
food, goods, weapons, clothing, transport, and other logistic needs.

>If a young man or woman wishes to join a legion supported by Lord Karakan,
>he or she may do so.  Even (hazy again) a youth whose family raised him as
>a Sarku worshipper could join, although he would be well advised not to
>exhibit any but the most perfunctory interest in his family faith.

As stated above, this is theoretically possible but practically dubious in
many cases. A backsliding Sarku worshipper might be given a chance if he
has money, friends in the right places, and perhaps other reasons to be
admitted. Case in point: Prince Rereshqala recently had to intervene in a
case in which a young worshipper of Hru'u was admitted into a highly placed
legion devoted to Lord Hnalla. When discovered, the legion's officers
proposed to quietly throw him out and be done with it, but the boy called
upon a powerful clan relative in Sokatis. During the investigation of how
this had happened, it turned out that the recruiting officer (a Molkar in
Jakalla) had allowed himself to be swayed by the fact that the boy's older
sister, a truly lovely maiden, would be made available to him if the lad
were admitted without question. This seems to have been carried out by the
machinations of the lad's clan, and the girl -- a rather meek young
clangirl -- had little to say about it. Prince Rereshqala untangled the
mess, put the boy into a good Hru'u-based legion, sent his soldiers to
rescue the girl from her unwilling liaison, and reprimanded those
responsible.

>One could be a worshipper of Lord Karakan, then, but not be a priest of the

All true.

>Priests of the various temples may become military officers through

>or by means of political and financial incentives.  High Administrative

All true, again.

A few exceptions exist, but in general this is true.

>The temple guard of the various temples are (always? usually? sometimes?)
>a branch of the ritual priesthood, of fairly junior station.

They are usually an *offshoot* of the ritual priesthood, but they are not
counted as technically belonging to it. Thus, the ritual priests of Karakan
might not consider their temple guards as organisationally part of
themselves. It is like asking an American marine if he/she is *part* of the
U.S. army, the Navy, the Airforce, or the Coastguard! In a broader sense,
yes; in a narrow sense, no. Temple guardsmen usually start as ritual
priests (but so do administrators and scholars), but they branch off and
become members of their special units rather quickly.

>The grizzled sergeant of the temple guard is probably someone of only
>moderate >clan, only moderate ambition, and only moderate intelligence and
>political >skills, Hence their rather unphenomenal station in life.

All true.

But the Temple Guard are
>either ritual priests, or else clanspeople hired by the Temple for the duty.

Temple guards normally begin as ritual priests but quickly specialise.
Local clansmen are not usually taken directly into a temple guard unit,
although they may be hired for special tasks (e.g. crowd control, guarding
a shipment of goods beinf sent from one temple to another, etc.).

Not for me to poke holes in your blanket! You express things nicely. All I
can add are a few details.

[                   Civil War in this age, too.  Who'd have guessed???     ]

My intro.  I have decided to mash my intro, and Al's 2 reports into one
message.  Others will follow as they arrive.
-------------------
I am Kanuthu Melesh, Second Magistrate of Seyritha, a small quiet town
in the Northern part of the Engsvanyali Empire.  My post was a quiet
one, without much prestige, but comfortable for a small town.  it all
started with an uproar one afternoon, when 4 clan-brothers from quite
some distance away blustered in complaining of brigands, and bearing 
large kegs of Zu'ur.  A most deadly drug.  After being told by the 
head of the local Alchemist's clan (I am still not certain I trusted
his opinion -- other than the one he offered about his clansman, the
fact that they were idiots!) that it was not Zu'ur, I stored the liquid
for further analysis.  We ate and I had the unpleasant task of trying
to decide how to tell them that Geroth (the "bandit") was actually a
clan-cousin doing some "covert operations".  :)  But there were other
things that needed to be discussed.

They brought very disturbing news.  Apparently a rising power in the 
North was threatening the peace.  We (our clan) supported the First
Prince of Engsvan hla Ganga.  The would be usurper of the North, the
Prince of Blood was trying to consolidate his power in the North, and
move down to meet the First Prince.

During the night, as we slept in my "palace" (it was a crumbling affair)
we were warned of imminent attack.  I was 2nd Magistrate, and we tried
to notify the 1st Magistrate, but it appeared the murdering rogues were
already in that part of the city.  We found all members of our clan had
been killed, along with one of Geroth's "daughters".  Geroth found us
(or did we find him?) outside the clanhouse and led us into an unfre-
quently used storehouse, that allowed us to move out of the area unseen.
With our "bandit" clan-cousin Geroth, we struck out to the wharves to 
find a boat in which to escape.  We discovered that one of the reasons 
the Prince of Blood was here was to raid our warehouses of food and 
other resources.

Well, we couldn't let that happen!  We torched most of the warehouses,
hopefully setting back the Prince's plans, and struck off to the North.
One of the last sights I saw of Seyritha was its burning wharves, and 
a jewel encrusted armoured figure shaking his fist at us, as we paddled
toward the Northern shore of the Lake.

We had picked up about 40 or so refugees, also, and had to bring them
with us.  We barely kept in front of the Prince's troops, and after 
many difficult days and nights we made it to a nice quiet village.

We were openly welcomed, and the refugees were invited to stay and help,
and have found a new home.  At least for now.  A few days later a con-
tingent of the Prince's men parlayed with my clan-brothers, and after 
some discussion, returned to the Prince, as their orders were somewhat 
confusing, (or my clan-brother confused him with Chlen-sh*t).  After
a few days, my clan-brothers struck further north, and I stayed with
the refugees, and am helping integrate them and myself into the new
village we have now made our home.

It is my hope to strike out after my clan-brothers, and rejoin them
after I have made sure what is left of the people of Seyritha that are
here remain safe and comfortable.  

I shall share their reports with you as I receive them.

Progress report 1
------------------------
To:  Kanuthu Melesh, Second Magistrate of Seyritha
From: Koroneshmu vi Endu

Dearest Cousin:

Once again I thank you for your kind hospitality and your aid in helping us
escape from Seyritha.  As you remember we parted your company in a small
village nestled in the mountains to the north of the city.  At that point
we left with Geroth, the onetime bandit, clan cousin and now guide and
confidant.  I am writing this letter to recount our adventures since
parting.

We left the village mentioned and traveled north over the peaks of the
mountains in the company of several dozen of the personages that wished to
accompany us in that direction.  Once we reached the top of the mountains,
we noticed that the forests to the east along the range were old growth
forests with few if any breaks.  Along to the west there were some fields.
The sea was readily visible from the top of the mountain.  Oh to explain
the wonders that we fealt seeing the desire of our hearts the first time!
Lo! We sang bawdy tavern songs, that would cause even the most seasoned of
our clan sisters to blush. La! We merrily marched down towards the sea.  We
could tell that the sea was shallow.  Persons could be seen walking out far
into the sea.  The crops along this side of the slope were in a good stage
of growth.  Chlen beasts were pulling loads in and out of the fields.

We saw a number of persons along the road and questioned them.  They
informed us that this area was under the control of the Prince of Blood. 
One boy of about fourteen was particularly informative.  He explained that
his village was ahead and we paid him a few small coins (I was amazed he
knew the value of money) to lead us to his village near the coast. 
Numerous children came up to us an begged.  The told us for a few coins
they could lead us to the pirates treasure and other places of interest. 
The children were no worse nor better than the beggars that line the street
outside of our clan house.  The older lad said he would take us to his
grandmother who could give us space for the night.

It was some time after sunset when we entered the village. It was poor.  It
is cut off from the seacoast and is in the middle of the forest.  One rush
light was lit in the village square.  A man was sitting in the village
square near the light.  We questioned him and he stated that the Lord of
Blood came and took the adults away from the village.  Now only the young
and the old live in the village. The crops are standing the fields and only
the older children are left to do the work.  We questioned the old man at
some length and he stated that the village had no real name other than "the
village".  He also knew that the path that led down the seacoast to a town
about 20 or 30 ssan away.  It was at this time that we noticed that the
peasants that followed us were no longer with the party and we could not
determine when they had left us.  Geroth did not wish to stay in town but
said that he would stay in a cove about two ssan down the road to the west 
The cove had lots of driftwood and was a ssan from the open sea.  An inlet
about a quarter ssan in width goes all the way to the village.  About four
ssan to the west was a pomentary that had a lookout post on it in the days
that this village was a pirate base.  Hakael was the name of the old man
that assisted us and directed us to the home of the old woman.

We went into the house and went up to the second story to spend the night. 
Later that night the children brought us food.  All did not seem right in
that the Grandmother was not around.  We looked at the food and decided
that one of us would eat and the others would not.  We lit the candle and
notice that shadows long and thick were forming everywhere.  The darkness
began to press around the light from the candle.  We went to sleep while
one kept watch.

It was during the second watch that we were attacked.  The children had
grown to the height of a man.  We could reconize there features although
they had hideously changed.  We smote them with our weapons only to find
that they had greyish smoke inside of them! No blood!  No entrails!  What
foul beasts of legend and the tombs had we disturbed.  There were others
outside of the room.  We relit the canlde.  Outside of our window we could
see drifting shadows and forms in the fog.  There could be heard soft
chittering in the wind.  The fog actually had tendrils that would reach out
and touch things.  We went outside briefly to look around.  We looked at
the house and it had changed form!  It now appeared to be the aft castle on
a ship and not like a house at all.  We went back into the house/ship and
back to our room.  The food that had appeared eatible earlier now appeared
fetid and decayed.

Soon we heard crying in the street.  A child was in the middle of the street
crouching and weeping.  The child began to mutter and we did not understand
what it was saying.  We approached the child only to find out it was not
human but some creature from a nightmare!  It had long limbs and a narrow
probisus.  It had grey powder that it sprayed out. When we struck the
creature is exploded in a cloud of smoke.  It sounded like shattering
bamboo.  We raced back to the house.  Once inside we noticed shadow
creatures along the walls and ceiling that attempted to drop upon us. 
Spidery types of creatures whose heads would change shape while watched. 
There were undead buried in boxes that came out to get at us. Other
creatures attemmpted to attack us that I can barely describe.  It is
strange in that I was touched by two of these creatures and I became
deathly cold from there touch.  I was moving as if in slow motion, as if I
was acting in a fog.  We defeated some of these creatures and it was soon
determined that we could not last the night.  We decided to strike out for
the cove with Geroth.

On the way to the cove, we almost succombed to the fog and creatures.  I
wished to sleep, but the others would not let me.  We foudn a statue in the
path, it was very worn.  It looked like a human being wearing a cloak, like
a priest or holy persons. What was of importance was that the fog could not
or did not come near the statue.  We decided we would have to spend the
rest of the night at this statue.  We placed our back to the statue and
looked out into the four directions.  Dawn came some time later.

---to be continued---

Progress Report 2
---------------------------------
When dawn finally came we were able to look a bit closer at the statue.
Although we could not read the script, I took a piece of parchment and took
what I believed to be a  carving of the name of the entity or personage
represented by the statue.  We went back to the town in the morning to
discover that in the daylight the town looked entirely deserted.  Not a
person was in sight and everything looked like it had not been used in a long
time.  We were perplexed in that the creatures here knew of Prince of Blood.
In that we were sure that they existed and we did not enter into some sort
of interdimensional rift or interfogulation as it is technically known by the
Priests of Hlallal. We spotted Geroth or he spotted us and we told him of our
adventure of the previous night.  He warded himself and advised we leave
immediately.  We decided not to burn the village.

As we approached the shore we noticed that there are carved wooden pillars
everywhere along the shore facing seaward.  Soon traveling along the coast we
meet some men from a village farther up the coast.  We ask them of the
pillars and they tell us that these pillars are used to keep demons and
ghosts from coming to their village.  We inspect the pillars further.  There
are strange marks and symbols upon them.  Some of these pillars appear to be
of stone.

Further along the coast we see a bay.  The water level is low at this time of
the day so we may cross without much difficulty. At night the water goes far
inland along this inlet. The village is much larger than the one we were in
last night.  There are white mud walls along the entire perimeter and halfway
up the hills leading to the mountains.  There is a substantial amount of
cultivated land inside the walls.  Farther up the hills are towers that allow
the guards to see far in every direction.  All in all it is a pleasant place
for us to observe.  We enter into the village through a ladder type of
construct which can be drawn up to prevent entry by enemies.  We ask why such
elaborate fortifications for a simple village.  The men tell us that "ones
who come from the sea" attempt to raid the village at irregular intervals and
this is to protect the village.  We ask about the nearest town from here and
they relate that it is rumoured to be 200 to 300 ssan to the west along the
coast.

As we enter the town we meet the Lord of the village Mekan Teshmu.  He is a
hefty man and of pleasant manners.  He tells us stories of the raids of the
"ones who come from the sea".  He tells us of the devasted and wild lands to
the east.  He cannot relate a satisfactory tale of the village we visited
last night.  No one from this village will travel there.  He knows of the
Lord of Blood, but his village is not worth the effort to conquer, so they
leave it alone.  About three or four ssan away to the west is Makumaya's
Head.  This is the promontary to that contains the old observation towers
used by the pirates who used be along this coast and then used by villagers
to look for pirates.  At this time, it is used as a roosting place for
numerous birds. He offers us the hospitality of his village.  We accept.

Eventually we learn that the women of this village are hideous in appearance.
 They are stunted and hairy and have trouble conceiving.  We also learn that
they have trouble growing vegetables here.  One of the locals points to a
steel obelisk that juts from the ground.  He tells us that it glows at night.
 The legend is that Lord Harakan threw it at Lord Huru from the heavens.  It
landed here and it sits in the earth. One of the youth climbed to the top and
founds cranks and wheels.  He died shortly after.  His hair and teeth fell
off and he developed burns and blisters on his body.  At this time a tall
thin woamn who is the priestess of Nallal approached us.  She is the
priestess of this village. Her name is Lasha.

Hear Ye, Hear Ye!  A new article is available on the FTP site.  It was 
lovingly typed by Kenji Schwarz, (about 1.2 years ago) and is titled,
The Temple of Vimuhla.  I scanned the pictures from the article today,
and I have included them at the end of the article.  

Please note, I am now creating Acrobat 3.0 documents now.  I will upgrade
the old ones from 2.1 to 3.0 at some time in the future.

The file is 288K in size, and can be found in the articles subdirectory.

Thank you Kenji for not flaying me for taking an inexcusable amount of 
time getting it together and ready for public viewing.

Hey, that's one long-standing item off my todo list.  Next, I'm going to
spend a few hours on the sourcebook.

[                   on Real Tekumel these days.  I have put forth the ques-  ]

>it has been a while since we had any update on current events on

Our gaming parties are now elsewhere: the Thursday nighters are on the
other side of Tekumel enjoying a war with the Hokun. The old Tuesday night
group is now in Engsvanyali times, doing political things with the chief of
the Priestkings in Ganga. Both are having fun, but neither can shed much
light on events on what I have come to call "North Tekumel."

In fact, Rereshqala now owns the southeastern quarter of the country, from
the Missuma river on the west, over to the western border of Chaigari,
north to Sokatis and south to the coast (plus some of the isles). Eselne
owns the northwest, down as far as Tumissa, which still refuses to allow
*any* Prince inside its fabled fortifications. Eselne himself is rumoured
to have died in the battle in the river just north of Usenanu -- he hasn't

been seen -- except from a distance -- for a month or more; Mirusiya
besieged Avanthar, got nowhere, and is now busy starving the fortress
preparatory to another assault, together with young Taksuru; Ma'in Kruthai
is in Katalal, drumming up support for Eselne, who has offered her the best
deal she can get: First Wife of the Emperor (Eselne), when things
stabilise.  Mirusiya still has problems with Eselne; these two just 
don't get along.

Emperor Dhich'une has now run out of human troops inside the citadel 
and is resorting to creatures "borrowed" (or "rented" perhaps with
Avanthar's stored treasures) from Other Planes. He doesn't want to use his
Undead because all but the Jajgis are too slow and need too much direct
supervision compared to humans. However, there are lots of creatures and
races out there who would enjoy lunching on Tekumel...

The Salarvyani have retreated from Ferinara and the Chaigari. Apparently
there are political tussles at home, which nobody has seen fit to tell me
about! The Mu'ugalavyani are stable and stationary in Pan Chaka. It is
rumoured that they are planning an assault along the coast and through the
swamps to take Penom (don't ask me why they want it) to use as a seaport
for a major invasion later.

Things are messy. Exciting, though!

Most Tsolyani arms and armour are made to order for specific legions. This
is very true for the heavy infantry, medium infantry, and many others: the
"name" Legions of the Empire. The draftees (conscripts, lesser Cohorts,
supply troops, road guards, city guards, and the like) are usually issued
their gear when they need it and not before. Sometimes it fits and
sometimes it doesn't. Reminds me of a siege at the beginning of the war with
Yan Kor a few years back: the great Ahanbasrim, who later perished in
"Flamesong," was given a dose of amnesia by an enemy; he was wandering
around Khirgar when a recuiting party picked him up and drafted him to
serve in the coming battle. For some reason he was issued a helmet that had
a crest fastened on with a bolt and nut that protruded doesn into the
interior od the helmet. He spent the next month bemoaning the headache it
gave him. This, however, is a realistic portrayal of "universal" soldier's
equipment. Ouch...

What the picture depicts is accurate: the Tsolyani support legions that
were brought to serve in Yan Kor during that long struggle. Some of these
troops are sappers, artillerymen, or just cannon-fodder.

The Legion fought well in the Atkolel Heights, but was badly pummeled when
it tried to advance into Pijena. Eselne disliked the General and eventually
persuaded his father (the God Emperor) to order him home to Avanthar, where
he became a bureaucrat in the Chancery. He has not been heard from since
Dhich'une took over.

Hope this helps,

Professor Barker's addition.

I see that I forgot to mention that Tsolyani troops enganged in combat do
not wear their fancy parade dress uniforms, which are what the miniatures
represent. At a siege they are usually issued "siege coats" of leather with
bronze plates sewn inside at crucial places, plus helmets with a wider,
deeper brim and greater thickness.  It is hard to tell which Legion is
which at a siege, thus.

Could someone tell me who this refers to, exactly?  "Basrim" sounds familiar,
but I don't have my Tsolyani dictionary to hand...

Professor Barker's answer.

Joe asks about "Ahanbasrim," which means "Iron Man" in Tsolyuan: /ahan/
"iron" + /basrim/ "man". It was the nickname taken by Craig Smith, who used
to game Tekumel. He was a wonderful player and a good artist who drew some
of the earlier pictures of Tekumel. He lost interest eventually and drifted
away.

Dwight's Question.
I have a question regarding figures for Mu'ugalavya and the Ahoggya. First,
has anyone produced a figure for the Company of the Mourners in Sable? Would
figures for the Legion of Destroy in Glory be a likely substitute, and would
the overall color scheme be more black rather than red? As far as the Ahoggya
are concerned, does anybody have any of the tall armored or unarmed ahoggya
figures available? I didn't see any in PHD's downloaded pricelist.

     Does anybody use Legions of the Petal Throne for their wargames? I have
a copy of it and like the simple mechanics utilised in it. I am picking up a
copy of Missum fairly soon to add to my collection of Tekumel wargames.
Anybody in the Washington area play any of the games? I'd love to hear from
you.

The only published battle report was the battle of the Temple of Chanis,
which does not relate to the war in Yan Kor per se. This article was
originally issued in "The Wargamer," about 1974 (?). It was later
republished in vol. one of the "Best of the Journal" magazines. Another
article, "The Battle of Ry, [i.e. /r/ + an umlaut u) was published in vol.
three of "The Best of the Journals." Perhaps Carl Brodt might still have a
copy of these? Or be willing to republish them?

I don't have a battle array list of the forces for this battle, which was
fought in a straggling, unruly fashion in the copses north of Chene Ho. The
Mighty of Jakalla faced one of the Gurek of the Valiant of Ke'er, but I
don't recall which commander it was. I know that Lord Fu Hsi was not there.
The Yan Koryani tried to advance through brush and stands of trees and got
pounded.

He did indeed renounce the Gold. Once this step is taken, it cannot ever be
taken back or undone. Your factions know about this but are hoping against
hope that *all* of the present Princes will kill themselves off and require
a rewriting of Imperial law. They really are aware that this cannot be
done, and that there are enough witnesses and documentary evidence to prove
irrefutably that Surundano really did give up the Gold. My advice? Try to
join Rereshqala or Eselne.

Legion-level armourers usually have skills in cutting and fitting armour.
Few are trained as tanners, since tanning hides is considered a smelly and
somewhat degrading occupation. If time and supply considerations permit,
most arms and armour are sent to supply depots, there to be junked or
remade into something serviceable. (At Aqesha, one officer's batman sent a
rusted steel sword for polishing; the armourer misunderstood and ground the
blade down into dagger-length. He now has the sharpest, brightest dagger in
Empire -- and the *only* dagger with an Engsvanyali court sword hilt!

These questions should really be put to a priest of Sarku. If Dhich'une
wished, he could "sire" a child through one or another of the machines of
the Ancients. What it would look like no one can guess. Not pretty,
probably...

[                   no telling what the "child" would be or look like!      ]

Lord Sarku has shown no imperialist tendencies. Turning all the world into
Undead-land would create problems for him, and the citizens of other
nations would certainly band together to halt this move. Remember, there
have been Sarku-worshipping emperors before, and they worked fairly hard
for the benefit of the Empire. The only quibble with Dhich'une is they way
he got onto the Petal Throne.

The priesthoods are not as hostile to one another as some Terran groups and
factions here. They cooperate in various ways and try to stay out of each
other's faces. Yes, the priesthoods agreed long ago that the Keys would be
operated each by its respective temple, and that there would always be a
trained priest or priestess available to do this task (it can't be
performed without long physical and spiritual training).

[Moderator's Note:  Jeff Myhre asks about the OAL.  And as an added bonus]

The OAL is used to the changing religious affiliations of the reigning
Emperors. It is rumoured that they had a candidate ready to take over the
generalship as soon as Dhich'une took power. The legion has been mostly
colourless and inactive since the change: many of the troops were
worshippers of Stability, or of the "war" factions of Karakan, Chegarra,
Vimuhla, or Chiteng, and they preferred to stay out of the action until
they could see their course more clearly. Some of the Legion's officers did
want peace, with Dhich'une or without him, but this did not transpire.
Instead, they ended up in fragments that tend to go with the Prince ruling
their area: those in Thraya, etc. are loyal to Rereshqala, while those in
Paya Gupa are loyal to Eselne; those in Tumissa follow a neutralist policy
preferring local autonomy; in Fasiltum many of the old OAL were killed, due
to the Vriddi hatred of central Imperial control; in Bey Su the youngest
revealed Prince, Taksuru, has sent some of the military arm of the OAL into
battle on the walls of Avanthar. A lot of bright young bureaucrats took the
awful plunge down the cliffs into the foaming Missuma River...

The biggest fragment of the OAL military arm right now is that of Prince
Eselne. These troops are based at Chene Ho and are readying themselves to
march east to take the City of Sarku (a terrible and near-impossible
task!). If Eselne decides this is too difficult, he may send them down to
Tsuru to confront Taksuru's rearguard. Mirusiya will then have to take
action, using units of his Red Devastation legion posted there.

A busy day in good old Tsolyanu...

To my knowledge there never was a figure for the Mourners in Sable. The
figure would not be much needed on the battlefield, although it would look
very nice in  a palace scene. Destroy in Glory can be used as a substitute,
but might need some modification. Compare the pictures in the third "Army
List: Mu'ugalavya."

I just heard from the author of "Legions of the PT," Dave Sutherland. He is
now out in Seattle, apparently with new plans after leaving TSR. He is a
wonderful sculptor and artist. His rules were never all that popular,
mostly because the casualty rate was so high. Missum did better.

Yes, each of the five army lists (Tsolyanu, Yan Kor & allies, Mu'ugalavya,
Salarvya, and Livyanu) contains a single page at the end giving colour
abbreviations and which legions use these colours for their uniforms, The
republished army lists can be had from Carl Brodt (carlbrodt@aol.com). He
has also republished "Missum."

I take it, then, that despite popular guessing, Rereshqala never did renounce

Yes and no.  I do not have a specific list of "metals precious to the God" or
"jewels precious to the God" in Mitlanyal, although certain predilictions are
mentioned, such as Sarku's love of copper.  Hnalla loves clear crystals
of course.  Each chapter includes the Gods color, planet, and costume
information, as well as preferred sacrifices.  However I didn't want to
start compiling a "list" like one has for the States:  state bird, state
flower, state motto, state pastry, state feminine hygiene product, etc., 
etc., as that strikes me as tiresome.

There IS a "numerology" entry for each of the Ten outlining their 
numerological preferences.  I don't have the book in front of me
to give you any more detail, except what memory serves:  Hnalla is 1,
Karakan 3, Vimuhla 9, Sarku 5, Dlamelish 8(?).  Each God also enjoys
the corresponding letter of the Tsolyani alphabet.  Various techniques
involve meditating upon these holy numerals and letters to achive
harmony with the God.

Since I've just joined the list, I thought I'd introduce myself. If you've
received this 'introductory blurb' before personally, my apologies!

My name is Peter Gifford, I live in Sydney, Australia and I run a small
graphic design company called Universal Head Graphics.  The Empire of the
Petal Throne has always had 'a special place in my heart' - I spent many
hours of my youth immersed in the world of Tekumel - but I'd put it all
aside for many years until I recently discovered a copy of "The Man of

Now that I'm a professional graphic designer I find it frustrating that
this fantastic creation has never been published with major backing. For
example, the cramped layout of my copy of Swords & Glory Vol1 makes it
nearly unreadable. It seems a shame that Tolkein's MiddleEarth is known the
world over but Barker's Tekumel is known only to a relatively small group
of role-playing gamers (or so it seems). It would be a worthy achievement
to get Tekumel the public recognition it deserves.

So I thought it was time to attempt to give the world of Tekumel some more
exposure, and also try and create some visuals that reflect some of its
unique atmosphere.  I thought I'd attempt to create something that could
act as a 'nexus' for Tekumel fans, and also try and get more people
interested in the world (and who knows, maybe a major publisher). I've
already had positive feedback from people who had never heard of Tekumel.

The  new website is at:

http://www.magna.com.au/~unihead/tekumel/

There's not much content there yet, but the basic site structure is set up
and ready to be filled. I would love to eventually get Professor Barker's
blessing for the site (apparently he's aware it exists), but in the
meantime I welcome comments, contributions and ideas from all those
interested in Tekumel and the development of this site. I'm a better
designer than writer, so I need help in preparing short summaries of
Tekumel information for the "unitiated". Visit the site and you'll see what
I mean. For example, I've just begun the Nonhuman section, with a blurb and
an illustration on the Ayoggya. At the moment the text is paraphrased from
Swords and Glory, but I'd prefer original descriptions of about the same
length. It may be however that Professor Barker doesn't mind me slavishly
copying selected extracts - I've yet to discuss it with him.

Some other notes:
Yep, it uses a bit of JavaScript, there's one relatively large graphic on
the home page - obviously its not designed for old browsers. I wanted to
make something that's exciting and very visual though, not just slabs of
text. Do you think I'm alienating too many visitors? There is a
lower-bandwidth home page however.

Obviously this MY personal interpretation of Tekumel, others, including
Professor Barker's, may be very different. Hopefully the look and feel will
evolve with continued input.

Do you think people who are interested in Tekumel will be interested in a
site like this? Are you?

The whole-thing is of course non-profit; the only personal advantage I can
imagine out of the whole thing is if one day there is finally some
high-quality published material on Tekumel, hopefully I can get a stab at
being the graphic designer!

That's about it for now. Visit the site, and please write to me with your
comments and hopefully, your contributions. Let's give this incredible work
of imagination the exposure it deserves.

Looking forward to the material on this list - thanks!

Regards,

Dwight Grosso asked about anyone having some of the 'old' (as if the
other figures are 'new'.....) taller Ahoggya.  We removed them from the
catalog since they are WAY out of scale.  However, I still have the molds for
them and could produce them as a special request.

As far as other 'new' figures go.....  We are MORE than willing to add
to the line of miniatures.  We will produce any figure that is appropriate to
Tekumel and that I have a well sculpted master for.  So if anyone wants to
see new legions represented, just sculpt one!   Anyone who feels he might be
able to do some sculpting, contact me directly at PHDGames1@AOL.com and we
can 'talk' about it.

at best.  It seems that at my fief every week brings another faction of
another army laying claim to my lands and buildings.  As soon as I heard
that Dhichune had taken the throne I removed my OAL ring.  I soon found out
that many of my contacts had been killed and that the 'new' OAL had been
issued new rings.  As for myself, I am doing my best to help whoever I can
to get Dhichune off the throne.  In my personal opinion many ancient laws
were broken in calling the Kolumejalim, and he needs to be removed.  Once
that is done, my support will be thrown to Mirusiya.  Although I am a
priest of Thumis, I have reasons to support him.  One day I hope to be able
to submit myself to the golden tower that I may be placed back into my
position within the OAL, but until that time I difuse the question 'Who do
you support?' with my now favorite phrase, 'I support the Petal Throne.'

Joe's Response.
Some of this material appears in _Mitlanyal_, but since Bob is going to go
blabbing the secrets of the Universe, I'll break security and make sure people
get the *accurate* ones.  Numbers are from the "Tsolyani Numerology" article,
written by Korumtai hiMnettukeng and translated by Firu Ba Yeker.

(Incidentally, I typed it in as source material for Bob.  If he and the Noble
 Firu think it's appropriate, I can make electronic copy of the article
 available for the Blue Room Archive.  If it's all in _Mitlanyal_ anyway, I
 won't.)

Some of those are right.  Attempting to harmonize with Lady Dlamelish using the

>>>week and
>>>the like.
 Found the answer int the Spring 1987 edition of the Imperial Courier. The
Professer wrote an article on Tsolyani Numerology. The gods numbers are:
   1 - Hnalla  (of Course)
   2 - Avanthe
   3 - Karakan
   4 - Belkhanu
   5 - Sarku
   6 - Thumis
   7 - Hru'u
   8 - Ksarul
   9 - Vimhula
  10 - Dlamelish

As for the other items, the priests generally favor items resembling their
colors. Hence saphires for Avanthe, Rubies for Karakan. Some of this is
also set down in the above article where Phil talks about the mediation
required in the study. The article is essentially an overview of the
Tsolyani equivalent of Qabalah. Speaking of such, the study of Qabalah can
give some decent insight to the Tsolyani Gods. The archtypes the Barker
uses for the Tsolyani gods are present in our owm mystical heritage. (to
some degree or another).

BTW, with the several postings about miniatures, I'm getting ready to start
doing some playtesting of my own version of the Tekumel miniature rules.
They are a combination of Missum, Qadardalikoi, and my own ideas. My goal
has been to keep the feel of Tekumel battles and on simplicity. Most
Tekumel miniatures are played at conventions these days, so it is important
to have simple (but not simplistic) rules. I should have the first cut at
the preliminary rules done in the next month or so, and I would like to
have a few playtesters to proof-read my rules and to see how they work in
real games. I am ony interested in about 2 or 3 people at this time, and
you must be willing to actually play the game (or GM it for others). If you
are interested, drop me a line at wdf@indra.com.

Charlie Goering might have been referring to the preferences of the
demons/extra-planar creatures that "work" for the various Gods, as
referred to in the spell details in the spell volume in one of the

>Brendan Knox

I don't know of prisons built for "heretics." Heresy -- disbelief in
established doctrine(s) -- is relatively rare in Tsolyanu's pluralistic,
rather tolerant society. It is not often a problem. The Tsolyani have many
religious societies, some of which are "secret" and some are political or
social. These would have been considered "heresy" in a mediaeval European
societal context, but on Tekumel there is no *single* established doctrine,
no Pope, no dogma, etc. Hence, the concept of "heresy" rarely arises. Much
more common are crimes against the Concordat, as well as personal crimes:
e.g. theft from temple funds or goods, peculation, the selling of
promotions, fights between priests, failure to perform assigned duties,
etc. A few priests recently have been charged with treachery by Emperor
Dhich'une -- they chose another of the Imperial Princes instead of him, 
and did things that he considered too much.

It is possible, of course, for a felon (of any sort) to end up imprisoned
in a Ruby Eye or other device of the Ancients. I have used that gambit
myself.

I don't know much about Ruvadis myself. He has a "tower" (ruined, possibly
the keep of some ancient fortress) outside Jakalla. It is rumoured that
Ruvadis was a Bednalljan (?) who became one of the Undying Wizards. One
story says that he was ousted from that high position because of his
inordinate loyalty to the Pariah Deities, specifically the Goddess Whose
Name Cannot be Mentioned. He was imprisoned in his tower with no companions
and nothing to do but curse his miserable, lonely fate. No one can befriend
him or communicate with him, except in dreams and "visions." He is thus
thought of as a sort of "ghost" by the peasants and townsmen in the
neighbourhood. Visits by Imperial officers, tax collectors, scholars, etc.
have all proved fruitless, and not all of the visitors have returned alive
(or even dead!)

Those who have visited the deserted, broken tower have never found their
way into any underground tunnels or caverns, but that does not mean that
they don't exist.

I put Ruvadis' tower on the map just in case somebody wanted a rather
dangerous adventure close to the city. Otherwise, one might have to spend
days, weeks, or months on the road to a place where "real adventure" might
be found.

Chlen-hide "mail" consists of rings stamped from the smaller scraps and
remains of larger pieces. These are joined together with other rings which
have been cut open and are later sealed shut again with a special compound
known to the armourers' clans. This is equivalent to European butted and
welded links, though not as strong. It does use up many scraps of
chlen-hide that otherwise would be wasted. Using poor children as
near-slaves to produce it, this stuff is made in quantities large enough to
create mail coats, aventails, etc.

Bob Alberti informed me today that he might consider doing a pre-publication
run of Mitlanyal.  He is printing a few copies that should be done by Monday.
These copies are pretty much for copyright purposes, and to shop around to
a publisher.  They would have NO artwork or Maps, just 208 pages of text.

He is considering doing a pre-publication run if there is enough interest.
It would probably involve a pre-payment of funds, and a deadline as to when
the payment MUST reach him.  So, if you are interested, you should write to
Bob and let him know your interest.  Remember, this is pre-production, and
it does NOT entitle you to a published version when it is released.  You'll
have to visit the store just like everyone else.

If you are interested, I suggest that you write to Bob directly at this

[Moderator's Note:  Gordon and I finished our vampire discussion in private ]
[                   email and came to some interesting conclusions.  Here is]
[                   the relevant part of that conversation.                 ]

[From Gordon]
7/26/97

        Message 507: Yeshua Kristos, Chris, you really tore a bleeding
-chunk- out of my hindquarters here, didn't you then? I can't recall the
last time I was 'flogged round the fleet' from first paragraph to last like
that.
        Yow.

        As to your oft-repeated question 'Why,' well, why what? Why do the
Ssu have a permanent case of 'peel,' why do the Pe Choi drown in a half-
meter of water, why is it 'the Five Empires' and not 'the Eight'?
        Because that's the way the world came off the potter's wheel,
that's why.

"Why does it have to be that way?  Even if it were the same, why would that
imply it was utilized in the same way?"
        Well, I can only give you an insultingly obvious reason-- because
it IS that way. (As you know, a locomotive boiler involves fire-heat and
steam-pressure. Now try building one entirely of balsa wood. Oops-- didn't
work too well, did it? That's because of... the way they are. Steam and
balsa alike.)

"... but the principles involved could be vastly different."
        They could be, but they're -not-; the only variance, if it is one,
is the 'explanation,' which Prof Barker himself said was a conscious
decision to reflect a science fictional basis.
        Everything else-- scrolls, chants, amulets, 'demons,' &c., is
classic thaumaturgy, as practiced with only local variations all around the
world. (Like, sun-worship practiced from China to Ireland-- the long way
around-- as an obvious example.)

        Every one of those cultures contains the undead legends too, the
vryolakos, the nosferatu, the vampire, Bamnp, whatever they happen to call
it.
        Why should you be so explicitly choosy on one point, when none of
these cultures are?

"Why?  What is the rationale for a creature to shrink from a priest/mage
from another temple?  In some cases, the temples work with their
counterpart more effectively with others of their own group.   I just don't
buy your hypothesis... Am I missing the point?"

        Well, only because you come upon it from the opposite direction;
what I was saying is, why NOT?

"What is the rationale for a creature to shrink from a priest/mage from
another temple?"
        Are you suggesting that NONE EVER do? No Tsuru'um creature of
crawling chaos ever feels discretion to be the better part of valor when
confronted by a sorcerer priest of Stability-- or vice versa?

"I like the fact that Tekumelani undead are different."

        Yah, so I gather... but I'm arguing the traditionalist view here.
Prof Barker knew what he was writing about, after all, he'd seen it or
heard its counterparts extensively.
        The one -whopping- fundamental social change that exists is the
absence of riding animals-- in the Bronze Age the absence of iron was just
as complete as though it weren't there to -be- mined, as is the case on
Tekumel. But even the flint axe-makers at Great Langdale knew about horses.
        Okay-- that's the one change. But the people of Tekumel know about
flint... They also work magic in the same traditions; they bury their dead.

        You see what I'm saying, here. If a 'priest' can chant a 'spell' to
work 'magic,' then why can't 'vampire' mean just what those other words
mean-- that is, have the accustomed meaning as well?
        Same processes... same mechanisms... same results. (Heck, the
jajgi, as given, could be undone by direct sunlight. Whoopty do... but that
would creep into the folklore, just as it did here for who-knows-why. The
jajgi would simply be like the ninja-- traditionally, only seen at night,
and then you don't -want- to.)

        What I say is
        a)  there's nothing -I- have ever read that FORBIDS the notion--
and that's a thumpingly heavy collection of materials, by now-- and
        b)  it ought not, then, to be thrown out with -quite- such force,
without an equally solid, understandable reason. Again: In saying 'they
ain't none cuz I saez they aint none,' you're departing from established
Terrestrial precedent, upon which Tekumel's culture is based and has
evolved.

        Bit of a -jump-, doing that, eh?

        It also puts you in no better position than where someone else
could just say. "If your Tekumel doesn't have 'classic undead', fine.  Just
don't expect them to have vanished from anyone elses..."
-- I don't mean that misquote to be insulting, I'm just saying, what makes
your version 'better'?

[My reply to Gordon.]

Sorry!  I just don't understand your need to have classic vampires on 
Tekumel.

You've stolen my point!  It came off the wheel without those classic vampires.
Why are you so keen on adding them?

Remember, ~60,000 years of evolution have spun by.  Things could be vastly
different.  Who knows, maybe Jajgi are the natural extension of classical 
vampires.  Maybe in a rich magic environment, blood drinking, bat and wolf
morphing, mist evarporation are no longer necessary to survival!  :)

Are they the same.  I thought the undead myths were all fairly different.  
The one thing was that they needed blood to survive.  Some more than others,
but I am not an historian of Earth mythology.

Because there is nothing intrinsically existent in a priest or priestess.
If they are casting a spell, that is another story.

If the sorceror is wielding spells, or weapons, or techno-magical devices,
you betcha!  If it is just a shoeless tattered priest, with no visible means
of protection, well, burp!

Some burn, which we also do.  It is rumored that some eat their dead, too.

Just because spellcasting exists, and magic exists, does not mean that 
vampires must exist.

As I said before, Jajgi could be the evolution of a vampire.  I just don't 
know.

Talking from a earth present point of view, nothing we know of Tekumel says
that there are any.  The Professor has the last word on that.  As far as I
know, the Professor "saez they aint none" so I am happy to accept that fact.

Nope.  It is a moot point, as we are talking about fiction, though!  :)

No insult taken.  That is fine.  It just is worded a bit differently.  I din't
mean to take such a chunk out of your hindquarters.  I just couldn't (and 
can't) understand why it seemed you "needed" vampires to exist.  I agree that
it is an interesting idea, with respect to history, and that their view would
be unique. (or was that someone elses idea??)  I am getting confused.  :)

Here, have that chunk back....  Sorry, didn't meant to go overboard.

        No, that was me-- and that is the limit of my interest in the
matter, really. As I see it, you gave the quietus to the whole thing; I
asked 'why not,' and you gave some solid reasons:

"Remember, ~60,000 years of evolution have spun by.  Things could be vastly
different.  Who knows, maybe Jajgi are the natural extension of classical
vampires.  Maybe in a rich magic environment, blood drinking, (&c.) are no
longer necessary to survival!"
 
        Okay. Works for me-- that IS a heck of a long time.

"The Professor has the last word on that.  As far as I know, the Professor
'saez they aint none' so I am happy to accept that fact."

        Yah, I guess I'd have to also, happy or not, eh?

        On the other hand, what's a 'discussion group' -for-, if not to
rouse up interest, thoughtful consideration, and thrown pottery every once
in a while?
[Agreed!]

(chris--

(thought i'd make a quick response to Mr. Neff's comments, and thanks for
your own contribution, but i doubt if you want to get into a discussion
of game mechanics, so i'll just add this last. . .)

just to clarify a couple of things:  i mentioned the Qon priest
specifically because Lord Qon's sphere of influence was specifically
anti-demons ("the guardian of the gates of hell against those who would
come forth," etc etc), and thus his servitors would probably be the
exorcists of choice in Tsolyanu.  

i mentioned the World of Darkness series for a couple of reasons:  they
provide a system (or point of view) of playing 'monsters' or 'outsiders',
which might be an interesting way to experience Tekumel;  they have
simpler game mechanics, emphasizing role-playing over roll-playing; and
they're pretty popular--perhaps more familiar to newcomers?  At least one
website has a number of tekumel-other game system translations available,
so this was just one more suggestion, although as the Professor replied,
they are extremely medieval/judeochristian (etc) oriented and there is
little tekumelyani mythology/iconography to extrapolate new 'paradigms
for the supernatural'  from. . .alas.

just a thought.

[Moderator's Note:  David Cheng informs us that James Roach, creator of the ]
[                   Fanzine, Realms of Wonder passed away recently. The Prof]
[                   adds a note of condolence.                              ]

I got a call a couple of days ago.  It was Tim Eichhorst, one of the guys
who regularly contributed to James Roach's Tekumel-heavy fanzine, _Realms
of Wonder_.

Tim regrets to tell us that Jim Roach died on July 26th, 1997.  We didn't
really get into the details of his passing, but I know from my personal
conversations with Jim that he had recurring health problems.

Jim produced over 30 issues of _Realms of Wonder_ in the six-plus years he
self-published the fanzine.  The contents were almost entirely fictional
stories inspired by his alternate-Tekumel house campaign.  My favorite
pieces were the retouched photos of his extensive Tekumel miniatures
collection, and of Jim and his fellow players in Tekumelyani costume.  (I
regret I was not a subscriber from the beginning, so I can't give you a
more accurate account of when Jim started, or just how many issues he
produced.)

Jim's page layout skills developed from not-so-good to passable as the
magazine progressed.  Some discounted his efforts because of this.  And,
some Tekumel fans have criticized the alternate-ness of his alternate
Tekumel.

I'd like to point out that Jim Roach's dedication to promoting Tekumel
motivated him to produce a fanzine for several years, spending money out of
his own pocket to do so.  Let's remember him positively for this, because
that's more than most of us have done.

*David Cheng
August 20, 1997

[Professor Barker's addition.]

Please forward my condolences on the passing of James Roach to the
appropriate persons. Such a devoted fan of Tekumel deserves to be
recognised for his contribution. I did not always agree with his view of
Tekumelani society, but I did respect his energy and loyalty to the mythos.

Sadly,
M. A. R. Barker

[Moderator's Note:  Jim Chapin found the list of prefered items he was looking]
[                   for.  It was from the Players Book of Swords and Glory.   ]

Specifically (now that I have found it!)  I was referring to the "Demonology"
spell, listed on pp. 175-178 of Swords and Glory, Volume 2.  

Avanthe's Spirits of Air, Water and Earth bargain for magical knowledge;
Belkhanu's Voyagers of the Farther Isles bargain only for gold and yellow 
gems; Dlamelish's Aeriel Ones of Tu'unkelmu  "bargain only for gold, silver, 
and other precious metals; they have no interest in gems and other items,"  
Hnalla's Entities of Light bargain for magical devices, books, spells, 
scrolls, Hru'u's Demons of the Dark bargain only for articles made of steel 
or Sarku's enchanted copper; Karakan's Heroes of Glory and Chegarra's 
Warriors of Scarlet bargain only for articles of excellent or enchanted 
steel, although they may occasionally accept gold; Ksarul's Dwellers in 
Shadow bargain for anything blue, preferring blue gems, but occasionally 
accepting blue-lacquered armor or blue cloth; Gruganu's Azure Denizens 
accept the sacrifice of D5 intelligent beings; Sarku's Tsughiyur bargain 
for gems; his undead followers do not bargain but are sent by their master; 
Durritlamish's Half-People of Nguyom bargain for human flesh, while his 
Blind Ones of Hreshkaggetl want gold, gems, copper and armor (preferably 
enchanted copper); Thumis' Mighty Ones of the Pearl Mists want magical 
books and scrolls, but may accept a spell taken from memory; Ketengku's 
Watchers of the High Tower prefer spells taken directly from memory; 
Vimuhla's Flame Dragons want D5 intelligent beings sacrificed, while the 
Hre-Niriu want anything that can be set on fire.  

If I remember correctly, one can also influence the chance of divine 
intervcention by sacrificing appropriate things to the appropriate Gods.  
Does anyone remember in which set of rules these things are listed?

[Moderator's Note:  If I remember correctly, those rules were in the original]

[Moderator's Note:  Eric Olson has done some research on the Tsolyani Legions]
[                   and their Religious affiliations.                        ]

Religious Affiliations of Tsolyani Legions:

	Being a new member of the Blue Room, I wanted to see if I 
could add something to the general knowledge base or at least spark 
some discussion.  I decided to base my input on one of my favorite 
documents, the Deeds of the Ever-Glorious.  Having read the document 
at least a dozen times, I felt that there was an imbalance between 
those legions who were directly affiliated with the Gods of Stability 
and those directly affiliated with the Gods of Change.  What I have 
attempted to do is break down the predominantly Human/Nluss legions 
by religious affiliation.  I hope the list will be useful as a reference.

	Below is a breakdown of the 70 Human/Nluss legions by religious 
affiliation.  I have not included the Omnipotent Azure Legion or the 
Legion of Ketl due to their specialized functions.  The list groups 
each God with his Cohort and also lists the number of military cohorts 
(at the time of the printing of Deeds/Armies of Tekumel Vol. I - pre-war)
directly affiliated with the God/Cohort.

Gods/Cohorts of Stability:  16 Legions, 223 Cohorts
Hnalla:  (40)
    The Legion of Hnalla, Master of Light; 4th Heavy Infantry   (20)
    The Legion of the Joyful Clan of Noble Vrayani; 3rd Slingers  (20)

Belkanu/Qon:  (22)
    The Legion of the Clan of the Golden Sphere; 13th Medium Infantry (14)
    The Legion of the Defense Against Evil; 27th Medium Infantry (8)

Thumis/Ketengkhu:  (20)
    The Legion of the Lord of Wisdom; 22nd Heavy Infantry (20)

Avanthe/Dilinala:  (29)
    The Legion of Morusai the Chieftain; 40th Medium Infantry  (8)
    The Legion of the Twelve Paths of Avanthe; 9th Slingers  (9)
    The Legion of the Sapphire Kirtle; 12th Light Infantry  (12)

Karakan/Chegarra:  (112)
    The Legion of Serqu, Sword of the Empire; 14th Heavy Infantry (20)
    The Legion of Mnashu of Thri'il; 10th Medium Infantry (17)
    The Golden Sunburst legion; 11th Medium Infantry (17)
    The Cohorts of Chegarra, the Hero King; 12th Medium Infantry (15)
    The Battalions of Sryma of Vra; 39th Medium Infantry (11)
    The Legion of Lord Kharihaya; 14th Crossbow (18)
    The Legion of the Inverted Hand; 27th Light Infantry (15)
    Legion of the Wind of Iron; 10th Crossbow (9)

Gods/Cohorts of Change:  24 Legions, 269 Cohorts
Hruu/Wuru: (28)
    The Legion of the Clan of the Sweet Singers of Nakome; 
                  12th Heavy Infantry (16)
    The Legion of the Deep Purple Dark;  16th Heavy Infantry (3)
    The Legion of the Many-Legged Serpent; 20th Medium Infantry (9)
    
Sarku/Durritlamish: (80)
    The Legion of the Scales of Brown; 9th Heavy Infantry (16)
    The Phalanx of Lord Durritlamish of the Rotted Face; 
                  6th Medium Infantry (16)
    The Battalions of the Seal of the Worm; 9th Medium Infantry (15)
The Armored Vision of Death; 29th Medium Infantry (7)
    The Legion of the Peaks of Kraa; 12th Archers (8)
    The Battalions of Vrishtara the Mole; 2nd  Sappers (18)
    


Ksarul/Gruganu:  (40)
    The Legion of Heketh of Purdimal; 17th Heavy Infantry (18)
    The Legion of the Night of Shadows; 15th Medium Infantry (7)
    The Legion of the Prince of the Blue Room; 35th Medium Infantry (9)
    The Regiment of the Knower of Spells; 5th Crossbow (6)
    
Dark Trinity: (13)
    The Slayers of Cities; 5th Sappers (13)

Dlamelish/Hrihayal:  (8+)
    The Legion of Kaikama of Bey Su; 36th Medium Infantry (8)
    The Legion of the Translucent Emerald; ?? Heavy Infantry (??)

Vimuhla/Chiteng:  (100)
    The Legion of the Givers of Sorrow; 8th Heavy Infantry (16)
    The Legion of the Searing Flame; 10th Heavy Infantry (16)
    The Legion of Lord Kurukaa; 25th Heavy Infantry (6)
    The Legion of the Lord of Red Devastation; 18th Medium Infantry (17)
The Legion of Storm of Fire; 21st Medium Infantry (9)
    The Legion of the Clan of the Broken Bough; 19th Archers (15)
    The Legion of Glorious Destiny; 9th Crossbow (16)
    The Legion of the Citadel of Glory; 13th Crossbow (5)
    

Unaffiliated Legions:  30
    Of the unaffiliated Legions;
13 have commanders who worship Stability Gods
    03 have commanders that worship Change Gods
    14 have no clear affiliation

	The balance between Stability and Change is further muddied 
by the composition of the unaffiliated legions.  If you assume that 
the Legions follow the broad beliefs (Stability/Change) of the 
commanding officers, then the balance of Light and Dark balances out, 
roughly 29 Light, 27 Dark.  If you don't make that assumption and 
instead the unaffiliated legions are opened to all faiths, then the 
Stability/Change numbers are 16 to 24, a decided advantage to Change. 
Currently the legions affiliated with stability tend to be larger then 
the legions of change.  Part of the imbalance is probably due to the 
massive increase in Sarku legions/cohorts due to Dichiune.   However, 
raw numbers don't give you any idea of the actual strength of the 
religiously affiliated legions.  For example one Karakan Legion, the
14th Heavy Infantry - Serqu, Sword of the Empire, could mop the field 
against all three Hruu/Wuru legions (depending on battle magic and use 
of special weapons). 

	I would be interested in getting a feel for the general 
affiliation (Stability/Change) of the unaffiliated legions.  If possible, 
it would be nice to see which legions have sided with each candidate for 
the throne.  Finally, is there any way to update Deeds to reflect the 
recent conflict?

    Interesting sidelines; look at the representation of 
Sarku/Durritlamish vs. Belkanu/Qon (6 vs. 2) and Thumis/Ketengkhu vs. 
Ksarul/Gruganu (1 vs. 4).

Well, what's interesting about these numbers is not so much the simple
Stability/Change ratios, but the manner in which they represent the
interests of these various Temples in military affairs.  This is a
more useful idea of why the numbers are what they are than a simple
test of Stability versus Change.  Remember that for the Tsolyani, this
Stability/Change dichotomy is not a cause for conflict but simply part
of the culture, much the same way that our culture has different
religious philosophies.  Yes, in times of trouble these differences 
can flare into open dispute, but for the most part they are simply
the stuff of debate.  The armies of the various legions are not poised 
to face each other, but to face the foes of the Empire.  In civil
conflicts (such as those going on right now) these armies don't so much
align themselves simply along lines of Stability and Change, as according
to the more complicated influences of loyalty, heritage, philosophy,
politics, and religion, all taken together.

The numbers as given provide a good measure of the political influence
of each with the Military party in the Empire.  Temples which are
disinclined to an interest in military matters (Thumis, Dlamelish) have
correspondingly fewer legions. Karakan and Vimuhla have many, of course.
In the middle, particularly political Temples (Avanthe, Ksarul, Hru'u) have 
sufficient legions to lend them a voice in military politics and allow them
to be "dealmakers."

I'd think not for a few years -- most of the census takers sent out are
either impressed into service and killed in battle, or slain by sentries.

Again, these numbers reflect the interest of those temples in military
poltics.  Ranked in order of such interest, we have Sarku, Ksarul,
Belkhanu and Thumis, which is spot on.

[Moderator's Note:  Professor Barker provides some background on the Undead of]
[                   Tekumel.                                                  ]

I have always figured "vampires" implied a Christian basis: the cross
frightens them away, they morph into wolves and bats, which are animals
that frightened northern Europeans; they fear sunlight (read: "the Light of
God?"); they have hypnotic powers, as do various other mediaeval monsters,
etc. Tekumel has long ago forgotten about Christianity -- it is much deader
than Mithraism is to us. Sixty thousand years after the Great Fall is a
*long* time. If you want comparisons with Terra, you would have to project
the Eleusinian Mysteries or the worship of the goddess Sekhmet back much
farther and then compare it with the Christianity of today. This still does
not give enough time for the changes needed to reach the great Empire of
Humanspace, which preceded the Time of Darkness on Tekumel.

In any case, I have no *theological* ("religious?") basis for the creatures
of Tekumel. They are not "creatures of the damned" or "monsters from hell."
They are just poor beasties trying to make a living, like the rest of us.
Some of this "evil" did creep into the first EPT because Gary Gygax wanted
my book to mesh well with his and Dave Arneson's D-n-D. This was fine --
then. It was subsequently changed to reflect more of "Tekumel reality" in
the later game versions, the Sourcebook, etc.

There are indeed "undead" on Tekumel, but they are animated not by Satan
(or other religiously-generated figures) but by the impersonal powers of
spells which operate with energies from the Planes Beyond. Tekumelani feel
a repugnance for dead bodies (stinky!) just as present-day Terrans do, and
thus most temples do not participate in the raising of the undead. Only
Sarku-Durritlamish are really interested -- for their own theological
reasons -- and factions from the temples of Hru'u and Ksarul get into the
act on occasion, particularly in setting guardians in the Tsu'urumyal.

Hope this helps!

Regards,

Phil
