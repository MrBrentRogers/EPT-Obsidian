These messages are the accumulation of the messages that were sent out on 
the Blue Room email list between May 1995 and June 2000.  A large portion 
of the information is directly from Professor M.A.R Barker. When the list 
members joined during the time the list was active, they agreed to refrain 
from sharing this data with non list members.  When the list ended, it was 
urged that the data be made available to non-list Tekumel fans, and it 
seemed like a good idea all around.

I only ask that if you download these digests, or have received them in 
some other way, please respect the agreements the list members made, and 
refrain from passing them around and instead point people to the Tekumel

[                   This message comes from Joe Saul.                         ]

I have just had the most phenomenal character generation experience of my 
seventeen-year-long roleplaying career, and I have to share it -- and 
congratulate Professor Barker on his _Adventures on Tekumel_ books.  
They are a powerful tool for getting players involved in the world of 
Tekumel, while educating them at the same time.

I didn't get interested in Tekumel until fairly recently.  Hearing 
stories from friends in a campaign in London convinced me that I should 
really find out more about it, but material was hard to find and I was 
concentrating on both law school and Amber.  Last spring, a game store 
opened up here in Ann Arbor; the manager is an old friend of mine, so I 
agreed to help him out in exchange for an employee discount.

I discovered the _Adventures on Tekumel_ series, and fell in love with 
it.  I quickly bought all the volumes, the _Bestiary_, the _Book of Ebon 
Bindings_, and all the older material the store had on hand (the 
two-volume Tsolyani language set, for example).  I bought a copy of 
_Gardasiyal_.  I cleaned the store out.  (Remember, I get a discount....)

I read the material -- during law finals, no less; fear not, I got an A 
in Patent Law anyway -- and decided that I had to run a campaign in 
Tekumel.  I would use the _AoT_ series as the character generation system.

Various things intervened, though, and I didn't get around to actually 
doing it until this past Saturday.  I still haven't recovered.

Knowing that the generation would be time-consuming, I only had part of 
the group do it at once -- one couple, where she was already quite 
enthusiastic and he was game for it, and my girlfriend (Lisa Leutheuser, now 
a reader of the Blue Room list), who had somewhat mixed feelings, as she 
loved the novels but hates making up new characters and has a novel of her 
own to work on.

I started with Lisa (the others were late), and we forged ahead.  You 
should know, by the by, that I do not generally approve of random 
generation systems.  I prefer to give players a choice.  I had planned to 
adapt the _AoT_ system to allow distribution of points, but Lisa said "I 
don't know what kind of character I want.  Let me see if the dice rolls 
inspire me," and we did just that.  The other two, Paul and Shelley, 
showed up, and I gave them some additional briefing material (courtesy of 
Patrick Brady, a gentleman and a scholar) to read while I got Lisa started.

To make a long story short, we started before 6pm -- and finally had to 
break to eat dinner at 1:15am!  Fortunately, we here in Ann Arbor are 
gifted with an excellent Hong Kong-style restaurant that is open until 2; 
we drove there, ate, returned around 2:45... and then I had to bodily 
throw people out at 4, so I could get some sleep.  Paul and Shelley were 
still busily reading and scribbling to the very end, and Lisa's first 
words to me, as she slid between the sheets, were "About my clan-brothers..."

I have never seen a character generation system which evokes such 
enthusiasm, gives people such a sense of their characters, as _AoT_.  
Tekumel is a complex world, but putting characters through those 
adventures makes the world manageable and gives the players lots of 
information their characters should know.  _AoT_ also makes people think 
very hard about their characters.  "I think my religion has become much 
more important to me; I want to join the temple instead of the Army."  
(following the monastery adventure).  "Penom is a shitty place!"  (you 
can guess the context)  "No more caravans for me; they're long, dusty, 
and you lose all your money."  "I have an unhealthy fascination for 
Livyanu; I am just drawn there..."  One player's face showed genuine 
pain, almost, as he read of the death of his Prince, Eselne (he'll get a 
chance to put it right; I'm planning to run the archeology adventure in 
modified form for the whole group, which should also solidify their 
dislike of Dhich'une).

The result:  much fatigue, plus the following questions:

1.  What are some lineage names for the Might of Ganga and Golden Bough
    clans?
----
Professor Barker answers...
Qolyelmu, Chaishyani, Saynuch, Ssanmirin, some Ssankoral, Ketkolel -- almost 
any will do since there is so much intermarriage at these upper levels of 
society.
----

2.  Are the names of Rereshqala's children known?  Lisa managed to roll up
    a member of the Tlakotani clan, much to my shock.  She is from Jakalla,
    is of great beauty and prowess, and worships Dlamelish, and I 
    wondered if it would be appropriate to cast her as one of the Decadent
    Prince's children.  (If not, I'll probably use him as the "other close
    relative:  clan uncle" she rolled, as an interesting but not very...
    ahem... dynamic political contact.)
----
Professor Barker answers...
Prince Rereshqala's children are indeed known, though I don't think I 
have ever given them. His offspring are particularly prone to parties, 
ceremonials, hunting, and laziness. They'd make very poor player character-
vehicles. Joe can use the Prince as her clan uncle. Poor Rereshqala will 
be horrified to find his niece worshipping Dlamelish, but it serves him 
right -- Princess Ma'in Kruthai has taken refuge with him in his palace 
southeast of Jakalla, after his troops took the city, and she's had a lot 
of influence on his friends and hangers-on. 
----

3.  How does etiquette dictate that the members of Very High clans should
    deal with Tlakotani who are not Imperial heirs?  Is she going to be able
    to speak with them at all informally?
----
Professor Barker answers...
Yes, one can speak to these people informally. Once even speaks to princes 
and princesses with relatively informality -- when they are off-duty, as 
it were. Honorifics are still used in speech, but prostrating oneself
before the glory of the Throne is not necessary. It's rather like our 
world: I gather one no longer has to back out of the presence of Queen 
Elizabeth. One is always respectful, unlike our own American society in 
which humorous insults and ridicule play a larger social role.
----

4.  Anything I should know about the internal customs of any of the clans
    listed?  I'd like to get it right...
----
Professor Barker answers...
This is complex. There really isn't much that MUST be observed, but there 
are lots of small traditions and customs that each clan has that are
valued and hallowed by time. The Might of Ganga, for example, still tries 
to celebrate the acession of the last Priestking of Ganga, but they have 
the date wrong and now commemorate the 1st of hasanpor with all kinds of 
feasting and gift-giving, whereas history says -- possibly incorrectly -- 
that it was _summer_ (month and day not known) when the last Priestking 
ascended the Throne... Who knows?
----

Congratulations, Professor, on a job very well done.  I read the shorter 
passages to people, let them read the longer ones to themselves, made 
sure nobody duplicated anyone else's experiences, and it by the Gods 
*worked* even better than I could have imagined.

To what extent are the political factions organised in Tsolyanu?

Is it the case that like minded individuals informally work together to 
achieve their aims or is it more organised than this.  If it is more formal, 
do people actively join the cause and declare their affiliations?  Knowing 
that the Tsolyani like to visually display and analyse situations, do 
people wear badges or insignia to show political allegiance along with the 
tokens for clan and lineage?

I would presume that the organisation has to be fairly structured so that
any planning or effort can take place at a national level. I imagine that
this often happens outside the normal political organisations of Temple and
Palace in a semi-feudal way based on a structure of obligation and honour 
in a hierarchy of patrons and their followers (clients?).  This 
structure can then operate at the different social levels of society as 
plans for action filter down the patronage structure.

Comments?

[Moderator's Note:  David Bailey wonders about how the Tekumelani take their ]
[                   lunch breaks, both urban and rural diners.               ]

A few of us were idly speculating the other night as to the format of a 
typical Tsolyani lunch time in three different circumstances:

* the first circumstance was in a large Imperial Bureaucracy, say the 
Palace   of the Realm, where people are of a wide range of high clans;

* the second circumstance is within a large merchant clan house; and

* the third is out in the fields, where agricultural clans dominate.

We speculated that the bureaucrats either popped home for lunch in the clan 
refectory, or that they subscribed to a type of 'Avanthar Palanquin Club' 
(modelled on the Bombay Bicycle Club), whereby they exchanged complex 
enamelled tokens for the dish of the day from an army of low clan food 
preparers who distribute thousands of pre prepared meals (and plenty of 
gossip ;-).

For the clan house we expected a rather informal gathering over a period of 
two or three hours, with people assembling a scattered daises and eating 
from four or five set meals.  In the evenings the formal meals would be the 
minefield of social obligations that we know and love about Tsolyani 
culture, but at lunch the atmosphere is a lot more pleasant.  We wondered 
if  representatives groups from closely related clans might 'drop in' at 
lunch as a way of showing friendship, whereas in the evenings, other clans 
only visit under the formalised arrangements of fealty and obligation.  
("Well we always go to see White Crystal on the third evening in Drengar, 
and if we don't how do you expect to get that loan approved?")

Out in the sticks, we imagined a pattern of little groups bringing their 
own meals, with a very few bringing cook pots and charcoal for an informal 
'camp-kitchen' in colder weather.

There is a lot printed on the subject of evenings, and any comments on the 
midday meal would be appreciated.

David Bailey.

>1.  When did Princess Ma'in convert to the worship of Lady Dlamelish?

She was already a devotee of Dlamelish in 2354 when EPT was published. She 
was tricked into conversion sometime before then -- a year or two? She has 
defended herself against any attempt to convert her back to Avanthe! 
Dlamelish may not be all that much of a political power, but her worship 
is FUN.

Most prominent members belong to the Stability temples, but the Tlakotani 
are an eclectic lot, and there is no prejudice or attempt to convert 
Change adherents.

Hard to answer because I myself don't know. I have never had a character 
who is a member. My experiences have always been with the Ndlau Clan or 
some of the other groups. Best take whatever the sources provide and 
build on that. Maybe Bob Alberti will have some ideas -- his primary 
character, Arjai hiVaisoner, is a devotee of Lord Ksarul.

>4.  A related question:  How do the doctrines of the Inner Temple of
>    Ksarul differ from those of the outer?

The outward doctrines are those that concern rituals, prayers, ceremonials, 
and all that goes with them. There is much reliance on mythology, the 
stories of Dormoron Plain, the Blue Room, and that sort of thing. The 
Inner Doctrines cannot be characterised, of course, because they are kept 
a dark secret with all sorts of mind-bars and mental traps to protect them. 
I don't have access to them myself, nor does Arjai hiVaisoner. Arjai's 
wife, Chitlasha, does know, but she cannot confide even in Arjai. Whenever 
these matters come up, I simply tell the players that "those concerned are 
told what they need to know and do accordingly." No details. I know this 
is difficult for inquisitive American players who are used to being "in" 
on all of the secrets of any endeavour in which they engage, but it is 
better, perhaps, that they do NOT know. Some of the doctrines of the 
Dark Lords are actually somewhat unsettling.

I know this doesn't answer all your questions, but I cannot do better.

[Moderator's Note:  Phil responds to Paul's question on Political Factions.  ]

My replies are necessarily fragmentary. THese are complex questions!

>To what extent are the political factions organised in Tsolyanu?

There are no formal "political parties" -- no "New Hampshire Primaries" or 
party caucuses. There are occasional organised meetings, however, at 
clanhouses, temples, etc.,where like-minded folk gather to discuss the 
issues of the day. It is often just a matter of common knowledge that Mr. 
X or Ms. Y is a member of such-and-such a faction and favours a particular 
person or course of action.

There is some official "joining," particularly in the temples, where 
"semret" (really semi-secret) societies are so prevalent and powerful. 
The army, too, has its groupings and staff meetings. In the clanhouses, 
those of the same orientation often get together at dinners, feasts, etc., 
and then political matters are discussed and planned. As far as I know, 
nobody has devised political buttons or bumper slogans for their 
palanquins! A clan symbol or religious icon worn with one's costume often 
carry all the information needed to know who is a partisan of what.

>I would presume that the organisation has to be fairly structured so that

Political organisation at higher levels is indeed structured. Your 
interpretation is correct: the Princes, priests, and high clan leaders 
may gather occasionally to discuss a matter; the recognised leaders 
devise solutions and strategies; these are discussed and outlined to 
those who need to carry them out; and orders are issued through several 
levels down to the lads in the streets. Clan and religious obligations, 
"noble action," and personal loyalties play important roles. Often those 
at lower levels have no idea who the eventual giver of their orders may 
be, but there are authentification procedures at every level in order to 
maintain security.

Political rallies, as such, do not exist, but street demonstrations are 
frequent, with people marching, cheering, carrying torches and icons, 
etc. in favour of this or that leader or point of view. There is little 
"social content" in the usual Western European sense -- no anti-abortion 
marches, or "Free Poor Willy" things. Many of these public ceremonies 
are accompanied by singing, chanting, dancing, drumming, music, people 
carrying censers of incense, others with torches, and all sorts of 
emblems, military standards, and religious icons.  Somebody breaks out 
casks of beer and wine for the marchers, and then there is a party -- 
often a riot. I think Lord Tekunu hiQolyelmu described one such incident 
in one of his dispatches.

Do lunch? Of course!

>* the first circumstance was in a large Imperial Bureaucracy, say the 
>Palace of the Realm, where people are of a wide range of high clans;

Those of like social status may gather at midday when the grerat Tunkul 
gongs signal the midday prayers for Avanthe, Hnalla, and Karakan. The 
bureaucracies may actually employ food-preparation clans to bring in 
pots of stew, bread, etc., which departmental staff members pay a few 
Qirgals for -- or a monthly lunch bill. Soldiers and guardsmen have 
regular "messes," to which they go when off duty to eat and rest. Priests 
may return to their temples, eat with comrades and clan brothers/sisters, 
or buy food from the street vendor clans. Those near enough to their 
clanhouses may go back there and eat in the regular refectories.

Higher officials may gather in somebody's office to eat better quality 
lunches prepared by the food preparation clans. These are a regular 
feature of some bureaucratic offices, cities, and regions but are less 
common in others. It is hard to state a single fast rule. Of course, 
people don't eat with those who are too much higher or lower than 
themselves -- a few levels of difference is all that is normally 
permitted. Player characters find this somewhat unpleasant: Senior 
Priest X is not likely to eat with Guardsman Y, even though the players 
are good buddies outside the game. People don't eat with those of 
unlikely alignments either: a high official who serves Lord Sarku is 
not going to get chummy with a person of his own rank and status who 
worships Lord Hnalla. Should someone have no lunch or anyone to eat 
with, the most that one might do is politely point him/her toward a 
food preparation clan's premises -- or suggest that such and such a 
street vendor makes excellent gegresa.

>* the second circumstance is within a large merchant clan house; and

Each clanhouse has its refectory, as does each temple, and army barracks. 
Clan members (and their guests) can go in at almost any time (except 
late at night when the kitchens are closed) and find food. The quality 
and nature of this repast varies from clan to clan, city to city, etc. 
Members wander in, eat alone or with friends and family, and wander out. 
There are standard breakfast, lunch, and dinner times, but no particular 
serving order or difference in the foods. A breakfast may thus consist of 
Dna-grain porridge, bread, Chumetl, sweet milk, fruit, etc., and these 
same foods may be provided at lunch and dinner, with variations. Fancier 
dishes are found at higher clanhouses, of course, and feasts often involve 
the most incredible confections and dainties.

>* the third is out in the fields, where agricultural clans dominate.

Some of the poorer sectors of society do not have "lunch," however, but 
only a pre-dawn meal on bread, Dna-grain porridge, vegetables, and a 
little meat stew, with copious gulps of Chumetl -- and then off to work. 
During the day there may be brief breaks to munch on the equivalent of a 
leek or chunk of bread. The main meal is then eaten in the evening at the 
clanhouse, temple, etc.

I think you're pretty close, although the "Palanquin Club" sounds a bit 
un-Tekumelani. In some groups, there is a regular monthly lunch bill that 
one pays in order to eat at one's office or bureau (see above).

Some of this sounds very appropriate: lunch is less formal, but clan and 
religious distinctions are maintained. Friends, acquaintances, and relations 
from other clans do drop in -- not just to eat but also to discuss business, 
politics, etc.

People don't normally just "drop in" unless there is a purpose, such as 
business, etc. Friends do get together, as do members of groups, and 
social life may include post-dinner entertainment, drinking, gaming, 
etc. All of this is done within the rather rigid confines of Tsolyani 
society, of course. People do invite others of their own status to 
dinner. Getting together with casual acqaintances or outsiders requires 
a clear purpose, of course.

>Out in the sticks, we imagined a pattern of little groups bringing their

This does happen in the fields and villages. Members of a clan may have 
slaves or clan members of poor or lesser status given the task of cooking 
and arranging for food. Servants are very common, even in fairly low 
level clans.

[Moderator's Note:  Due to demand, Tekunu is continuing with the second in his]
[                   "Adventures around the Fief" series.                      ]

I will continue my adventure at this time.  I am sending a copy of the map 
to the Blue Room (I will have to make a new copy of 1.  My fief's map and 
where it is on Tekumel  2.  The underworld beneath my fief so you may 
follow my adventure on a map.  (I will mark the areas) 3. the Hlyss ship.

-----

It is in this room that we establish the base camp.  I send for guards, my
architect and others and give instructions to widen the openings and the
passage ways so that nobles may gain access without losing their dignity.  I
give instructions to make the room habitable and so forth.  I also require
that the dig be terraced so that gardens may be planted.  Bare earth in a
hole is ignoble.

By the next morning after the fete the area has been widened.  I go down and
can move more easily through the chimney and the other areas.  The room is
starting to look better.  Furniture, mats, and a refreshment center have
been established.  I decide to wait until we can form an archeology team from
various temples.  In the meantime I watch my servents, carpenters, stone
masons, and artists begin to decorate the base camp.  I am satisfied with
their work.

The archeology team is finally decided upon.  We have Hajara hi Vuunnauu of
the Jade Diadem clan.  We have Kamr and Trimur hi Seshmuel.(Thumis) We have
Odusuna hi' Vesura (Avanthe). Dijai  hi Relsa (Belkhanu) and Adjel (Thumis).
Janach hi'Ssaiura (archeologist student) We decide that we will allow all
and any temple to come here to explore. At the reception I meet Hajara who is
soon to become my steady squeeze during this time.

We take about six soldiers and about a dozen slaves.  We explore the
stairwell down.  It is rough hewn and not regular.  It is only about 2 1/2
ft. wide.  Upon closer inspection I note that the marks from the chisel cut
up and not down.  The stairway was started at the base and worked up from
that point.  We work out way through to the bottom and find a rough,
triangular shaped room.  The apex is where we are and the base is a metal
wall where it was busted through.  We enter through to the room beyond.  It
is a thirty foot by forty foot room covered with dust.  There are two metal
boxes in the room that are 3' tall by 4' square.  The walls and the tooms are
[Moderator's Notes:  tooms?                                                  ]
metal on the far wall from where we entered is a thick round metal door.  We
open the door and a fifteen foot wide and tall hall way leading away from the
room.  The floor is coverered with sand, dirt and all sorts of fish bones and
dead sea things.  About sixty feet down the hall it Tees.  We go to the left
and forty feet down the hall is a room.  There are a lart number of machines
in this room.  Ther are also large metal, plastic and glass containters.  The
machines appear to be made for human hands.  We turn around and go the other
way.  The corridor continues and turns left. We find storage corridors along
this tunnel about every fifty feet on alternating sides.  These storage
tunnels are 15' wide and tall and about 30' deep.  In the first one (on the
right side) we find more rusted machines.  The next to the left contains the
same.  The next one to the right contains statuary and statues.  It contains
a 200lb. beautiful blue stuatue of a Ssu.  Elaborate whorls are all over the
statue.  There are about 100+ statues on the floor. Most are of clear glass
and not realistic but impressionistic.  The next to the left contains a huge
door at the end about 15' by 15'.  We cannot get through.  Finally we reach
the end and about a 30' stairwell. At the end is a room that contains a
control box for tubeway cars.  And a tunnel for the tubeway cars.  We ignore
the controls.  In the dust around here are Ssu footprints.  There is another
exit to the left of where we go out.  there are long narrow steps going down
for what seems forever.  We go past sandstone, Linestone and Baslat rock
levels.  Finally the air begins to get bad and we can barely breath.  Luckily
the Avanthe Priest has a spell to help.  We get to the bottom and there is a
bronze door with nine glowing buttons on a 3 x 3 grid.  There are markings
but not in any language we understand.  We hear rumblings and it sounds
sentient.  We go all the way back and will come here as soon as we can.  At
this time we will need to come back with enough provisions to last a while.

The undergound may go on for quite some time.

Subject: Funerals

        Something everyone might want to look out for on the news on
March 10th, though it may not make it to US or UK screens is the funeral
and cremation of the King of Thailand's mother.
        As far as I can work out there are five huge processions, the
main one of which, accompanied by hundreds of monks complete with
chanting and clashing of temple gongs transfers the body to the funeral
pyre (an elaborate building in itself) on a huge gilded chariot in the
shape of a boat, with carved dragons etc., some 30' long and 20' high
pulled by teams of men. After the cremation the golden urn containing
the ashes is then transferred back to the Royal Temple on a similar
conveyance.
        It was truly incredible to see the amount of effort and expense
which has gone into the building of the pyre itself and the surrounding
buildings (all temporary) to do with the ceremony. They are also
relaying the roads and pavements along the processional route.
        The whole thing seemed to have a Tekumel sort of feel to it,
what with the huge chariot and everything.

Hi everyone.  It's annoucement time again.  I am sorry the list has been a
bit quiet recently, but I have been busy editing the Soucebook Volume 1.  I
am about 2/3rds of the way through it on paper, then I have to make the 
changes to the master document.  Lisa, Jack and Dermot, I'll try to process
your messages to the list later today.  I apologize for the delay.

I don't really read the newsgroup too much, as it is mostly spam and argue-
ments.  However, recently there has been a large ruckus about copyrights in
that forum.  I posted a message there hoping to clarify the situation, as 
publishing Tekumel material has a lot to do with me.  Here is a copy of the
message I posted to the newsgroup, hoping to clarify the copyright situation.
I am sorry to post this to the Blue Room, but I want everyone to be crystal
clear on the copyright issue.

Chris

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr. Barker's lawyer, Alan Musielewicz, asked that this be posted on his 
behalf.  He is apparently having some troubles posting from his account.

I post this only to clarify what the Professor and his lawyer feel about
the status of his copyrights.  Feel free to test their resolve on this 
issue at your own risk.

If you don't believe that I am relaying this message on the behalf of Mr.
Musielewicz, fine.  I really don't care...  You can contact him and pay 
for his legal opinion of the status of those copyrights.

Begin included statement.
-----------------------------------------------

I am Alan F. Musielewicz and I am an attorney licensed in the State of
Minnesota.  (State and Federal Courts)  Further, I am currently and have 
been Dr. Barker's attorney for five years. 

Four points:
(1) Dr. Barker's copyrights are intact.  Although they span over three
periods of copyright law, they are all valid and nothing has lapsed into 
the public domain.

(2) I really wish to know who was the attorney at the time of the Feist
publications.  There may have a breach of attorney/client privilege.   Feist
was rather clever and he changed Tekumel enough that a suit would have been
difficult, if not impossible to prove.  In any event, Dr. Barker's decision
not to pursue a nebulous claim does not constitute a waiver of his rights to
his copyrights as a whole.  Neither statutory law nor case law would support
that point.  

(3)  Dr. Barker is the only person who can give permission to make products,
novels, materials and the like based on Tekumel.  No one else has the right.
This is fair and public warning to all that I will vigorously pursue by
legal means any attempt by anyone to disregard Dr. Barker's rights regarding
Tekumel.  

(4)  Anyone who reads this, please do not waste my time responding.  I will
not answer correspondences on this matter. I do not wish to discuss this with
anyone that is not a Juris Doctor, or a paying client, as my time is valuable
and I am not here to give a basic course on copyright law.  My time is better
spent on suing offenders rather than dallying with words on line.

[Moderator's Note:  Lisa Leutheuser asks the following question on names.    ]

I have (I hope!) a simple request.  

I am looking for a list of Livyani first names, lineage names,
and clan names--including the relative status of the clan.  
(I'm assuming that different clans are found in Livyanu than 
in Tsolyanu, yes?)

[Moderator's Note:  I can't answer your specific questions, but some info on ]
[                   how clans are different in Livyanu as noted in the       ]
[                   Sourcebook.  Livyani clans are like those of Yan Kor,    ]
[        	    divided according to city-of-origin, but overshadowed    ]
[                   by the religious distinctions between the temples.  Each ]
[                   of the temples has member-clans, and those adhering to   ]
[                   one sect don't intermarry with others.  There are approx-]
[                   imately 700-900 clans in Livyanu.                        ]

I know in the Livyani language that male and female names have 
specific endings, but I only have one or two examples of male 
names.  (I can name the NPCs all the same thing, but I think 
that would be confusing for them and for those who much deal 
with them!  ;-)   )

My life would be made infinitely easier if there was already an 
existing list of names available in some source book that I don't 
know about or even a list available electronically on the WWW or 
on some ftp site.  Otherwise, if someone has some Livyani names 
and clannames they would't mind sharing, I would be much appreciative.

[Moderator's Note:  I don't know if anyone has such a compendium...  How 'bout]
[                   those of you lucky enough to play in Phil's campaign?  Do ]
[                   you guys have anything like this?  Do you have anything   ]
[                   Phil?                                                     ]

Also, if anyone has a "collected name book" for Tsolyani names 
that they are willing to share, I would like to see that as well.

Let me know if the Blueroom is not the right place for this kind 
of question, and I will re-post this to alt.games.frp.tekumel.

[Moderator's Note:  No, this is just the right spot for this question...      ]

Thank you,
Lisa Leutheuser

[Moderator's Note:  Jack Bramah offers some tails of the London Thursday night]
[                   campaigns.                                                ]

In sorting out the chaos of moving house I found some old diaries which
occasionally contained snippets of the then current Thursday night
London game. I'll try and piece them together in a coherent fashion
with background detail (what I can remember).

The players were (initially):
Myself  Chaideshu hiSsanmirin   Sea Blue Ka     Former hereksa in Serqu 
        Sword of the Empire. Also has a smattering of sorcery, only used 
        when otherwise unarmed.

Steve F Kanmi'yel hiBashlatoi Standing Stone Vi. Sorceror Priest. Hates
        Jadhak and Tlangten.

Jamie T Jadhak hiVriddi. Vriddi. Ct. Sorceror Priest of Chiteng. Enjoys 
        his work. Unable to keep money.

Min S   Tlangten hiSsanyusa. Standing Stone. Vi. Thrown out of Red 
        Devastation for being too psychotic. Hates Kanmi'yel

Rob D   Baluri hiThanu Sword of Fire. Vi. Arrogant. Hates Kanmi'yel (See 
        old issues of Imperial Courier for details of their extensive
        litigations)

Dave B  Emra hiGangasa. Might of Ganga. Be. Thin twin brother of 
        Yaliemra. Sorceror

Mark W  Yaliemra hi Gangasa. Might of Ganga. Qo. Se Above

Olly J  Ssomu hi???.???. ???. Strong warrior, not exceptionally endowed 
        with brains. Ally of Baluri

Dave M  Kashu hiVorodu. ??.Vi. Sorceror Priest. In with, if not actually  
        a member opf the Incandescent Blaze society

        7th Halir
        We went down into the tsu'urum into the Llyani levels, and found
all sorts of strange and useless devices of the Ancients. The flashing
lights looked pretty. We fought replicas of ourselves. I suspect that
means our old enemy Kolontal is back. We eventually discovered a
Learning Sphere which taught me Llyani Mathematics, though what
practical use that is I can't imagine. Ssomu didn't agree with the
division of the spoils and insulted the Clan. I demanded satisfaction in
the hirilakte. I won. When will my companions learn that I *always* win
in the arena when my honour is impugned?
        We left the arena to discover that there are other duplicates of
ourselves running around the town. Baluri's secretary has been murdered
and replaced by a simulacrum of some sort.


        16th Halir
        Entered a tomb of one of the Ssirandars and got ambushed by a
crowd of those backstabbers from the Ndalu Society. They left us alive,
but took everything else. Fortunately after that we found the main tomb,
and managed to re-equip ourselves. I found the amulet of the Good  God
I've been searching for all this time, and what appears to be the Hammer
of Pendarte. Unfortunately those cost me most of my share.

        17th Halir
        We have received a challenge from the cowards who ambushed us.
They wish to fight a fair contest between the two groups - winner takes
all. Everyone seems to be in favour, assuming that we can go down to the
combat ground in the underworld and set up a few safety devices as
contingencies against the treacherous behaviour they are bound to use.

        23rd Halir
        The Duel. We went down two days ago to set up focus points for
Departing in Safety. Who should  turn up for the duel but Kolontal - two
of him in fact, accompanied by two ru'un. Discretion was thought to be
the better part of valour, so we decided to use the Eye of Departing in
Safety. Unfortunately it left Emra and myself behind to face the two
ru'un (Kolontal went after the others). Emra was hit by the Excellent
Ruby Eye, which left me to face certain death at the hands of the
ancient automata. I sang my death song, and fired up a Blade of
Inexorable Disjection and went to my glorious death, sure of a place in
the Legions of the Lord of Battle. Fortunately one of them turned away
and headed after the others, and with the Scarlet Lord guiding my blade
I cut down the Bronze Demon.

[Moderator's Note:  Demot Bolton wonders about the extremes of worship on   ]
[                   Tekumel.                                                ]

After reading some of the excellent articles on the temples at the FTP 
site I began to think about worship.  How do people worship in Tekumel, 
and in particular what are the extremes of worship?

Of course there are some obvious examples, we've all seen the looney flame 
worshipper (or played one :)  ) fly into a raging orgy of destruction and 
mayhem.  And where would we be without the services of some of the more 
enthusiastic savants of the green eyed lady of fleshy joys?

But what of the other temples, can anyone give some examples of 
personalities they have encountered on their travels who can claim to be 
extreme devotees?

While we're on the subject what about everyday worship?  Players tend to 
play extreme characters generally and it is a good idea to give a 
'normal' view as well.  The peasant who lays a painted blue stone in the 
field, or the mild mannered Vriddi gent who light a candle at bedtime.

So lets hear about those fanatical Thumis chlen cart spotters and those 
boring nobles.

Subject: Re: Message 250: Clan/Lineage/First Names in Livyanu

I don't have a list of Livyani names, but you could easily supply a 
brief list by going into my Filemaker Pro database of character names 
and searching for "Livyanu" under "Nationality." This would pull up a 
good-sized list of nanes. 

[Moderator's Note:  I have tried to get lists of things out in the past      ]
[                   for people from the database.  Untill I learn a bit more ]
[                   about FM Pro, I can't get text to print out because of   ]
[                   the diacritical marks.  Last night I did go into the     ]
[                   database, and look for all the Livyani cities I knew of, ]
[                   and found all the entries, placed Livyanu in the city    ]
[                   field (along with the city name), so that the list would ]
[                   be easier to recreate.  There were 140+ people listed    ]
[                   with cities in Livyanu (some are expatriots).  I will see]
[                   what I can do to get them printed to Text files, or      ]
[                   people will just have to be satisfied with comma delim-  ]
[                   ited text.  The other option is a Postscript file.  I can]
[                   do postscript with no problem.  Please be a bit patient  ]
[                   while I fool around trying to make this  work.           ]

Most Livyani male names end in -z: (-az, -uz, -ez are common), and 
women's names end in -b (-eb or -ab are most frequent). Thus, Meluaz, 
Arvaz, Chorguz, Alitheb, Ekkuneb, Dailab, Nalueb, Mikonez and his 
sister Mikonab, etc. Lineage names do not use anything like the hi- 
the Tsolyani employ: thus e.g. Tarshaz Arrio Baghaz Khuer, Noldeb 
Tikkuna. The clan names are indeed different from those in Tsolyanu 
but are rather similar semantically: e.g. Gilded Wing, High Singing 
Bird, Mighty Blue-Green Wave.

[Moderator's Note:  There are also numerous clan names given in the 140      ]
[                   odd listing of Livyani characters.                       ]

May be Chris can work up a quick list from my database. ??? :) Wish 
there were a compendium! I'll also ask my players to chime in (no Ssu 
intended).

[Moderator's Note:  Working it up is quick, but getting it to print to a text]
[                   file is proving to be a bear.  Maybe I can just hand copy]
[                   the names, lineages, and clan names to a text doc.       ]
                                               
>Also, if anyone has a "collected name book" for Tsolyani names 
>that they are willing to share, I would like to see that as well.

Again, my character database is the place to look, but it requires 
Filemaker Pro, and it is not yet up on the FTP site in its entirety. 
I hope Chris can get to it one of these days soon.

I wish I had time myself to do up a list for you, but -- alas ...!

Phil

[Moderator's Note:  More of Jack Bramah's London Campaign notes...           ]

25th Halir
Thank you Ssirandar. Now I can afford a coming-of-age banquet for my 
son that Jakalla will remember for years to come.

26th Halir
I have been thinking about the guest list. I suppose I should invite 
the Governor, and I'll send a tentative invitation to Uncle Chaimira, 
though I doubt the pressures of his duties at Avanthar will allow him 
to be present. I'd better consult the Clan elders for the people that 
the Clan wants to invite. With any luck the fact that dress will be the 
16th Form might keep Tlangten and Ssomu away. Companions that they are 
I can't risk their lack of breeding reflecting badly on the Clan if 
they make some horrendous gaffe.

1st Trantor
The clanhouse is in complete chaos. Word has just been received that the 
High Provost of the Chancery will be in the province on official business 
next week, and he intends to honour us, and me with his presence at my 
son's banquet. This will really make it a night to remember!

4th Trantor
Three days to go. The High Provost is due tomorrow, and there will be a 
welcoming banquet in his honour. At least I shall get the chance to wear 
the 19th Form. In fact it will probably be required for my son's banquet 
too.

5th Trantor (late)
My head is in a spin. Perhaps I should not have indulged in that strange 
white paste after that much ngalu. I seem to be having very strange 
dreams. I have just seen a vision - it was this rather than a dream, 
since it felt so real, and I don't think I was asleep. I saw Kanmi'yel - 
or his soul at any rate, crossing over a black bridge to an island where 
Missum is standing at a lectern draped in yellow cloth, with a huge book 
perched in it, into which he is writing the names of other souls crossing 
the bridge. When Kanmi'yel reaches him he puts down the pen and does not 
write a name in the book. I wish I knew what that meant.

7th Trantor
More panic in the clanhouse. It seems that both Prince Rereshqala and 
the Princess Ma'in will be attending the banquet. This must surely be 
auspicious for my son. When has there been a naming banquet for someone 
not of the Tlakotani where two Imperial heirs are present? I must say 
that I was not this nervous when we were waiting for the order to scale 
the walls of Ke'er. It will be glorious if everything goes well this 
evening, but I will never be able to show my face in Jakalla again if 
anything goes wrong.

7th Trantor (later)
My son has chosen the name Tekutan. I hope that some of the spirit of 
that Tekutan hiSsanmirin who commanded the garrison of  Chene Ho in 
the War of 2020. 
     
Unbelievably both Tlangten and Ssomu attended and were models of respec-
table behaviour, not putting a foot wrong all evening.

The food was exquisite and the entertainments unsurpassed. Tekutan was 
bewitched by the Lady Zuara hiTlakotani, a niece of Rereshqala. I have 
heard that her tastes run to men of lower social background. One or two 
of the Noble Clans of Jakalla have had their noses put out of joint by 
being "requested" to induct commoners into their ranks.

[Moderator's Note:  Lisa asks for clarifaction on Livayni clans.             ]

One last thing, would it be possible to for you (or Barker, or anyone 
else) to pick out a few high/very high status Livyani clans that have 
good sized clan houses in Tsamra?  Then I will be completely set. :-)

Phil replies...
When I get the list, I'll try to do that -- but often it is just too 
difficult. Some clans are "high" in one city and "medium" or even 
"low" elsewhere. This is especially true of Livyanu, where local 
temples are the social arbiters and rulers, and where a clan belonging
to a highly regarded (and economically powerful) temple may be seen 
as higher than the same clan in another city. The ruling clan of 
Tsamra was the Gilded Wing -- until the Mu'ugalavyani invasion. Now 
it is still high because it is the clan of the puppet ruler (like the 
Vichy Government of Nazi-occupied France).

[Moderator's Note:  Bob Dushay asks about what vermin are on Tekumel.        ]

>What are some of the common vermin one might expect to encounter in

>this niche, or does some other creature fill this role?  Do cats serve 
>their ancient function of keeping down vermin, or is some other animal 
>(or spell) used instead?

In reply to Bob Dushay's question:

Rats were left behind when mankind went out to the stars. Thus, when 
Tekumel was first colonised, rodents were not brought along. A few earth 
insects, etc. did make it over the centuries, but these were either 
exterminated by local insect-like species, or else did not survive for 
other reasons.

Right now, there are a number of small species that do live in granaries 
and eat roots and fruits. Some of these are mammalian, others more like 
amphibians or insects. There is a squelchy little beast down in south-
western Tsolyanu that gets into storage bins and literally rots the
grain -- it turns black and liquid and smelly. It is called a Banye (with 
the usual noun ending: Banyekh, accent on the "e"). The Epeng, which is 
like a string of brownish beads is a serpent-like creature that lives in 
fruit storage areas -- and stings painfully. There are black and bright 
red Epengyal, too. A furry weasel-like creature that eats underground 
tubers and roots is the Meshoshikh (accent on the "o"). All of these are 
controllable but bothersome.

Cats and dogs do exist on Tekumel, and the cat is still used to control 
pests.  There is not a large variety of dog and cat sub-species, however: 
orange, black, and grey "tabbies," Siamese-like cats, etc. are the 
commonest. but others are occasionally found. Large hunting dogs, 
terriers, and a few other canine breeds are common as well.

Insect pests are common, as are rusts, moulds, and other plant diseases. 
These are often wiped out by equally virulent and hostile life-forms. 
Tekumel is a regular melting pot of species from many, many worlds, as 
you know. These have fought and competed, and now one finds that a sort
of balance is being struck.

>I have a few questions regarding Tsolyani clans and the impaling stakes 
>so many of us enjoy.

Dear Brendan.
I understand that your questions got answers from two other list-members. 
I doubt whether I can add much to what they have already said.

>Firstly, if you lose clan status and no longer belong to a clan, what 
>status do you now have in Tsolyanu? Are you still a citizen and can you 
>still travel the Sakbe Roads unescorted etc. Do the same laws that apply 
>for normal citizens apply to the clanless?

Expulsion from a clan is perhaps the greatest social sanction short of 
imprisonment, enslavement, or outright execution. The person loses all 
rights and has little or no legal recourse. His/her property is confis-
cated by the clan. He/she is still a free citizen and can travel the 
Sakbe Raads, but as a "Nakome" (Nah-co-MAY), he/she can be arrested, 
imprisoned, or killed with little compunction. Any contracts, marriages, 
etc. with such a clanless person are automatically dissolved (although 
a wife and children may elect to stay with the person). It is not some-
thing that can be taken lightly. In our world it is not uncommon for 
people to disown their families, run away to live on their own, marry 
"unsuitable" persons or just live together outside of society's stric-
tures, and generally thumb their noses at social rules, but in Tsolyanu
it is harder and more dangerous -- perhaps more like what such actions 
would have brought about in earlier, mediaeval times here. The clans 
are the governing force behind all of the institutions of Tsolyanu; it 
is not wise to cross them.

>A further point on this, an immigrant, especially non-humans will not 
>belong to a clan (correct?).  What rights do they get, how can they 
>become citizens and how could they join a clan?

If a nonhuman or immigrant is granted clan status, he/she/it receives 
FULL clan rights. To join a clan, one must be invited, usually as a 
result of some years of loyal service to that clan, plus friends who 
are already clan members, plus gifts of money or other goodies to the 
clan. Becoming a citizen is relatively easier: long term residence in 
Tsolyanu, service to the Empire, a clean record, plus a business or 
visible occupation, etc. are what the Palace of the Realm will look at 
when a foreigner comes to request the status of citizen. 

>The last question is that of impaling stakes.  How many impaled people 
>would you see on average if you entered a town and how long do they

Impalements are fairly common since many common felonies (larger thefts, 
burglary, rape, etc.) are capital offenses in Tsolyanu. There is usually 
a single site in each city where impaling stakes are erected on a regular 
basis. Executed felons remain on these stakes until they are taken down 
to make room for new victims, or until their bodies are removed by their 
relatives and friends (usually after several days, and always with the 
payment of bribes and fees to the Palace of the Realm. This is not one 
of the prettiest parts of Tsolyani life.

Phil answered this question while I was speaking with him tonight...  The
body is left on the stake (under guard, if need be), until it is impossible
for the revivification spell to work.  After which, the body is taken by 
the Prison Guards, to a corpse pit.  After the body is rendered not
re-animatable (is that a word?), it is dumped into the pit.  Some of these
pits in the larger cities are quite unpleasant, according to the Professor.
A great place to dump a player character, by mistake. :)

As I recall, Dhich'une's coup took place in the last Intercalary days 
of 2365. There was a short interregnum, and then Dhich'une held what 
he considered a Kolumejalim in early 2366. He then took the throne in 
early summer. The priesthood of Hnalla concurred (political machina-
tions?) and declared him Emperor, and he then took the ceremonial trip 
up the river to Avanthar and was taken into the Golden Tower. I think 
the whole process took no more than a week.

I cannot give you the exact dates right now -- all my materials are 
downstairs and would require some searching in order to dig them out. 
I have a terrible memory for dates anyway. As I have said, I see Tekumel 
in terms of pictures, colours, actions, and scenes -- not in terms of 
systems or abstracts. I failed rather spectacularly at mathematics and 
passed geometry and algebra only through the kind blandishments of good-
hearted teachers. Some of the players may thus recall more about dates 
than I do.

I can't recall off hand. Anybody?

The interregnum is indeed a time of nervous politicking. The previous 
Godking is said to rule (even though actually deceased) until his suc-
cessor formally enters the Golden Tower and appears behind the screen of 
the Petal Throne. In reality, this is a clearly understood fiction. This 
is often a time for unrest, for factions to arise and claim this or 
that -- and for the candidates for the Kolumejalim to gather support and 
march in procession to Bey Su, where the Kolumejalim is always held. 
Violence can and does occur, although traditional childhood training, and 
the rigid, formal, strictures of Tsolyani society prevent it from happen-
ing as often as one might expect here.

The network of telepaths does facilitate the spread of important news, 
although this method is rather uncertain and whimsical. One town in 
southeastern Tsolyanu (near Thraya) got the news of the death of 
Emperor Hirkane within a few hours, while Thraya itself did not get a 
telepathic message (or any other kind) for a couple of weeks after 
the event! (Remind anyone of the servers on the Internet?) Once 
received, the Palace of the Realm quickly spreads the news through 
public criers, written broadsides, announcements in the temples, and 
messengers to smaller towns and outlying settlements. All of this 
takes time. 

News is a slow and rather confused business. The telepathic networks 
often suffer from delays, interference, garbled messages, and other 
mix-ups. The Palace of the Realm is sometimes also unwilling to release 
news that may cause disruptions and unrest, and the politics of the 
situation thus must be sorted out first.

>Brendan Knox writes:
>AS a fairly new player to Tekumel, there are a few questions 

Bob Dushay's answers to the questions regarding clan are exactly right,
Brendan.  Getting kicked out of one's clan is something to be avoided at
all costs.  One way to look at how desperate your situation would be is to
think of clans as businesses for a moment.  If you got fired from your job
and had no family, you'd have your savings to live on.  AND none of the
other clans are "hiring"!  Even if it were easy to "get into" a clan (and
it's not -- in "Man of Gold" Harsan could only enter a clan under Imperial
order), who is a clan more likely to "hire":  an industrious nakome fellow
they've known for years, or some stranger who got fired from another clan?

In Barker's Thursday night campaign, Arumel hiChankolel was a very
respected member of the Sword of Fire clan.  Following Dhich'une's coup (I
can safely call it that on this plane, I think) he organized a rebel army
which swept from Jakalla to Thraya and Sokatis, up past Ferinara, across
the Desert of Sighs, past Sunraya and rescued Prince Mirusiya from
extra-planar seige in Tleku Miriya.

Yet a few years later he found himself in the Vimuhla city of Tumissa, on
the western end of the Empire.  Outside Tumissa is the "Temple in the
Chakas", actually an extra-planar stronghold with an entrance to our plane
in that vicinity.  The highest members of the Temple of Vimuhla are there,
and one of them ordered Arumel, in the name of the Temple and the God
Himself, to carry out a mission against the Demon Gereshma'a which would
have resulted in Arumel's almost-certain destruction.

Arumel refused.  He was promptly kicked out of his clan and temple, and
had to beg favors from those of us in the party.  He died only a matter of
weeks later, ambushed by those whom he had offended in the past, who knew
that no one would seek vengeance for his death.

THAT is what it means to get kicked out of your clan.

>>Another question, this time about implaing stakes.  How long 
>>do you think an impaled party stays impaled after death 
>>(the "showing off" time) and how many imapled offenders do you 
>>think you'd see upon entering your average city in Tsolyanu?

>An excellent question, and I don't know.  The sourcebook says that the roads

>the stake is needed for somebody else.

The amount of time your body spends on display will depend on several
factors.  First is your clan, as always -- if they could not save you from
the stake, they will possibly (depending on the nature of your offense)
try to save you (and themselves) from the indignity of having a clanmember
so treated.  If you committed a particularly offensive crime your clan
will disown you of course, and this won't be a factor. 

Another factor is a sense of the times.  If there has been some sort of
larger disturbance, of which your offense is a part, you and your
partners-in-crime may remain on display for quite some time to dissuade
others from such actions.  As Bob points out, if they run out of stakes
you might be taken down early...or they might put up more stakes!

There are religious considerations.  If your offense was somehow
worthy-of-impalement-but-not-so-bad (and what that is I don't know), you
might be granted the dignity of a religious interrment after you died. 
This isn't so likely -- such an offense would have to get you killed but
retain some of your dignity.  Further consideration must be given to the
protocols of the Mrek who oversaw your impalement -- the four-person team
described in Flamesong which must oversee all "official" impalement. 
Their protocols are particular and arcane -- you might be left up or taken
down according to the phases of the moons and planets, according to their
ancient traditions.

Finally, the imperial officers of the area can simply say "Psha!  That
thing STINKS!  Take it down and throw it on the garbage heap!"  I
particularly ignominious ending.

I've only been impaled a couple of times, and it hurt.  Each time my
friends managed to either get me off the stake or hack off an arm and use
an Eye of Revivification on it.

[Note from Bob:  subsequent discussion asked what the Empire would 
think of an executed criminal being revivified.  I should make it 
clear that both times that Arjai was impaled were when he was OUTSIDE 
Tsolyanu proper.  Each time he was visiting another plane and was 
all-too-happy to 'get outta Dodge' right after being revivified.  Each 
time he was rescued by "the party" who left with him.  The 
consequences of pulling such a stunt and then hanging around would 
have been unpleasant.]

There is nothing dignified or pleasant about it, and it hurts.  
Especially if they don't sand down the sides ofthe stake (splinters in 
your spleen!) or if they don't sharpen the tip(not advised, as the tip 
is more easily deflected to emerge from below the ribcage rather than 
tip-first through the open mouth, the mark of the best impalements).  
Lubricated, smooth, sharpened stakes are the quickest and the 
least-likely to be botched.

I hope I can correct your perception of the Tsolyani.  They are NOT, by
and large, possessed of "inherent bloodlust", nor of the opinion that
"being alive is a crime."

The legal system in the Empire is strict, but it is not Pol Pot. 
Punishment is harsh, but it is only meted out when warranted.  If Tsolyani
citizens, even nakome, feared for their lives upon stepping out into the
street, commerce and industry could not be maintained.

The reason Tsolyanu may LOOK "bloodthirsty" at first glance is probably
because the nature of role-playing games is to place characters into
"nonconforming" situations.  Few people enjoy role-playing peasants,
administrators or guards going about their daily routine (well, few people
do -- we actually tried it for a while and it was a refreshing change from
saving the world).  Bickering about where to dig the latrines, who should
dig them, and whether they should be close to the river or farther up the
hill simply doesn't make for fun gaming.

So players tend to be engage in questionable, if not outright illegal
activities.  In Tsolyanu raiding a tomb is highly illegal, and will in
addition annoy the tomb-robbing clans, the tomb guards (whose bribes from
the tomb-robbing clans will be interrupted if the tombs are disturbed by
outsiders), and the posterty of those in the tombs.  But how many basic
Tsolyani adventures are set in the Underworld?  A lot!

Another factor in this perception is "place".  The Tsolyani expect people
to perform their roles, and frown upon nonconformity.  But what is the
adventurer but a nonconformist?  You're supposed to join the clan
business, marry the girl-next-door, and produce little ones who scurry
about the clanhouse -- what are you doing wandering around in those grimy
tsuru'um with a bunch of ignoble scum from other temples!?

So the adventurer in Tsolyanu is automatically in conflict with the whole
society.  If you disagree with society long enough you will be at first
urged to cease your conflicting activities, then punished, and finally
done away with if your nonconformity persists.

But, really, the "average Tsolyani" is just as peaceable and kindly as you
or I. 
The average Tsolyani is perfectly happy to marry the girls or boys next
door, to fulfill their role in the clan or temple, to seek acceptable
measures of gain and advancement which bring respect and reward, and to
avoid the attention of the Imperial legal system.

For contrast, look around you.  Our "adventurers" rob banks, or run drugs,
or slay people who have insulted their honor -- we call them criminals. 
After three drug offenses we imprison them forever.  However, if they slay
someone, we release them in about seven or eight years as long as they can
show the least provocation.  A Tsolyani would think our system arbitrary
and insane, and would find our madness confirmed in the crime which
riddles our cities.  Are we "bloodthirsty"?  How many people will die to
violence on fictional TV programs tonight?  Is it a crime to be alive? 
How many poor, minorities, or immigrants are hassled, harassed, illegally
arrested or imprisoned?  If our minority population can be considered
"nakome" for a moment, what is their ratio of rates of imprisonment?

No, from the point-of-view of the "average Tsolyani" life is about doing
your job, pleasing your friends, family and bosses, looking forwards to
the spring celebrations and the autumn harvests, and trying to enjoy your
brief stay upon the planet.  And in many ways their society is more sane
and stable then our own.  Or do you really think the Western way-of-life
is going to be largely the same as it is now in the year 21996?

[Moderator's Note:  Bob Crane asks about Dhich'une and the temple of Sarku   ]
[                   in regards to issues about the undead.                   ]

The statement is correct as given. Most citizens of the Five empires 
would be strongly against open power wielded by one or the Undead. Since 
most of the inhabitants of these nations are "alive" (as opposed to 
"Undead"), any open attempt to rule by the latter would lead to great 
social unrest, desertions from the armies, etc. The Temples of Sarku and 
Durritlamish thus treat the Undead as "adepts" (revered, holy beings), 
and do not permit them to rule. There is also, apparently, a loss of 
interest on the part of the Undead in temporal power: after all, what 
good are money, sex, physical prowess, property, etc. to the Undead? As 
long as Sarku's religious objectives are achieved, the Undead seem 
content (if that is the right word) to act as mentors, advisors, sages, 
etc. and dwell in the darkened depths of their sect's greatest temples. 

I should note that the Undead are less common in "real" Tekumel than in 
the games based on it. Creating an Undead being takes considerable time, 
expertise, and sorcerous hard work. The lowly Shedra are the commonest, 
but these are merely animated liches. Most worshippers of the Worm Lord 
would not want their loved ones turned into Mrur under any circumstances. 
A few -- mostly guardians for Underworld areas and tombs -- are indeed 
created every year; others dry up, wither, and fall to dust after some 
time unless renewed by sorcery, and this, too, is a lengthy process. The 
next variety, the Shedra, is somewhat more intelligent, able to think 
for itself somewhat, and make a limited numer of functional choices. 
Again, the Shedra are rare, limited to the Underworlds, and really cannot 
appear in polite society! The highest category, the Jajgi, actually comes 
in many forms and varieties, ranging from semi-intelligent (but clearly 
deceased!) to the rarest of all, the Undead who can function as a normal
living being. A Jajgi of this calibre can take part in society but cannot 
procreate. These tend to be the highest adepts of the Temples of Sarku 
and Durritlamish; they are scholars, sorcerers, and teachers of the Way 
of the Sepulchre, the Inner Doctrine of the faith. (And don't ask me, 
please, to define the "Way": not being Undead myself, I do not know it.)

Emperor Dhich'une is ASSUMED by many to be a Jajgi. He may also be a 
living being, but imbued with one of the Aspects of his dread Lord. 
"Putting an Aspect" upon a living person is a power the Gods seem to 
have. I recall another Aspect of Lord Sarku, called Siyenagga, that was 
vouchsafed to a human priest of his temple. There was also the case of 
an Aspect of Lord Vimuhla, named Purukasai "the Burner of Cities," that 
was given to a human warrior. Other cases are cited in the temple records.

If Emperor Dhich'une is actually a Jajgi, he must have gone on to attain 
still higher powers than most of his Undead colleagues ever managed to 
acquire. Previous Sarku-worshipping Emperors have existed in Tsolyani 
history, but these seem to have been living beings (well... we think 
so...). If Dhich'une is indeed one of the Undead, he must have retained 
the human qualities of ambition, greed, and a need for power -- very 
unusual for any Jajgi and rather contrary to Lord Sarku's teachings -- 
and this would make him a very long-"lived" ruler, indeed!  Tsolyani 
society would certainly refuse to follow him, if this were proved to be 
the case, and his Undead troops (who cannot be numerous and must be only 
a small bodyguard or cohort of personal servitors) would not be able to 
save him from his unwilling subjects!

Hypothetically, an Undead Jajgi Emperor would cetainly be able to last 
for hundreds of years, but people would notice, and his supporters would 
drop away. It is even considered "not cricket" to employ spells or 
magical devices of revivification upon an Emperor. These are rare in 
"real Tekumel" terms, and people tend to shy away from someone who has 
been "dead" and embarked upon the long voyage to the Isles of Teretane. 
It just "ain't normal." 

Most Tsolyani prefer their colleagues, rulers, etc. to be "alive," just 
as we do here, and all the Undead soldiers on Tekumel cannot make one's 
subjects love and serve such a ruler. This is almost certainly one of 
the problems Dhich'une is having -- and will continue to have -- in 
ruling the Empire: people suspect he is missing a few crucial parts 
(like blood that flows?), and thus Eselne, Rereshqala, Mirusiya, or even 
newly-revealed Taksuru seem better to the average folks than he does.

In the game, of course, revivification is almost absolutely necessary 
in order to avoid rolling up new characters at every step. Most of our 
players have been "returned to life magically" more than once. In "real 
Tekumel" terms, this would be very difficult, very expensive, and would 
create a number of social problems for the reviv-ee and his/her comrades.

The implication is that Lord Asqar is one of three memers in his cell. 
This is the smallest cell of the Livyani Vru'uneb. It is common for 
this paranoid society to have large cells (20-40 -- and more members), 
and have several of the cells interlocking with "secret" members in 
every cell who are also members of other cells and watchers upon 
watchers... Sounds like our increasing lack of personal security on 
the Internet and in our own society these days? Brrr.

>Do people have separate houses, nobility etc.? Otherwise I would

Usenanu has several hostels for foreign or out-of-city travellers. I
mentioned only the BEST hostels in the Sourcebook. Most people do 
live in clanhouses, and every clan tries to have a house in every 
large city -- and also in as many of the smaller towns as possible. 
Rather like fraternities that have chapters at different American 
universities.

Clanhouses differ from place to place: in Khirgar, they are tall and 
narrow because Old Khirgar is a small, walled enclave. In Urmish and 
Katalal, clanhouses are larger, more open, with gardens and parks, 
courtyards for trade and crafts, stables for Chlen-beasts, pens for 
Hma and Hmelu, servant quarters, slave quarters, and facilities such 
as kitchens, pantries, wine cellars, scriptoria, ecord-rooms, refec-
tories for dining, etc. When you visit a clanhouse in one of these 
"open" regions, you first come to a solid wall all around the place, 
with a high gate emblazoned with the clan's symbols. Inside, there is 
an open court for "parking" of palanquins, where slaves and escorts 
can sit and wait under shaded colonnades, with food and drink, foun-
tains, etc., and more gates that lead off to other courts where stores 
are kept, where crafts are created, where the clan transacts its usual 
business(es), etc. Going on into the main house, you find an atrium 
where chamberlains come up and ask whom you wish to see. Halls lead 
off toward guest rooms, family rooms for individual lineages and 
family quarters, and to the public areas: feasting halls (closed most 
of the time unless there is a party), council rooms, trophy rooms 
(where ancient standards, awards, documents, etc. are kept for the 
edification of young clansmen), and the like. Every clanhouse is 
differently organised and arranged.

There are also private houses outside of the clanhouses. Some families 
and lineages prefer to live by themselves, and so cities also contain 
sections where personal homes can be purchased. These are smaller 
versions of the clanhouses, with little courtyards, atria, bedrooms, 
guestrooms, etc. -- as much and as fancy as the owner can manage.

Slums are also common: small flats of two or three rooms, with cooking 
facilities in one room, sleeping quarters for as many as a dozen men, 
women, and children in another, and a sort of "common room" for guests 
and general meeting and greeting. Many slums contain still smaller and 
meaner quarters: barely hovels, people sleeping on the landings of 
staircases in ancient, dilapidated, stinking buildings, holes made by 
pulling bricks out of an ancient city wall, or just ragged awnings 
spread over a crevice in a building on the street. These are not nice 
places. Dirt, starvation, disease, and ugliness are the rule here, and 
every year the Imperium (and similar agencies in other countries) make 
efforts to clean them up, move the inhabitants out, find them jobs, and 
help. These efforts are haphazard and never very effective, unfor-
tunately, and so nearly every year one sees food riots in the great 
cities. I think Lord Tekunu described one of these that he witnessed in 
Jakalla. Bey Su is worse, and troops are sometimes brought in to quell 
such disturbances.

Tekumelani cities are very complex, sociologically. I hope that we will 
be able to get out a city book one of these days, but no book can give 
the actual feel of one of these places: the opulence and wealth on the 
one hand, and the abject unbearable poverty on the other. Beauty and 
elegance are all around, but there are also ugliness and congestion 
and decay.

[Moderator's Note:  In checking through some events, Bob Alberti found a    ]
[                   transcription of the challenge issued by Taksuru in the ]
[                   Professor's Thursday night game.                        ]

Here's the challenge issued to Emperor Dhich'une by a representative 
of Prince Taksuru Tlakotani on the 23rd of Dohala, 2366, recently 
unearthed in my notes.

-----

"Mighty Emperor, He Whose Every Word is That of the Gods, Eternal 
Splendor,

"I bring word from the Council of Priesthoods of the Empire of 
Tsolyanu, the Seal Which Rules Forever in Glory, that a challenge is 
issued by a Prince of the Empire and duly considered by the Council of 
the Priesthoods, to the Rule of the Emperor and the Legitimacy of the 
Kolumejalim, the Rite of Choosing Emperors.

"In accordance with the laws of Empire set forth by the mighty Emperor 
Trakonel the First, "The Blazing Light", may the God-Emperor please, 
you are implored to respond to this challenge, in the manner set forth 
by Emperor Trakonel, to vouchsafe the security of the Empire and the 
Glory of the Petal Throne.

"The Council of Priesthoods declares therefore a conclave of the 
Priesthoods to be met in one week, on the last day of Dohala, at which 
time the Council will be honored to receive the Emperor's 
representatives to answer the challenge brought before the Council.

"This the Council of the Priesthoods implores upon the pleasure of the 
Mighty Gods and the Emperor whose Splendor is Eternal."

----

Fortunately for the messenger, the Emperor was not present when this 
challenge was issued.  Unfortuately for the Emperor, the challenge was 
delivered to distract attention from an invasion of the Golden Tower, 
led by Prince Mridobu and the Baron Ald, via secret ways known only to 
Mridobu.  Upon entering the Golden Tower and finding the Emperor gone 
(Dhich'une was in the City of Sarku celebrating important religious 
rites) Mridobu seized the throne using the name "Risen to Rule".  His 
rulership was extremely brief, however:  returning to Avanthar mere 
days later, Dhich'une's Undead swarmed over everything in sight.  

[Moderator's Note:  So, Bob, what you are saying is that Taksuru and Mridobu ]
[                   were in league on this?  Or did Mridobu just slink in on ]
[                   the party's coat-tails?  If Mridobu was going to rule, I ]
[                   wonder what Taksuru was going to get out of the deal?    ]

Witnesses from the village of Avanthar (located on the river beside 
the cliff-hewn fortress) claim to have heard shrieks of "They're 
coming out of the walls!" and seen Mridobu's supporters hurled to 
their deaths from every window of the tower.

Mridobu himself disappeared and has not thereafter been seen.  But 
he's done this before...

[Moderator's Note:  Jack's transcript continues.  This is part 3 and part 4, ]
[                   as they came within a few hours of one another.          ]

Part 3

10th Trantor
Kanmi'yel is dead again, or so it seems. Jadhak and I have
our doubts. 

A N'lyss called Mruft Sroso tried to kill Jadhak today,
apparently under the influence of Domination. Strangely the
assailant's left eye is clouding over a bit like Kanmi'yel's did
after the incident with Nyelmu and the sra'ur of Lelmiyani.

11th Trantor
Kanmi'yel, it seems, immolated himself in the Sacrificial
Flame at the Temple of Vimuhla. Why he should choose this
particularly devout form of suicide is a mystery to me, as he has
never been that fervently religious.

12th Trantor
I overheard Jadhak talking to Tlangten - *He* killed him,
or at least had him killed by some of his hired thugs. He
dominated him and then had him killed at Kashu's house. Jadhak
is now really worried, because he had a Transmogrification cast
to try and contact Kanmi'yel's spirit. He failed to find it
either in the Unending Grey or on the way to the Isles of the
Excellent Dead. That menas that either he's still alive or in the
Halls of Burning Victory (or whatever the Flame paradise is
called).

13th Trantor
We now think that Kanmi'yel's soul is inhabiting the body
of Mruft Sroso, who we have recently found out was employed by
Kolontal. I can't believe that Kanmi'yel would have anything
voluntarily to do with our arch-enemy. Jadhak is now working out
a way of killing Kanmi'yel off permanently. Personally I don't
care as long as a corollary is the death of Kolontal. He's one
thorn in my side I could well do without.

17th Trantor
I don't know what happened to Jadhak's plan, but Kanmi'yel
is back looking like himself again, and we're heading north to
try and thwart the plans of the vile traitor Baron Ald.

---------------------------------------------------
Part 4

1st Hasanpor
Because of Jadhak's dithering in Purdimal about buying some
weird ingredients for one of his bizarre rituals we almost got stranded
in the middle of nowhere for the intercalary days. We travelled non-stop
for the last two days. It cost us a fortune in palanquins and bearers.
The rest of us have persuaded Jadhak to cough up for it as it was his
fault. Not that it's his money anyway - he's borrowing off me again, or
at least borrowing off my funds which are managed by the major-domo. I
understand that Ma'ashte made him put the Palace of the Moon up as
security against the loan. One part of me would be quite keen for him to
default on the loan, as the Palace is worth ten times as much as the
loan, but I'm not sure I'd want it, given the strange goings-on that
always seem to occur there. Probably something to do with the fact that
there used to be a Pariah temple underneath. There's probably a
lingering taint even if it has been completely filled in and purged by
all the relevant priesthoods.

Anyway we made it to Khirgar in time for the intercalary days.
Not exactly my favourite place in the Empire, but still better than some
village in a field. The city is teeming with troops. Tlangten has found
some of his old legion buddies, so he's off remembering old times with
them.

2nd Hasanpor
I bumped into Sergeant Heshqo this morning. He used to be my
senior NCO. He was invalided out after losing his right hand in a
Qadarni. At least he isn't reduced to beggary, as he seems to have held
on to quite a lot of the loot we got from Ke'er. It can't be much fun
though for a soldier who knows nothing else, but can't fight.

4th Hasanpor
We've received some sort of orders. I'm not sure quite where
they come from, but Kashu and Jadhak seem to be the most informed, so I
suspect there may be a hint of Incandescent Blaze somewhere. 

We're to find some sort of secret Yan Koryani fortress to the
north of the Atkolel Heights, and find out what's going on there.

15th Hasanpor
We've been struggling through a swamp for the last couple of
days, beset by the usual denizens - Tsoggu etc. 

Razhim turned out to be some sort of automaton, no doubt sent by
Kolontal, who cut down Baluri and Tlangten before we could stop him.

16th Hasanpor
We arrived at the "fortress" and discovered two black pyramids
covered in glyphs of Tkel. It's a good job we had Jadhak with us, who
got us past using the correct formulae of dismissal. 

The place is something to do with the Weapon Without Answer, and
we found Fu Shi'i, who we killed by setting light to him - or so we
thought. No sooner had we turned our backs when he was up again and sent
eaters of Souls at us, which kept us busy while he made good his escape.

18th Hasanpor
The archaeologists will have fun in the centuries to come when
they find the wreckage of a ship atop a mountain in the Atkolel Heights.
A ship with a lot of Yan Koryani bodies underneath it.

I'll explain: we were using Aeriality to speed our journey back
to Khirgar when we came across a unit of the Legion of the Dancer
Without Eyes being attacked by a larger force of Yan Koryani. Our
sorcerers had expended most of their energies so the only recourse to
rescue these gallant troops was to improvise by withdrawing our merchant
ship from within the Chest of the Topaz God and allowing it to fall on
the attackers. What a waste of a ship. Still, we should appear in a few
Ahoggya legends soon.

[Moderator's Note:  Bob Alberti, who is writing the forthcoming Mitlanyal,   ]
[                   asks a question of everyone in the group...              ]
[Quick Note:  Things are wrapping up for the quarter here, so the list will  ]

[             messages on Sunday.                                            ]

I don't know why I didn't think of this earlier, but then again I'm 
pretty thick sometimes.

One of my niggling concerns when writing Mitlanyal has been that it 
will not meet the audience's expectations.  Of course, I realize that 
it CANNOT meet EVERYBODY'S expectations, and additionally that 
WHATEVER I publish will be roundly flamed by those who choose to use 
alt.games.frp.tekumel for something other than grammar-related spams.
There's just no pleasing SOME people.

I gave the first rough draft of the Pariah Deities section to 
Professor Barker last evening and am starting on the Tsolyani section 
(having 'warmed up' on the smaller PD chapter).  Unless he makes any 
drastic changes or requests additional info be added, this will be the 
first section actually FINISHED.

Hence it has triggered in me the anxiety present in any writer -- is 
anyone going to LIKE it?

So I figure what the heck, before I engrave any of this in stone, I'll 
ask...

What do YOU want to see in Mitlanyal?  What do you EXPECT to see in 
Mitlanyal?

The following are parts of a reply from Professor Barker regards some 
clarifications to my last post to the Blue Room about Vru'uneb Cell 
Structures and also a side note about some fungus I had turn up in a 
game of mine.

Q: When you say the cell contains three people, how many cells of this 
type are there? Is it a heriarchy (spelling?), ie. only one cell of 3, 
one of 4, one of 5, down to one cell of 40 people or are there usually 
a few cells of three, etc.  

Phil: It is said that there is only one cell with just 3 in it: the 
one to which Lord Asqar belongs, plus two others whose names are not 
revealed. There are proably several cells with four, more with five, 
etc., up to the largest and commonest -- the Vru'uneb's "foot-soldiers". 
These last may number 40 members or even more. Nobody knows.

Q: I also ran my first game a few weeks ago (of Gardisiyal that is), 
and I had two keen hobbyists of the Tsu'urum investigate some old 
ruins that are fairly well known.  However, they fell through a 
weakened floor and into some new levels, down into some type of 
fungus.  I called it Humetl fungus (the accent over the "u"). It 
caused slight amnesia, they didn't know how they had come to this 
place, and only remember leaving Thra'ya. Would this be a type 
fungus that might have adapted on Te'kumel? A kind of defense 
(apart from growing in the Tsu'urum!). 

Phil: The Humetl fungus is well known. Another and more common name 
for it is Maralakh, accent on the 3rd "a". Your name for it is per-
fectly good, however.  The word Humetl is related to Humal-ikh," 
which denotes wineskin or waterskin; this is because of the bloated 
shape of the fungus. 

Many thanks for your answers Phil!

Quick Note: The fungus' amnesia was very slight, a few hours loss 
I think, and it only lasted for another hour or so (can't remember 
the Tekumel time units!!) Not much more is known, I can't seem to 
remember! Just enough to make a possible eater of the fungus (who 
would!!) forget the reason they were there!?  Who really knows?

Yours in Flames,
Brendan

Subject: Responses so far (ridiculously long)

Here is a summary of some of the concerns and responses so far.  I am 
digesting the questions into summaries for two reasons.  First, 
since responses have come in private mail its not really kosher to 
forward them to the list intact (although I don't really think the 
authors would mind in most cases), but second and more importantly 
because several people have made the same point in different messages, 
indicating a generalized concern.

Please continue to write with your ideas and comments.  They are quite 
helpful.  Last evening Professor Barker and I addressed many of these 
items to make sure they were covered, so they do have impact.  And 
thank you to EVERYONE for going to the trouble to write and help out, 
it's much appreciated.

<As in Growing Up in Tekumel, it should have a story and be not merely 
a sourcebook>

That was my original plan 'way back when I started, but the thing is 
already too damned big.  My original idea involved a 'travelogue' 
story where a protagonist's adventures brought her into contact with 
each of the different Tsolyani temples.  Unfortunately the more I 
worked with Tekumel the more interwoven the faiths in different 
nations became, to where simply cutting out the Tsolyani gods would 
leave ragged edges all over the place.  Additionally I've read these 
travelogue stories by other, much better authors than myself 
(Silverberg had one about some huge mucking planet whose name I can't 
recall) and the whole thing came out very forced.

<Wants more Pariah Deity and Pavar aspect information, wouldn't mind 
an organized compendium of pre-existing material>

This you'll get.  There are aspects to this project that I suspect 
many critics of my slow productivity simply aren't grasping.  First is 
that by-and-large I'm not making any of this up.  I've had several 
people offer to write "background material" or "filler" on various 
parts of Tekumel, but that's not what I need.  What I need is a 
currycomb and a lot of time.  Professor Barker is a prolific 
storyteller, but that's just what he does -- tell stories.  It is not 
his style (nor should it be) to expound for great lengths of time upon 
a single subject or in a single area.  Instead he follows the story of 
what he is telling, and if that means means his discussion ranges 
wildly across the field, then its my job to scurry along behind him 
picking up his...  no, wait, this metaphor is going entirely the wrong 
way!

The point is that it's very easy for him to drop phrases such as "with 
the exception of the War Temples and Sarku, most temples give over 
their dead to Belkhanu's priests for burial", and what does that do to 
me?  I have to run through EVERY TEMPLE, add this information in as 
a Death Ritual of the Outer Doctrines, and then balance it against 
information from each specific temple.  For instance in the temple of 
Avanthe, corpses are buried with their hands at their sides, but 
Hnalla and Thumis bury their dead with their hands crossed over their 
stomachs.  (Remember, I'm not making any of this up.)

That being the case is it necessary for me to examine WHY these bodies 
are buried in different positions?  Must I explain that Belkhanu's 
people see to the arrangement of the limbs as part of their duties?  
And then again, why DON'T Vimuhla and Chiteng employ Belkhanu's 
services?

So every phrase that the Professor drops is a potential information 
landmine, waiting to explode with facts flying in all directions.

Add to this the fact the he is quite prolific and has written a lot of 
stuff (much of it never published), and maybe one starts to grasp the 
magnitude of the problem of categorizing and organizing his works.

So to return to the main point, yes -- a compendium of pre-existing 
material alone would be worth the effort and worth the purchase.  If 
done right.

<More on the everyday worship of deities>

You'll get a good bit of this, I think.  Phil and I have made an 
effort to ensure that examples of worship within each of the temples 
are given.

<Concerns about how "real Tsolyani" worship, and how such specialized
gods can support entire cultures within the nation.> 

This will be touched upon, but I've discussed it before, too.  The 
key point to keep in mind is that people are people, even a 
quarter-million years from now on Tekumel.  Hence most people worship 
simply because that's what their parents did, with little more 
consideration of it than we give.  Why do Americans go to church on 
Sunday or temple on Saturday?  Why can the same people sin and make 
hypocrites of themselves every single day?  Because their faith is 
customary and shallow.

Likewise, how does a Vimuhla worshipper refrain from burning down the 
neighborhood?  How can ANYONE worship Dra?  Custom and shallowness.  

"Yes I worship Vimuhla, in fact my brother's a second-circle cantor in 
the temple.  It's a good job and he likes the people he works with.  
His proctor is a pleasant fellow and there's this really cute tenturen 
player from the temple of Hru'u who comes in and gives lessons to the 
children.  My brother says he'll introduce me sometime, but my job 
doesn't leave me a lot of time to attend temple ceremonies."

Just average joes working from day to day, whether in Bey Su or the 
Kraa Hills.

<Its hard to square gods that seem "evil" or extreme against the fact 
that they support everyday people and cultures>

Yes, that's right.  In fact, none of them are "evil", with 
the possible exception of the Pariah Deities.  Mitlanyal will strive 
to make clear that each god, however "icky" they may seem to us 
Westerners, fulfills a societal role and supports society... even 
Chiteng!

<It would be good to be able to understand why certain regions and 
people would worship Ksarul or Sarku, what the average Tsolyani "gets" 
out of their worship>

Yes, this will be addressed.  For instance, Ksarul and Thumis 
have the best schools, and each temple operates vast areas of 
cropland.  What do you get from worshipping Hru'u?  What do you get 
from working at Honeywell?  What do you get from volunteering at your 
church?  You do get stuff -- whether it's money, prestige, power, or 
simply the company of friendly people of like beliefs.

<Does NOT want game mechanics in Mitlanyal>

Good.  I'm not a rules-lawyer, and as has been mentioned here many 
times, we don't actually USE rules at Professor Barker's Thursday 
night game.  I believe Keith Dalluhn has posted our "rules" a couple 
of times.  Fig Newtons figure more prominently than dice in these 
rules.

<Prefers partial lists of the Aspect to comprehensive lists, leaving 
room for variation and creativity)

That's just what you'll get.  The REAL, COMPREHENSIVE list of Aspects 
varies from temple to temple and time to time, as is explained in 
Mitlanyal (in sections already written).  The Aspects of the gods are 
understood exactly as clearly as the Saints of the Catholic Church -- 
and who of you out there can claim to know all of them, or that 
everyone agrees on their significance and role?

<Would prefer some examples of specifics within the temples, rather 
than a painstaking explanation of every detail in every temple>

That's just what you'll get

<Does not want "high-falutin'" magical theories or Planar analyses 
which would be irrelevant to the average Tsolyani>

Well, you WILL get SOME of the "high-falutin'" stuff, seeing as many 
PLAYERS are interested in it, even if as you point out very few 
TSOLYANI ever encounter any of it.

<Counsels avoiding trying to incorporate changes which may have been 
caused by the civil war and which are not yet settled>

Except where it impacts social and theological celebrations, this is 
not a factor.  The celebration of the Acension of the Seal Emperor, 
for instance, has not been formally celebrated since Dhich'une took 
the throne because he's been too busy keeping the lids on all his 
pots.  However, Tsolyani being who they are, many places still 
celebrate Hirkane's Acension out of habit and a love of celebration.  
Aside from these kinds of factors, worship in the temples remains 
unaffected by the civil war.

<Would like to see the Livyani Shadow Gods, but suggests separate 
books might be necessary to cover everything>

As many theologies as I can fit will all be touched upon, if briefly.  

Probably the most legitimate criticism of my slow pace of progress has 
been that I am trying to cover too much ground.  My only explanations 
regarding this decision are these two:  first, this is how I do 
things, and how I, personally, learn.  I need to understand the whole 
of a subject and I'm very poor in leaving grey areas where I simply 
accept my ignorance and work around it.  The reason I'm so good with 
computers, for instance, is that I understand them from an electrical 
point-of-view up to the structure of very high-level languages.  On 
the other hand the reason I never graduated from college was because 
it was very hard for me to learn calculus:  to pass the five required 
courses took me twelve years and about fifteen total classes.  This is 
not because I'm stupid, per se, but because I learn poorly by formula 
and rote.  I had to understand, for instance, that in an equation 
featuring "R-squared", one "R" meant the radius along the X-axis, and 
the other R meant the radius along the Y-axis, and exactly how they 
interrelated:  the X-axis R pushed the spinning Y-axis R along its 
length, the length of Y varied according to the equation across X.  
The whole thing represented one way to describe the volume.  Once I 
understood that I could understand the mathematics, but I could NOT 
learn it by rote.

If this sounds like an elaborate excuse, I can only say it is not.  It 
is what I learned about myself after attempting to overcome the 
particular challenge of college and calculus.  Where it pertains to 
Mitlanyal is that I needed to see the WHOLE PICTURE before I could 
grasp the various gods.  I needed to understand the relationship 
between the Fungus-Eaters of M'morcha and the Dragon Warriors of the 
Nluss before I could comfortably say that I knew anything about either 
of them.

The second reason for the slow pace of this book is simply that these 
religions ARE deeply interrelated.  It's very hard to do a good job 
while leaving out these interrelationships.  It's like trying to 
explain stew buy just letting someone taste a potato.  The subject 
really called for a comprehensive examination.

<It's hard to say what I want without knowing what is being offered:  
what is the book like now?>

The organization of the book is roughly this:

  60% Tsolyanu
  20% The rest of Humanity
      10% Livyanu
       5% Mu'ugalavya, Salarvya, Yan Kor
       5% Northeast States, Mretten, etc.
   5% Aliens
   2% Enemies of Man
   3% Pariah Deities
 
With about 10% being Introductions and General notes which go a long 
way towards reducing the size of the various sections.

It's important to emphasize that many of these entries are going to be 
VERY brief.  Everything we know about the Ssu gods can probably be 
covered in two paragraphs.  The Nom deities are particular in detail, 
but common in theology to other deities in their area and don't 
require elaborate explanation.  There are about a dozen Northeast 
States, but they subscribe to one of two branches of a common mythos 
which can be explained in one section.  So it's not as overlarge as it 
may at first appear.

<Does the completion of the Pariah Deities chapter relate to prior 
discussion on the list of their worship being older than that of 
Pavar's pantheon?>

No, it relates to the size of the section being middling-small, and 
also the fact that they're quite interesting (if terrifying).  I 
wanted to start with a section which I could complete within a short 
time in order to take what I learned about the process of completion 
and apply it to a larger section.  

By the way, the worship of the Pariah Deities is, apparently, the 
OLDEST continuous theology on the planet, with the Shadow Gods coming 
in a close second...

<Wants and expects a list of the major human religions of the Five 
Empires and the major nonhuman religions, and enough personality and 
color to differentiate them>

That you will get.

<Just get the damned thing done!  It has taken too long and you've 
tried to cover too much!  Now that you've covered it, that's good, but 
the delay has been too great>

While some of this has been covered above, the only thing I'll add is 
that I am under no contract and have been offered no particular 
incentive to do this.  I've had to fit the creation of this book in 
around the birth of three children (premature twins and a singleton), 
the rise and fall of the Internet Gopher protocol of which I am a 
co-author, changing jobs, doing computer consulting to make ends meet 
while trying to change jobs, and building an addition onto my house in 
order to accomodate my growing family.

These aren't excuses -- they're life.  Sometimes *I* beat *myself* up 
in just this way, but such self-flagellation is useless.  In learning 
to live with the reality of just how long its taken to complete this 
work, I've had to come to recognize, understand and accept the 
obligations which my life, career and family impose upon me.

I don't say this for pity, sympathy or pats on the back -- I tell you 
this personal information solely to address your concern.  It is a 
legitimate concern.  I hope that if you understand that I actually DO 
have a life (one I'm neglecting this morning while I indulge in this 
missive, heh) it will help alleviate to some degree your frustration 
with how long this book is taking to produce.

That having been said, I will vent a tiny bit here by saying that TOME
never ASKED ME if they should run that silly ad showing the cover of 
Mitlanyal with "coming soon" plastered all over it at the back of one 
of the early "Adventures in Tekumel" books.  They've spoken with me 
about three times in my life, and the first time they asked me for an 
estimated date of completion was about a month ago.  So I refuse to 
take responsibility for expectations raised by them...

<Don't waste another year accomodating ideas gleaned from the Blue 
Room comments>

Oh, I won't.  Really, I'm seeking validation more than addition to the 
book.  I want to feel comfortable that I haven't missed anything 
obvious -- I don't want to try to accomodate everyone's everything.  
It would just kill me if I finished the thing and someone said "Hey!  
You left out Thumis!" or something REALLY obvious like that, and 
that's what I'm trying to avoid.

<I want the names of the people in the hierarchies of the temple, 
especially those in secret societies; the aspects and the foreign 
counterparts of the deities; the special ceremonies unique to each 
temple; the inner doctrines of the temple of Ksarul; the 32 
unspeakable acts of Dlamelish; the lesser demon races>

Mitlanyal will probably not satisfy ALL these desires.  First, people 
in the hierarchies come and go, especially at wartime.  Just look at 
the sourcebooks from 2355 -- many of those people are dead, retired, 
promoted or moved, and many supplanted by Dhich'une's cronies.  The 
fact is that it doesn't much matter what the name of the High 
Scholarly Priest of the Temple of Thumis in Usenanu is, what does 
matter is that the GM and Player understand what that role would 
demand of its occupant.  One would need to be politically savvy enough 
to hold the position, intelligent enough to achieve the post, 
sedentary enough in nature to remain in the temple bureaucracy and 
move up this high or cunning enough to have achieved an appointment 
to the post.  With those factors understood one can handle an 
encounter between whoever holds this post and a group of players, and 
convey the sense of connectedness and depth that is EPT's strength.

Many of the Aspects will be explained, and the foreign counterparts 
of the Gods will be named where possible.

A FEW special ceremonies of each of the temples will be given as 
examples, but they could not possibly be all described, or even named:
they vary from city to city and time to time.

The fact that there ARE Inner Doctrines to the Temple of Ksarul will 
be examined, but as with the ceremonies, they will not be explicitly 
named and described.  Why?  Because, again, they vary from city to 
city and time to time.

What, for example, are the Inner Doctrines of the Democratic Party in 
Houston?  Are these the same as the Inner Doctrines of the Democratic 
Party in Hawaii?  Are the schemes brewing in Minneapolis City Hall at 
all related to the schemes brewing in the City Hall in Miami?  In some 
broad ways, yes -- politicians are politicians, and common sense tells 
you that power, populism, claiming to fight crime and justifying tax 
increases by doing so all will play a factor.

Likewise common sense can describe the chaos which must be the Inner 
Temple of Ksarul during these years of revolution against a Sarku 
Emperor.  And once the 'dust settles' in Tsolyanu, the Inner Doctrines 
will settle with them into the more mundane issues of inter-temple 
rivalry, how to influence the Imperium, the growth in influence of the 
Ndalu clan over the Refulgent Blue Curtain society, etcetera.  And 
these will differ from place to place.

That there are 32 Unspeakable Acts of Dlamelish will be explained, and 
that they range from simple sexual rituals to complex displays of 
xenonecrophilia and more will be made apparent.  But they cannot be 
described for many reasons.  One is that as much as the publicity 
would help sales, I don't want my book banned across the nation.  
Another is that they, too, vary from place to place.  For instance the 
north of Tsolyanu is matriarchal, the south patriarchal.  Therefore 
many of the 32 Acts in the north will emphasize the dominance of the 
female, while in the south they will emphasize the dominance of the 
male.  

I hope that these replies help you understand more of what Mitlanyal 
looks like and where it's going.  I'll try to keep the list updated 
concerning how much of the book I've finished when I've finished it -- 
this will give me continuing impetus to stay focussed.  Right now the 
Pariah Deities are done, the Introduction to the book and brief 
history of Tekumel are done, and I am beginning work on the Hnalla 
Temple.

The "work" does not involve collecting more information -- that's 
done.  Most of my chapter-documents for the book are about 60K MS Word 
documents (empty 'chapter skeleton' documents are about 15K in size, 
so 45K of content).

The work involves running through each chapter, and integrating data 
which is written in various voices for various audiences into a single 
voice for a single audience.  Some are exerpts from novels, some are 
facts from articles written by the Professor, etcetera.  The facts 
have to be incorporated into a readable narrative voice which ties 
them together in a logical fashion.

Any missing "critical" gaps in information must be filled in through 
interviews with the professor, and then empty skeletal entries (i.e. 
"Cities of Broad Influence" for the Barrier Gods) must be discarded.  
Then the sections have to be proofed both for format and also for 
spelling and grammar.

Just between Livyanu and Tsolyanu I've got to do this 33 times.  I'll 
keep you informed how it goes...

To be liked, I feel it shouldn't just be a source-book - there should be
human interest, and some sort of storyline.  What I have in mind, is the
sort of thing done in RuneQuest's Cults of Prax (and Cults of Terror IIRC),
where you had a  story in boxes in the margin where a wandering merchant
encountered the various groups one after another.  This was also done in
Growing Up in Tekumel, and was all the better for it.

True, but if it's "Official Tekumel, some people will buy it even if it's 
"poorly written" or "amateurishly published" by some other's arbitrary 
standards.  Some people (like myself) just want more about "real" Tekumel.  
And they don't care whether it's published by "Company X" or "Company Y".  
After all, the important thing is "the game", not how well a product looks 
on a store shelf, or whether it wins awards from self-important people who 
don't even roleplay in Tekumel.

So, does this relate to an earlier discussion in this list about the

Alan Brain adds.....

>What do YOU want to see in Mitlanyal?  What do you EXPECT to see in 
>Mitlanyal?

What do I want?

1. More details, as in this newsletter, on Society, Secret and otherwise -
examples would be nice, telling a story...
2. More on the background, the Far Past. Emphasis on the fact that the
people on Tekumel are (generally) not Human as we know it - not Homo Sapiens
anyway, 100,000 years produces Evolutionary change, not merely cultural, and
who knows what meddling was done with DNA both by the technologists, and the
Gods.
3. More on the non-Tsolyanu.
4. More details on everybody's favourite enigma, the Good Old Doomed Prince,
his decline and fall.

What do I REALLY want?
A compendium - not just an index, the contents - of everything that's ever
been published as background, from articles in TSR the Last ( The Strategic
Review, before it became The Dragon) to the photos of varous temple models.

What do I expect?
Less. But will shell out the bucks anyway, provided it's less than $500 (not
a misprint)

[Moderator's Note:  Installment 5 of the London Thursday night game diaries. ]

12th Langala
Back to Jakalla finally. We had an uneventful trip (for us).
We went via Bey Su, and escorted a shipment of books for the
Temple of Chiteng in Jakalla. We were forced to dawdle by the
fact that Jadhak insisted on reading them all before we got to
Jakalla.

21st Langala
I got a call at the clanhouse from a representative of the 
governor of Chame'el. It seems his brother was captured by
pirates off Dlantla Isle. There has been no ransom demand, so he
suspects that he has been killed, but whatever, he would like us
to retrieve the body. I have no idea why he has approached us,
but it would be pleasant to have a sea voyage at this time of
year.

22nd Langala
We all went to a party at the Palace of the Moon, and a gang
of bandits attacked the house during dinner. We managed to
escape, though Emra, Ssomu and I had our pedhetl drained, leaving
us with the willpower of mrur. Kashu went to the Omnipotent Azure
Legion, who weren't interested

23rd Langala
We went back up to the Palace to confront the bandits, Emra
Ssomu and I still somewhat zombified. 

The leader was this guy with crystal hands. He revealed to
us that he had been a slave that Kashu had mutilated whilst
trying to test the effect of a couple of "Eyes" we had found. All
he wants to do is to get revenge on Kashu and become Emperor.
Pretty reasonable requests for a slave really. In true Kashu
style, he just killed the slave, Nuriyade, and pushed us into
this strange cabinet device to escape from the rest of the
bandits. 

Once in the cabinet our awareness returned, and we found
ourselves transportd to various places. I appeared with Kashu on
a narrow icy ledge on a vast cliff face. There was a cave behind
us. We were attacked by ice demons which we dealt with, and
entered the cave. We were in an ice maze, and encountered another
three demons; I slew two with a single blow. We found our way out
of the maze and came to a chamber where there was an ice block
with what appeared to be me inside. I struck it with the Hammer
and it shattered, and we found ourselves back in the Palace of
the Moon, with the others. 

The rest of the bandits had fled when the cabinet started
making strange and terrifying noises. The cabinet is now a
smoking wreck.

[                   I decided to post since Steve asks for discussion.      ]

I'd like a little further discussion on this topic (if you don't 
mind, please), as I (Churak) am up to my butt in brown-robes 
lately.

Sure, but duplicity and Machiavellian machinations are a way of 
life among the upper classes of Tekumel. Why not also a "way of 
death"? Is it possible that a  long-"lived" (ahem) Jajgi or two 
could be "pulling strings" (sight unseen) to influence political 
and social events in order *to advance the worship of Sarku or 
advance his religious objectives?* (note emphasis). Perhaps the 
desire for *personal* power dies when a person becomes undead, but 
religious fervor and the desire to advance one's faith may live on. 

Perhaps a talented Jajgi could be influencing events on Tekumel by 
playing powerful living Sarku worshippers like den-den counters.

>Most worshippers of the Worm Lord would not want their loved ones 
>turned into Mrur under any circumstances. 

So what was going on in Chapter 20 of "The Man of Gold" 
(particularly the "orgy of death" on page 159)? Was this a standard 
Sarku ritual or a "special event" cooked up by Dhich'une? Your 
article on Sarku worship seems to suggest the latter (in that only 
priests generally get to participate in this kind of "inner circle" 
event). By the way, these passages were the most memorable (and 
unsettling!) of the entire novel.

>Emperor Dhich'une is ASSUMED by many to be a Jajgi.

Two questions here; one concrete, the other hypothetical.

If Dhich'une is in fact undead, would this be detectable by magic?

Now for the hypothetical part, which assumes the answer to the last 
question is "yes". Since Dhich'une has left the Golden Tower at 
least once (that we know of), would it be possible for an sorcerous 
agent of one of the other heirs to get close enough to him to make 
the determination of whether or not he's undead? (There must be 
spies in Avanthar -- the last time Dhich'une "wasn't home", one of 
the heirs had advance notice). Or is he jumping in a tubeway car 
beneath Avanthar and zipping straight to the City of Sarku, with no 
chance for a palace insider to get near enough to him? (And what 
would the range on such a spell be, anyway?).
