Subject: Message 632: Kolumejalim I

[Moderator's Note:  Bob Alberti provides us with Arjai's first hand report of]
[                   the Tsolyani Kolumejalim (Part 1).                       ]

On the morning of 5 Hasanpor, 2369, Arjai hiVaisoner awoke in the Cloak of
Azure Gems clanhouse to the excited chatter of persons in the hallway.
He stuck his head out the door, and caught the attention of a passing
clansman.

"Lord, ah, Takan, isn't it?  What is the commotion?"

"Great doings, Lord Arjai!  A procession is arriving at Payel's Wall!"

"Then it's beginning!  Come, escort us to a place of good viewing:
I will rouse my wife."  Lord Arjai turned, hair mussed and dressed only
in a sleeping-kilt, to find Lady Chitlasha dressed, groomed and ready 
for the excursion.

"Ah, good, you're ready!" he exclaimed.  He swiped his hand quickly through
his unruly locks, threw on a hmelu-wool kilt embroidered with symbols of
clan and temple, pulled on a matching vest, and donned his sandals.

By the time he was ready Takan and Chitlasha were already in the courtyard.
No palanquins were in evidence, having apparently been commandeered by the
early-risers in the clanhouse, so putting propriety aside the three joined
the streaming throngs which headed south through Bey Su to Payel's Wall.

Upon arrival, Lady Chitlasha's status and demeanor sliced an easy path
through the crowd to the crenellated southern edge atop Payel's Wall.
Only a single black Pe Choi blocked their view, apparently oblivious to
Lady Chitlasha's burning glare.

"Greeticks, my laty!" he clicked, and then turned, "it hats bit a lok time
sits I sensed you near."

"Lord Mt'tk!" she beamed, taking an upper hand familiarly, "why it's been
years!"

"Come," he gestured outward, "I have setcuret a prime vatatge point!"

Lord Arjai introduced Lord Takan, and then the four turned their attention
the procession which was even now approaching.

The column was led by a procession of green-armored warriors.  "The crossbow
legion of the Emerald Kirtle?" posed Arjai, but no one responded, too 
engrossed in the approaching palanquin.  Borne by dozens of thick-armed 
slaves, it was pyramidal in structure and several paces square on each side.
Atop the pyramid rode a woman, shrouded in an enveloping green veil.

"Not Princess Ma'in?" began Takan, trailing away.  It was certainly not she.
In the retinue of this unknown Dlamelish candidate were the Lady Elulen,
a high priestess of the Goddess, escorted by a familiar figure.  Chitlasha
made a gesture and held a hand before her face.  "It is Lord Sunchan,
the Copraphage of Jakalla -- he has come up in the world, escorting Elulen!"

Next came ranked lines of black and white warriors, a legion of Pe Choi, 
followed by a waddling legion of greenish-grey Pachi Lei.  These bore heavy
casks which they tapped occasionally, hammering spigots into the sides and
aiming the spraying ale into the outstretched mugs and skins of the crowd.
Lord Arjai caught the attention of a member of the Clan of Delightful Repast
who traded him several skins of fruit juice for an exorbitant sum.

Next came a palanquin draped in indigo and azure, with silver trim.
Lord Taksuru Tlakotani, seated upon a golden throne surrounded by a silver
balustrade, held his hands up before the adulation of the crowd.  From his
palms a shining silver light overcame the bright morning sunlight to 
illuminate the faces of the populace with his blessing.

"I lunched with him in the clanhouse here before he was revealed!" blurted
Lord Arjai, "Who knew, who could have thought that he was an Imperial Heir?"
Lady Chitlasha fixed her husband with an amused and tolerant glance which
might, or might not, have meant "I did," and then turned back to the view.

The booming kettle drums of the Legion of Red Devastation came next, along
with the Legions of the Storm of Fire, and Searing Flame.  On carts behind
these legions were piles of the heads of their defeated foes, before which
marched the legendary Karim Missum, showing no signs of the injuries which
nearly felled him in the Taking of Avanthar.

In a roaring voice Missum announced the arrival of "The God Himself, the
Emperor Mirusiya Tlakotani!"  The crowd roared its approval, although Prince
Mirusiya was not yet, officially, more than the Emperor pro-tem until the
High Council of the Priesthoods could complete their rituals.

Upon a mighty burnt-orange palanquin stood Prince Mirusiya himself, and now
the roar of the crowd rose like a great beast to its feet.  The very air
shook with the noise, and many clapped their hands to their ears for a moment
in surprise before joining in the cry.  Servitors scattered gold and silver
coins into the crowd, and rubies and other gems.  The powerful figure of
Prince Mirusiya stood nobly gazing forward, seemingly oblivious to the 
commotion, gazing only ahead into his city.

When his retinue had passed through the gates, then came the white 
palanquin of Prince Rereshqala and his wife, Lady Sogai.  "There she is,"
murmured Chitlasha.  "I did something right, didn't I?" grinned Arjai,
"Getting the two of them together."  Again Chitlasha favored him with
a tolerant smile.

The blue and white legions of Serqu, Sword of the Empire followed next, along
with the smaller palanquins of further, anonymous Imperial Heirs.  For now
was the endgame in their hidden upbringing, now was when the Temples would
play their final pieces on the den-den board, turning over black pieces to
reveal more powerful colors.  It was unlikely that these candidates would
be able to wield any real power, or wrest any political support from their
half-brothers who had for so long exercised their privileges.  Still, the 
life of a former Imperial Heir was one of comfort, if the right alliances
were struck, the right deals agreed to.  And so they came to Bey Su, a young
girl in the colors of the Temple of Dilinala, a shrouded figure in Hru'u's
dark purple, and others as well.

Finally came the Mringukoi and the Hehellukoi, the High Nobility of the
Empire, in attendance only because of their ancient and noble lineages.
By this time much of the crowd had departed for the Temples of the various
Candidates and Heirs, where the feasting which would last many days was
beginning.

This was a strange time in Bey Su:  after so many years of siege, privation
and warfare, the Intercalary Days had begun with the heady announcement of
Prince Dhich'une's defeat in the Golden Tower and days of riotous celebration.
Now, only five days later, the celebrations began anew as the Kolumejalim was
begun.  

In their clanhouse the next morning Lady Chitlasha and Lord Arjai received
word that their friend, Lady Sogai, had requested their company for breakfast
at the Governor's Palace, which had been turned over for the comfort of Lord
Rereshqala while he visited.  After bathing and donning the appropriate form
for a festive evening, the palanquin arrived at the Palace and they were
greeted by their companion.  A great feast was underway, with guests of 
many high stations, but Lady Sogai spent some moments filling in Lady 
Chitlasha on the changes that had transpired while they were away.  

Prince Eselne was dead of a wasting illness, this they had heard, and
both Princesses Aremala and Ma'in had renounced the Gold -- the former to 
pursue her artistic endeavors, and the latter upon the collapse of all
her schemes and plans for power.  It was clear following Ma'in's abortive
attempt to seize power in Jakalla that none of her half-brothers and would
be interested in allying with her upon the Petal Throne.

The new candidates had largely followed the guidance of their mentors
and chaperones and expressed their intention not to oppose Mirusiya
for the throne, for to do so would mean only certain death for them
in the contests of the Kolumejalim.  And Lady Sogai assured them that
the longstanding rumors of Prince Rereshqala's disinterest in the Gold
were most likely true, although they did not discuss such things directly.

Finally Lady Sogai drifted away to greet other guests, only to be replaced
shortly thereafter by the resplendent figure of Lord Osumetlu, who had
taken his place in the High Chancery here in Bey Su.  After affectionate
greetings, Lord Osumetlu offered his apologies.  "I must proceed to
Lord Aknallu's side with all haste, for the rituals begin shortly.
If you wish to observe the activities, I suggest you proceed hence as well,
for my power and influence can save a place for you within the hall for only
so much time!"

Lord Osumetlu hurried away, and Chitlasha rose, as well.  "It's time," she
said.

Subject: Message 633: Kolumejalim II

[Moderator's Note:  Bob provides us with Arjai's report (Part 2).        ]

>From their vantage point in the balcony of the immense square chamber
of the High Chancery, Lord Arjai and Lady Chitlasha had a good view of
the Imperial Dais below, which was topped with the great golden seal of
the Empire.

Meeting, greeting and conversing with old friends and bitter enemies in
a convivial fashion, the mightest persons of the Empire were gathered to
observe the beginning of the rituals of the Kolumejalim.  Few would stay
for all the rites, which were lengthy and took several days, but none who
could attend would risk their chance to be present at the historic
presentation
of the candidates.

A hush fell over the murmuring crowd as ancient Lord Aknallu, the highest
of the members of the High Chancery, stepped forth to address the crowd.

"In the name of the Gods and in the Name of the Seal Emperor of Tsolyanu,
who sits forever in the Golden Tower of Avanthar, let us observe now the
Kolumejalim, the Rite of Choosing Emperors, as handed down to us through
tradition and ritual from the mouths of the Gods themselves, as revealed
by the Priest Pavar!"

Then did the hidden musicians and cantors undertake the grand music heard
only during the Kolumejalim, but for which they practiced every day of 
their lives for years.  From alcoves hidden behind stonework came songs
of glory and empire, nobility and faithfulness to the Gods of Tsolyanu.

While the songs rang out, the various candidates entered and took up
stations upon and around the great dais.  When the music was complete,
Korrikada hiKurrtashmu stood forth as the first speaker for his candidate
Prince Mirusiya.  He issued a brash and martial declaration, bestowing
credit for the salvation of the Empire upon his Prince with unreserved
grandeur.  Around them in the crowd, Arjai could see displeased looks
and whispered comments:  all knew that it was the union of the Princes
Taksuru, Rereshqala and Mirusiya which was finally victorious over the
former occupant of the Petal Throne.  Few wished to see that alliance
fractured, and such partisan claims as Lord Korrikada were making did
not contribute to the union.

Next stood forth Kettukal, formerly High General of the Empire, and
staunch ally of the departed Prince Eselne.  About him were arrayed
the finest surviving warriors of Eselne's army, who stood like gleaming
statues, moving not a muscle.  "We are here," barked the general, "We
are loyal in all ways to the Emperor.  All that is in the past is in the
past.  All that was between us is put aside.  The Army of the Empire
supports the Empire, the Army of the Empire is the sword of the Emperor!"

The crowd roared its approval of General Kettukal's grace and diplomacy,
which cast Korrikada's own brashness in stark relief.  In one simple yet
powerful statement, Kettukal had sealed the rift of civil strife between
the forces of Eselne and the other Princes.  No one present could doubt 
that at that moment Kettukal and all his men were ready to sacrifice their
lives at the behest of whoever was named Emperor of Tsolyanu.

Following Kettukal came a representative of the Temple of Belkhanu.
Their candidate was not present, he claimed, and Chitlasha and Arjai 
exchanged meaningful glances -- Lord Kirchta was, they knew, presiding
as Emperor in the Tsolyanu of an entirely different plane!  He went on
to speak in the uncharismatic fashion of his Temple of the establishment
of good government, and the building of order.  People began to stir
restlessly, and some at the back filed from the hall.  Sensing their
unease, Lord Aknallu called a halt to the day's proceedings, and all
retired to their palaces and temples for an evening of festivities.

The next day, the seventh of Hasanpor, the presentations began again.
First to speak was the representative of the Temple of Dlamelish, announcing
the renouncement of the gold on behalf of their candidate, young 
Princess Nareshana.  "She had an arrangement with the lad from Hru'u," 
whispered Chitlasha to her husband, "the two of them will renounce together
in exchange for certain favors granted by Prince Mirusiya."  

Next stood the representative of Prince Rereshqala.  "The words of the
mighty Prince are these," he declared, "That he shall, at last, renounce
the Gold, not in recognition of his own advancing years, but in truth out
of a deep love of his Empire, that it should not be divided again."  The
crowd murmured its approval, for this was expected, but also welcome.

In quick succession the representatives for Prince Surundano and Princess
Asudlana -- who was hitherto unknown -- renounced their claims.
Then stood forth a representative in the dark blue of the Temple of
Ksarul.  "Prince Mridobu," he began, and the crowd hushed.  The Prince
had been missing and assumed dead for over a year -- was he now to emerge
and stake his claim?  "Has no voice in these matters!" finished the 
representative.  The Prince, then, remained missing.

Prince Hehineshmu Tlakotani, of the Temple of Hru'u, stood himself to 
renounce his own claim.  A scruffy and unkempt youth, he seemed entirely
out of place among the high persons, and would likely follow timid
Prince Surundano of the Temple of Thumis into a life of obscurity within
his Temple.

A banner was then brought forth, dark red with the emblem of Prince
Eselne.  No words were spoken for the fallen Prince, and after a time
the banner was lowered and removed.

Following the presentation of Prince Eselne's banner, a representative
from the Temple of Dilinala announced that young Princess Ke'el
Tlakotani did renounce the Gold in favor of Mighty Prince Mirusiya.

Then Prince Taksuru himself stood forth.  It was expected that he would
renounce the Gold in exchange for the High Generalship of the Empire.
But it was not to be so.  "I stand for the Gold!" he cried, and a wave
of shocked exclamations swept the room, "As is my right and my duty
to the Empire."

The shock of this announcement had hardly sunk in, when a tall figure
in brown robes stood forth.  Beneath the copper skullcap was the craggy
face of Lord Jayargo.  This was unexpected, for he represented Prince
Dhich'une and was his very lieutenant in Avanthar.  None could believe
that he had made his way into this very hall, and all dreaded his
announcement.  Would he declare that Prince Dhich'une would stand for
the Gold?

"Mighty Lords and Ladies, I protest!" he cried, "Lord Aknallu, call off
this charade!  There is but one Emperor, and he is Eternal Splendor!
This undertaking is illegitimate and illegal, carried out in haste and
without notification!"

"Enough Lord Jayargo!" barked Aknallu, his voice powerful despite his 
years.  "This proceeding is more legitimate than that forced upon the
High Chancery by your master following the passing of mighty Emperor
Hirkane!  If this undertaking is illegitimate, let your master file
a grievance!  If it is meaningless, let your master ignore it!  But 
if he wishes to participate, let him arrive and do so!  Else," cried
Aknallu, relishing the irony of his declaration, "if he cannot arrive
in time to declare his candidacy for the Gold, he forfeits his claim
to the candidates who are present!"

His face purple with fury, Lord Jayargo stalked off the dais and
disappeared up an aisle.  Arjai watched closely, for he had been 
acquainted with Jayargo years before, when they sailed to Livyanu
together.  It did not surprise him that Jayargo's figure was 
never silhouetted in the doorway of departure, yet it was clear
to all that he had gone.

Finally Prince Mirusiya stood forth upon the dais, and all eyes turned
to him.

"I Mirusiya Tlakotani do claim the Gold, as is my right and is my 
duty to the Empire and to the Gods!  I am the Emperor of Tsolyanu,
my sword has been guided by the Gods, my feet are firm planted in
the Empire's soil, my arms have wrested open the door to the Golden
Tower!  I claim the Petal Throne as the son of Hirkane Tlakotani, 
The Stone Upon Which the Universe Rests!"

Despite themselves, some of the Prince's supporters roared their 
approval and beat the floor with their feet before being quieted 
by their comrades.  After this unseemly breech of protocol, an
unexpected event took place.

Prince Taksuru Tlakotani stood, and marched up to where Prince Mirusiya
still faced the crowd upon the dais.

"In the interests of the Empire, and on behalf of my brother, I hereby
renounce all claim to the Gold.  I do this to prevent further war, to
heal all divisions, and to honor the Petal Throne!"

As the crowd discarded with propriety and roared its approval, Lady
Chitlasha leaned over to whisper to her husband.  "Clever," she 
spoke in his ear, "very clever -- they presented a divided front to 
draw out Dhich'une, to see what he would do.  If he was going to 
challenge them at all it would have been when he thought them 
divided over the Gold.  Once Lord Jayargo played his meager hand,
once Prince Dhich'une's representative was forced off the field, 
the Princes once again closed ranks."

"That was indeed clever -- a strategem with the handiwork of our Prince
Taksuru upon it!" replied Arjai, "Did you know I once lunched with him
in our..."

But he was interrupted by the Prince, who had begun speaking again.

"We are brothers," declared Mirusiya, and he stepped forth to embrace
Prince Taksuru.  "We are builders!  We live together, we die together!
Avanthar is the capital of the Universe because we make it so!  We 
include a third!" and with this they turned to Prince Rereshqala, 
who nodded to acknowledge their attention.

"Three beautiful lights are in the sky over Bey Su!" cried Mirusiya,
"The Gods smile upon our Empire and upon the Emperor in the Golden 
Tower!  Go forth!  Celebrate!  Let the festivities not cease until
the Golden Door closes, and let them thereafter renew for many days!
I have claimed it, we have won it, the Empire of the Petal Throne!"

The roaring and cheering echoed throughout the audience chamber of
the High Chancery of the Priesthoods in Bey Su in a manner most 
unbecoming its dignity and grandeur.  But, for a while, even
stodgy Lord Aknallu grinned like the lad he once was.
