***Htiq-khu** C

***Dkik-dsa-ke** NC

***Long Tails:** An all Pé Chói clan who are spread all over the empire. The integration of Pé

Chói into human society has been going on for thousands of years. This clan

was recognized by the ruler of Béy Sǘ during the “Time of No Kings” over

2,000 years ago. The Long Tails came to Tumíssa about 1,000 years ago and are

regarded as a medium status clan there. Many members of the clan have served

as Nipw-nchopk and a few have served as Tii-petk for the Pé Chói district.

The members are equally divided between change and stability, and, unlike

their country cousins, they are not deeply religious. They all get along fine

though there is friction between those who join the priesthoods of human

temples. Their rivals as the leading Pé Chói clan in the Tumíssa area are the

Dkik-dsa-ke clan, many who are members of the legion of the same name as well

as dedicated followers of Hnálla. In Yi'ita, outside of Tumíssa, the Long

Tails have one small clan house with 15 members who all work as civil

servants in the Palace of the Realm. NC

Sa-Sárq's Citadel in Malcháiran: the outer walls of the rambling structure were constructed of rough-hewn stone blocks, but the upper storeys were of dark timber. The central keep was ancient, square, ugly, and thick walled, will crenelated battlements around its flat roof. The outer ward contained towers, walls, domes, colonnades, and two dilapidated wings that had once pretended to grandeur. The place had begun as a small fortalice; later owners had made additions and built new edifices; others had corrected those, joined them, rebuilt them, and ended with an architectural mishmash that defied reason. Everywhere was decay.

Sorokhán were old when the Dragon Warriors rose to power. [PoS]

Afternoons in Salarvyá are best reserved for sleeping due to the heat.

Ajján: This coastal city (S&G Map 3) just outside the Chadára Protectorate is a typical Salarvyáni coastal city/town. The coast nearby is studded with enchanted Stelea to repel pirate attacks. The walls are in good repair, and town within has narrow streets, elaborately decorated buildings as well as the noticeable odor of human bodies, strong pomades, and baking raw sewage. There is a frowning fortress where the ruling family (the Khelantikesh) resides, over looking the walls, but a long arrow shot within; they are strongly tied to the Chruggílléshmu family of Tsatsayágga. Townsfolk bustle about their business, and curious children fallow travelers if they enter the town. The ships of the Nchésh of the Sea Gray Wave visit frequently, recruiting personnel as well as taking on supplies and repairing their vessels so dock and docking facilities are in good repair. Papers from the Chruggílléshmu are usually respected, but on the other hand, travelers from Jéggeth may be scrutinized as possible agents from the Gürrüshyúgga from Tsa'avtúlgu. There are some court factions that want closer ties with Tsa'avtúlgu.

Fort Ormichash: Hexagonal Hall of Ancient Banners sits atop the tallest turret tower in the palace.

Walled all around and guarded by a frowning fortress that rose behind the commercial district to overlook the harbor. Fearsome images of the Goddess Shiringgáyi guarded the canal that led from the sea to the thriving port district. Farther away several drum towers, with walls at least four man-heights thick, stood at the eastern and western approaches to the ridge behind the city. The Éngsvanyáli engineers had leveled that ridge centuries ago and constructed a pillared pleasure palace of whit marble and rose-red coral upon the highest pinnacle of the escarpment. Every corner and cranny of the Lord's dwelling is embellished with mosaics of gold and rare gems. The windows are single slabs of thin alabaster, each pierced with a thousand arabesques so dainty that they admit the light like lace. In every niche stands a statue of a dignitary from the illustrious past. Every surface is a delight of tessellation and artful mosaic. Each chamber differs in its décor: some are faced with pink coral, others with polished turquoise to give the sense of being deep beneath the sea. The furnishings are of the rarest woods and the most costly fabrics.

It is soft when dug up but hardens when exposed to air. The port are of the city is up the Mriáz river which is protected by maroon colored towers with artillery emplaced atop them.

Muállu: This coastal city (S&G Map 3) located near the middle of the Chadára Protectorate's coast line is a typical Salarvyáni coastal city/town. The coast nearby is studded with enchanted Stelea to repel pirate attacks. The walls are in good repair, and town within has narrow streets, elaborately decorated buildings as well as the noticeable odor of human bodies, strong pomades, and baking raw sewage. There is a frowning fortress where the ruling family (the Hwa'altikonesh) resides, over looking the walls, but a long arrow shot within. They were placed in power by the Chruggílléshmu to remove the Ruthoshshikh family who ruled the Chadára before it was conquered and became a Protectorate. The town is to small (average population 30,000) to figure into higher politics, and it does not suffer from the attentions of the Gürrüshyúgga from Tsa'avúlga. This freedom from outside meddling allows the rulers to keep a firm hand on the protectorate. Political dissidents are swiftly suppressed, which helps to maintain the town's status as a sleepy backwater. Prices are high, outsiders are not encouraged to stay after trading, and there is little for sailors or other travelers to do. Most press on to Peléis or Ajján as fast as possible. The city's buildings tend to be of a light gray limestone with gray tiled roofs made from the local clay. The artisans are not as skilled as in Tsatsayágga (or Ajján, for that matter), but they labor hard to cover every available surface with carved vines, faces (demons or otherwise), and praises to Shiringgáyi.

Naggás: the city's walls are well-maintained, with spells and warning carved into them along with magical stelea raised along the shore line. The governor is Lord Mmachutusu Hruchchittlantyal, and his palace is high above the city, each side carved with a massive, frowning face, which is why it is called “the Palace of the Four Faces.” Local legend says that four brother wizards of the Fisherman Kings were merged into the tower by the demon Shibb'tlekhkharm, who was cheated of payment for his services in creating the port. The streets ascend from the port to the rise of the palace, and then descend down to the other side. The rich folk live near the rise, and the poor live closer to the walls, and especially by the waterfront. The Foreigner's Quarter is small and divided from the rest of the town by the Zurr river. This city (average population of 150,000) is at the far end of Chruggílléshmu influence, and although the ruling Hruchchittlantyal family owes their fealty to the Chruggílléshmu family through the Vringgamuluk family of Shíggath, they are well aware they are at the edge of their sphere, and the Gürrüshyúgga of Tsa'avtúlgu have designs upon their city. They have committed their forces to the war with Tsa'avtúlgu by way of Shíggath, but the war has been stalemated for years.

Nchésh of the Trampling Hoard: An Ahoggyá legion of the priestesses of Shiringgáyi at Lake Mrissútl and treated almost as pets.

Ocher hued sea rushes in eastern Salarvyá.

Ojjága Flats: this area is famous for its shell fish. The Salarvyáni relish the Shúggwa (a black, pulpy thing in a tubular shell) which they eat raw, accompanied by a fiery seaweed paste which beginners find vile, and the Ghighánnok (a disk shaped, 12-l egged, creature in a hard shell) that is baked over coals. One may also mention the sea vegetables such as Jujjókhkh, a muddy-green globule of a rubbery consistency, or the Ng'atlmóch, a flabby mass with crisp black bulbs throughout, or Hlinnghóm clusters of small pods with a salty taste that is usually fried. The Haqél, “The Toother Dweller Below,” is appreciated here as a fine eating fish, although it is very expensive due to the dangers of hunting it (when they grow large enough they feed on those who hunt them and damage their boats and they are responsible for many lost limbs and deaths). The occasional monster sized ones threaten large vessels, and expeditions are mounted to hunt them down. A caution to foreigners: although these dishes are Salarvyáni delicacies, it takes non-native mouths months to acclimatize to them. In addition to tasting vile to the uninitiated, vomiting and severe diarrhea are common side-affects. Hlinnghóm is especially vile and only the locals eat it.

Pakhlün: low antecedents, treachery, dishonesty, etc. = a person from Háida Pakála.

Peléis: This town (average population 30,000) is thought to have the best cuisine of the four towns bordering the Ojjárga Flats. Its has the agricultural bounty of rich farm land outside its walls as well as the bounty of the sea from the flats. The markets are full of fine black bread, multi-colored fruits, and rich black Drónu wine. Foreigners find the land food easier to digest than the seafood, but the thick soup (Lollyánthi) made from the gelatinous “bones” of a spider is guaranteed to cause vomiting in an outlander (which is often quite amusing to the locals). The harbor is on the inside of the bay even though the southern suburbs of the town overlook the flats. The famous Achetláppen lighthouse and the Káummodh lighthouse of Fammánnashtl Isle (about 2 Tsán off the point)allows pilots for hire to guide ships around the point without stopping for the night. The city's sturdy granite walls and magical stelea to keep pirates away and occasionally a warship from the Nchésh of the Sea Gray Wave. There is a famous inn in the city, the Dhrümmillyithétl House, which has excellent seafood (but very greasy to Tsolyáni tastes), and good entertainment as well. If one wishes to discover what the Salarvyáni see in a greasy bowl of thick Lollyánthi soup, or a platter of baked Ghighánnok drizzled with Hmélu fat, a side dish of fried Jujjókhkh, and fine, thick black Drónu, this is the place to do it. Sailors often throw away their pay here, and so many of them have been thrown into the street that the section outside the inn is locally known as “the pauper's sleeping-mat.” This town has one of the few temples dedicated to the Dlamélish Aspect of Shiringgáyi, and it does a brisk business with sailors and travelers, though the local Peléisi sneer at the Tsolyáni inability to see Her in Her Oneness. The Peléisi are rather friendly, for Salarvyáni, but hard bargainers expecting to earn money from their hospitality; however, they are not friendly toward those from Tsa'avtúlgu (the Tsa'avúlguyáni) as they both fear and hate them. They will sometimes refer to that place as the “horrid city,” avoiding even its mention. The name of the ruling family is Wittupenukh, but it is part of the cultural tradition of the city that one never names a person, clan, or ruling group that is higher than your own. One says only “wowallyu khukh” (loosely translated as “the unmentioned one”). They are a canny family that values keeping the city pleasant and profitable. Travelers do not mind the high cost of things in the city because of the virtues of the place, and all are grateful that Shíggath up the coast of the bay shields them from the attentions of the Gürrüshyúgga, and they owe their loyalty to the Chruggílléshmu. The city is a good place to collect information (rumors or truth) without moving into non-Chruggílléshmu territory. Fammánnashtl Isle off Point Pu'ortlinggoch is sparsely populated (only the pilot's station at the lighthouse and a village) but contains large Hmélu herds, and Gǘdru plants are cultivated for cloth. Lichens on the isle are raised for dyes of ocher and rust, but demand outstrips supply. The villagers are thought to be simple and suspicious of visitors, but they spend money freely enough when they visit the city.

Pendéssa: small fortified town at a river crossing about 150 Tsán from Fort Órmichash toward Chichúvu. Taken by the Arikkái forces.

There are bronze bound gates that open to allow access to the walled inner harbor. The back wall of the citadel consisted of a sheer the cliff of the sugarloaf peak itself. The other walls were tremendously thick and massive. Machicolation along the upper parapets, and an octagonal tower that commanded the narrow pathway leading up to the temple. Gates, porticulises and passageways commanded by arrow slits guarded the way to a pleasant rotunda with windows that overlooked the city, the sea, the river ojór

Salarvyáni are sallow and hairy. They are self conscious about being hairy as no other people on Tékumel are.

Salarvyáni are trusted as far as one can throw them as misdirection and general humorous malice are common reactions to foreigners. One must check names 2-3 times, from several informants, and you should not be afraid to lie, cheat, and bluster in order to get what you want!

Seen from afar above the steaming, sweltering gray-green plain, the mansions of Salarvyá are gaudy mountains teaming with sculpted figures, ant-hills of color and chaotic movement, topped with gilded domes, bulbous cupolas, and sky-reaching gables all a-crawl with gargoyles and other mythic beasts – more than a man could assimilate if he stood rooted to the earth and gazed for thrice 3 thousand years!” description by the Tsolyáni traveler Diján hiBasküné (who died in 2117 A.S.).

Shíggath: This town (average population of 30,000) is a strong contrast to other towns on the Ojjárga Flats. It is situated by the mouth of the Tsa'av river, which is navigable up stream to Tsa'avtúlgu and the transshipment of goods from sea going vessels to riverine ones takes place here. The river spills an unpleasantly yellow-c olored mud into the bay and flats, and the waters near the town are stained with it. The ruler, Lord Chuggillishmayul Vringgamuluk, a fussy little man devoted to his creature comforts and the deference of his subjects. He is obsequious to those he is inferior to (notably powerful Chruggílléshmu and Gürrüshyúgga agents), and over bearing and demanding of those below him (he has been described to be “like a slimy hair-ball found under a rug). The Vringgamuluk family is the dominate political force of the Flats, and they have been fighting a war with the forces of Tsa'avtúlgu for years. The Tsa'avtúlgu armies are better equipped but indifferently lead as well as being poor fighters. The Shíggath forces are small and also poorly lead, but they are supplemented by troops sent from Naggás as well as hired Háida Pakála mercenaries. The Vringgamuluk citadel of black granite frowns over the town, and the black-hatted police force is known to be more concerned with extracting money than with enforcing the law, save for periodic sweeps for “known criminals.” It is rumored that travelers disappear here, and most visitors prefer to sleep on their ships or outside of town in tents (the city has its share of Gürrüshyúgga spies, and those travelers who interest the Lords of Tsa'avtúlgu may find themselves drugged and carried off). Although the town can hardly be considered a happy place, the citizens do bustle, and they seem to be fairly prosperous. There is a large amount of merchant traffic with buying and selling especially of luxury goods, and the taxes that are paid from this traffic flood into the town's coffers. The Vringgamuluk also collect tribute from the other families under it, as they do from those under them, and they “tax” all their “police” can strong arm outside the city either on land or water.

Ceremony: Service of the Investiture of Indigo.

His resting place is in the west.[YG-TM]

Life and enlightened self-interest are the prime commandments of Lord Ksárul.

This priesthood is one of the most secretive and complex organizations in the empire. Its real goals are hidden behind many layers of false or half-true statements. The Ndálu clan is one of the most secretive societies within the temple, and the Blue Light Society is another; however, unlike the Ndálu clan, the Blue Light does not wish to take part in the politics of the empire. Butrús is an ancient stronghold of the temple. The temple has a shrine in the (not so) ruined city of Hmákuyál: House of the Cerulean Clarity in the College of Mirrored Radiance. In that city also resides the Phantasmic Library of the Indigo Tower. There is also the subterranean shrine of the Azure Orb beneath the necropolis outside of Jakálla. The 1 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) commandment of the temple: Do only that which benefits you and do it cleverly!

The temple in Pála Jakálla has recently expanded its fiefs and holdings of townhouses thanks to the generosity of Kurshétl hiSsánmirin. It has 48 known members, has a superb collection of ancient books, some believed to be from pre-Time of Darkness, and over 50 eyes are held. The Society of Blue Light currently holds sway in the temple and has 28 known members including the chief priest. The Ndálu Clan has 28 member in and out of the temple. The temple has recently come into dispute with the temple of Thúmis over the discovery of one of their sponsored expeditions of an ancient Miyalun and flute.

The Cartographers of the Luminous Pylon: a group of two dozen adherents of Ksárul and Grugánu along with one of Dlamélish based in Tumíssa who are trying to map the many alternative demon planes. Serious magic users regard them as loonies.

The Stalkers of the Indigo Night is a secret organization dedicated to protecting Ksárul and Hrü'ǘ pilgrims on the road to the shrines of the Ruined City of Hmákuyál. The members come from the Temple Guards of the Temples of Ksárul, Grugánu, and Hrü'ǘ, and given the sinister nature of these “cults,” they are very likely to have other functions as well as policing the Sákbe roads and provincial highways leading to the ruined city.

The Tumíssan Temple has 60 guards and 120 or so clergy with a capacity for twice that.

The Temple of Grugánu currently has 20 guards and 30 clergy.

The Yi'ita (about 100 Tsán north of Tumíssa with population about 5,000) Temple of Ksárul serves about 100 people mainly from the Black Stone, Weeping Stone, and Black Hand clans.

To a Ksárulite knowledge possessed by those who do not follow Ksárul is not knowledge but ignorance. Theft under these conditions is not ignoble because those who had it were not noble – and able to retaliate.

The basic precept of the temple is that things can never be as they were. The cosmos is Change, and the only permanence in the universe is Change itself.

Qón

The Pála Jakálla temple has 30 known members, and liquid assets of 45,000 káitars. The Golden Refulgence Society (13 members), and the Society of Release from Eternity (Linked to Light Above the Tomb) are present in the temple.

Chaigári- Village of Ngalmessurakh(Ssǘ Crossing) population about 3,500 of which about 30% are Salarvyáni decent. There are no palaces in the village and a there are temples to Dlamelish, Avanthe, Shiringgáyi, and Belkhánu. The head man is Dik hiZhigau of the Green Kirtle clan. There is no formal garrison but a cohort of militia can be raised as needed. The third rate Sákbe road on the dike which runs along the river protecting the area from the rainy season floods has about 10 guards from the local militia.

Chaigári Protectorate:

1. Geography= Two main terrain features dominate Chaigári protectorate, Kákri Midállu

peak and its surrounding ranges, and the Kanayugára River. Kákri Midállu is the youngest of the three major mountain ranges in the vicinity, the others being Tláni Hidállu peak and the oldest being the Chayéngar range. All of these ranges have been caused by the collision of the Salarvyáni continent with that containing Tsolyánu Even though Tékumel lacks the uranium in its core which keeps the Earth's core fluid, its larger size led to a greater release of gravitational energy when it collapsed to provide a much larger fluid core with a longer cooling time. That plus the larger energy it received from its sun (until recently by geological time) have combined to give Tékumel a fluid core and a plastic mantle. This leads to volcanoes, earthquakes, and continental drift. Since continents are more common than oceans on Tékumel, continent-continent collisions are more common than continent-ocean collisions. Continent-continent collisions are spectacular. The Himalayas of northern India are the product of a continent-continent collision and are the highest mountains on Earth. Lake Baikal in the Soviet Union sits in a hole caused by a fault resulting from that collision, even though it is over 1500km away from the point of impact. In this case, the Tsolyáni-Salarvyáni continent moving north collided with the eastward moving Yán Koryáni-Jannuyáni continent. In the Chaigári region the initial impact created a series of east-west trending over thrusts which flung up the Chayéngar range and another series of ranges south of it. The Kanayugára river runs in a gap between these ranges. After the initial collision, the Salarvyáni portion of the continent rotated first one way, flinging up a series of northeast-southwest trending over thrusts on top of the east-west ones, and then the other throwing up more over thrusts in the northwest-southeast direction. Where these secondary over thrusts overlapped the original east-west over thrusts, mountains were piled on top of mountains. The results are the spectacular Tláni Hidállu and Kákri Midállu peaks. In the course of all of this, the 10km thick continental crust of Salarvyá was shortened by a hundred kilometers. All of that rock went up.

The other major geographic influence on the Chaigári is the Kanayugára river. For the best part of 50 million years there has been a Kanayugára river winding back and forth across its valley, working and reworking it. The valley is broad, flat, and steep-walled with a thick soil layer regularly recharged with fresh loam eroded from the mountains and brought down by fast flowing streams.

2. Geology= The mountains immediately north and south of the Kanayugára river are the oldest and hence the most eroded in the region. In some cases only the metamorphosed core of the original mountain remains, yielding marble, slate, and a few heat produced gem stones. In other places, whole cliff faces of sandstone and limestone present themselves for easy quarrying for building materials. A type of coal can also be found, but it is purplish in color and extremely malodorous. Any who can afford to use charcoal. Seeps of oil are also found here and there in the Chaigári, but this is particularly nasty stuff, evil smelling and extremely corrosive. Areas around such pools are devoid of normal life, although Food of the Ssǘ can be found growing there, and any who fall into such a pool could well find it the most unpleasant experience of their rapidly diminishing lives.

3. Agriculture= The broad, rich valley of the Kanayugára is somewhat cooler than the dusty plains of the Imperium and although Dná grain is cultivated, harder grains such as wheat are more common here. As well, many specialty fruits and vegetables not commonly available in the Imperium are available here, but the reverse is also true. High quality Ngalu fruit does not flourish here and therefore the Chaigári produces little decent wine with the possible exception of Fénul Some of its berry concoctions are drinkable and mildly amusing to the connoisseur. Those who can afford to, import wine. Hekéllu is somewhat well-known, however for the quality of both its wheat and barley beers.

Chaigári is chiefly known for its animal husbandry and land too poor to grow crops is used to graze the huge herds of Chlén, Hmá, and Hmélu, Chlén at the lowest and Hmélu at the highest. Final fattening of animals is often done at the lower elevations in recently harvested fields or fields allowed to lie fallow. This also helps enrich the fields.

4. Ethnicity= the protectorate was conquered from the Salarvyáni a little over three hundred years ago and many of its citizens claim Salarvyáni descent. Most of these live in and around the town of Fénul. Since the conquest there has been a steady stream of political refugees and more recently refugees from Ssǘ activities. Also some wealthier Salarvyáni choose to reside in Fénul owing to the lower and more consistent Tsolyáni tax structure.

Hekéllu contains few Salarvyáni, by contrast. Hekéllu was rather badly damaged during the conquest and since it was already long overdue for Ditlána, the town was leveled and built anew. Many of the Salarvyáni left at this time and were replaced by Tsolyáni. Tsolyáni had been colonizing the area for some time prior to the conquest in any case. Today only the lake fishing clans and some of the merchant clans claim direct Salarvyáni descent, and even these people appear to be Tsolyáni due to intermarriage.

Tsolyáni form most of the population of Hekéllu with the exceptions noted above and except for some native menials. Tsolyáni also dominate, if not form the majority of the population of the area around Hekéllu and the Kanayugára river as far east as the big bend. These areas have been heavily colonized by agricultural clans from Ferinára and Sokátis. Of the Tsolyáni in Hekéllu, most are from eastern based clans of scribes and officials and also merchant and transportation clans. Tsolyáni in Chaigári average 1-2 cm taller than their cousins in the Imperium owing to a diet higher in protein.

Most of the mountainous areas and portions of the river valley are populated by indigenous Chaigári tribesmen. These people owe a great deal ethnically to the Kilalámmuyáni and Jannuyáni stock. Short and of wiry build, they are poor agriculturalists, being at best subsistence level farmers. They are far better herdsmen, hunters and mountaineers. Lately they have been used as miners and quarrymen. Although their small stature suits them to mining, their light builds do not. There are better miners to be found elsewhere in the Imperium and some of these have begun moving into the area.

Their language has been identified as a dialect of Jannuyáni, but has borrowed a great deal from Tsolyáni and Salarvyáni. Because they tend to be quite insular, large variations in dialect can be found from mountain valley to mountain valley. In the north and west the Tsolyáni influences dominate and in the south the Salarvyáni becomes transcendent. Banditry is endemic among the tribesmen and while some of this may be attributed to the Kilalámmuyáni, the locals make up the bulk of the bandits. Tsolyáni proverb, "A Chaigári herdsman is a bandit who has stolen many animals."

5. Economy= The protectorate has several major industries and it depends on the year which is the largest income earner. Mining and quarrying are the largest industries in most years, however. In various places may be found tin, lead, zinc, silver, and gold. While almost no iron production exists in Chaigári, iron is found in western Kilalámmu and southeastern Milumanayá and a lot of ore finds its way to Hekéllu Most ores are concentrated in Hekéllu for trans-shipment to the larger centers but there is a small domestic steel industry which supplies Hekéllu armorers

Many gems and semi-precious stones are also brought out of the mountains. Jadeite, lapis lazuli, agate, carnelian, tiger eye, amethyst, and quartz are found in abundance. Opals, rubies, emeralds, garnets, diamonds, and sapphires are also found. An ornamental quartz called a Chaigár is peculiar to the foothills of Kákri Midállu peak and is found nowhere else in the known world. The rich translucent brown variety and the dark blue variety with pale veining are the most valuable. The pale blue, yellow, and purple varieties are too close in appearance to other types of ornamental quartz found elsewhere to be as valuable.

Chaigári and surrounding area produce abundant building quality stone. Limestone, sandstone, and slate are so common that kiln-dried brick is rare in Hekéllu and sundried brick is found as a temporary building material or in some of the river side villages. Even many of the poor live in sandstone buildings with slate roofs. The buildings of the rich, the temples, and the major public buildings are commonly faced with fine limestone and rich marbles. Gneiss and schist are also found and inlays of agate, quartz, and lapis lazuli are also seen. Basalt and granite are not to be found as the nearest sources are in the Hundránu Rise outside of Sokátis. Hekéllu therefore presents a pleasing facade of red, pink, white, cream, gray, blue, and even black buildings with gray slate roofs. Ample supplies of sand, gravel, and limestone have also led to a thriving cement and concrete industry. Much of the stone for export is at least rough dressed in Hekéllu or Fénul and thus the masonry clans are quite powerful in both towns.

The next leading export is meat. Huge herds of Hmélu and Hmá roam the rough ground and foothills of Chaigári. Hekéllu and Fénul both have packing industries, Hekéllu for shipping to the Imperium and Fénul to Salarvyá. Animals for export are slaughtered in the late fall to early spring in order that they may be shipped in cooler weather. They are usually lightly salted or smoked for preservation, but not heavily so as salt or wood for smoking both have to be imported. In addition, the higher reaches of the mountains contain game animals, such as Tsi'íl, which are hunted for their meat. Most such game is exported to places like Fasiltúm where it is served at the feasts of the wealthy. It is considerably cheaper in Hekéllu and it is a rare middle-class feast there where it is not included.

Chaigári is also known for the quality of its Chlén beasts. Most of these are peeled in situ but poorer armor producers are shipped out loaded as beasts of burden and sold at their destinations along with their cargoes. Some of the hides are merely treated to preserve them and shipped while others are turned into finished products in Hekéllu and Fénul There are thus several thriving armorer's clans in both towns and those in Hekéllu also make some steel armor on occasion with iron ore from Kilalámmu.

Farming is mostly for domestic consumption and in fact Dná grain often has to be brought in from Ferinára to meet needs, due to the shorter growing season and the shortage of arable land. Wheat and other rare hardy grains are more common and many of these are exported for specialty baking. The higher unit value of these grains usually means a net profit for Chaigári in most years.

Fishing is also worthy of note. Lake Hekéllu produces several species of edible fish, mostly for domestic consumption. The mountain streams also produce some excellent eating fish, although not in significant quantity. There are also several species of shellfish to be found in the lake and streams and these are considered gourmet delicacies. They are caught and rushed live in tanks of water to Sokátis and Fasiltúm to grace the tables of the truly wealthy. Additionally, there is a species of bottom dwelling fish in the lake which can be jigged for. While the fish itself is virtually inedible, in the fall the female produces a roe which commands a fancy price indeed at the tables of the very wealthy (up to 50K per kg in Fasiltúm, more elsewhere). The fish can get up to 6 meters in length and a single female can produce up to 10kg of roe. However, a single fisherman is lucky indeed if he gets more than a bite or two in a season. They fight hard once hooked, struggling for hours or even days, and frequently escape or sink the boat and eat the fisherman. Even when a catch has been boated it is a male as often as not. There is even a small chance that a female has already laid her eggs.

Although there are occasional woods and forested areas in the mountains, all hardwoods must be imported. The softwood forests of the Chaigári do produce some tall straight spars which are rafted down the river to Jakálla to make masts. These are superior to the usual hardwood masts because they do not require splicing to make a full mast and their lighter weight leaves the vessel lighter and less top heavy.

Another revenue earner is trade, between Tsolyánu and Salarvyá in Fénul and Hekéllu and between Tsolyánu and the states of the northeast in Hekéllu. Hekéllu is the effective head of navigation of the river for large barges and hence serves as headquarters for large numbers of carters, bargemen's, and mercantile clans. One clan is able through a clan secret to produce ice, even in summer. It is they who ship roe and other valuable perishables by refrigerating them. The price is very high, however, and the process is dangerous and leads to periodic damage by fire or explosion to the clan house.

Chákan justice: one who is wronged goes directly to the clanhouse of the one who has committed the wrong. If the culprit's clanmaster concurs, there is redress at once,without appeal or delay.

Company of the Crystal Sword- This group started out as a band of hardy adventurers of medium clan who found a benefactor in Lord Hetepk hiAztlan. In the course of many adventures, the wealth of Hetepk grew, and the band became the Company. Hetepk became aware of a legend of great antiquity concerning a King of the Dragon Warriors and his six sons. To each son he gave a powerful sword, each having the essence of one of the elements. The search for these weapons was long, and the Clan of the Silver Links was grateful and took the band into it which worked to the benefit of both. [BRA] Court of Crys in the city of Púrdimal below the Temple of Ksárul and outside of the Temple of Hrü'ǘ is known for its apothecary shops and drug sellers. One of the best known is Gdeshmaru, an evil-visaged Salarvyáni.

Fasiltúm has mines.

Fénul: there are two roads leading from Fénul northward. A minor one that skirts the Kákri Midallu Peak highlands and the Ssǘ enclave, and a major provincial highway that skirts the Salarvyáni border then follows the provincial border through the highlands between Tláni Hidallu Peak and Kákri Midallu Peak to Hekéllu. Most of the mines in the highlands of the area north of Fénul are owned by the Imperium, but there are clan as well as personal ownership of some. The mines employ free men but the heavy labor is done by slaves. These are purchased in Tsolyánu, loaded with supplies and marched to Hekéllu and or Fénul and thence to the mines. They are then worked until they die but not in the way the Nazis or Soviets did. Discipline is not a problem as those who are a problem are placed outside the compound at night and nature takes its course. There are gold, silver, copper, tin, and a very few small iron mines in the area.

Jakálla- There are three Jakállas: Pála Jakálla, Jakálla, and Músa Jakálla. Population

averages are: Pála- 30,000, Jakálla- 600,000, Músa- 7,500. The Gate of Bones (that gate which leads to the City of the Dead) is officially named the “High Gate of Chaimaktel” who was a mistress of Ssirandár I, but the gate was really built during the last Ditlána.

Kachor chiefs of the Inner Range of the Chákas.

Kashkomái- A little valley in the mountains to the east of Sokátis where the “Worm Prince”

retired after his mind was befuddled. There are iron mines there.

Katalál- Most people in this city worship the war gods but Vimúhla and Chiténg are

worshiped the most, and other Stability Gods are not popular. Its walls are red-a

and-black chequered and there is a tiny blue lake that is fed by artisan wells. The streets are lines with Gápul trees, and it is known for its roof gardens giving it the look of an overgrown mound. The white governor's palace is above the lake, and the temples of Karakán and Vimúhla face each other across the square. Traditional garb is of kilts with red-and-black checks and stripes, short cloaks of thésun gauze, and flat, wide-brimmed hats of enameled Chlén-hide. The unpretentious Temple of Thúmis is on a side street of the main square.

Khirgár has walls and towers that are bluff brown in color. Hot in the summer, windy in the spring and autumn, blustery and sometimes chill in the winter. Upon its steep hill, the old town hoarded its memories to itself. The lowest concentric ring of walls was of red sandstone and black basalt, and the gates bore the sigil of Emperor Metlunel II “the Builder.” Within these ramparts, the second ring skirted the lower slopes of the hill; this was made of Éngsvanyáli gray granite brought from the mountains to the east. The third and highest battlements, those surrounding the edifices of the dim age of the Bednálljans, the First Imperium, were of marble and black diorite, stone not found in the area. Bands of sand-scoured glyphs marched around these innermost and highest towers proclaiming the majesty of Queen Nayári of the Silken Thighs. Other slender spires spoke of the Priestkings of Éngsvan hla Gánga, the Golden Age of Pavár. The truncated pyramids and monumental walls of the present Second Imperium jostled for room amongst these older, more graceful structures. Upper Town is quieter, the narrow, wind-worn, many storeyed clanhouses leaning against one another like old ladies exhausted from a day's excursion. There is a steep climb to the Gates of the Blue Fish, named for some hoary, local deity. High God Hill, beyond the Blue Fish Gate, had once been arranged in a neat square around a central plaza: armory and legion barracks to the left of the gatehouse at the southeast corner; the colonnades of the administrative offices opposite in the southwest; the temples crowded together along the crest of the hill in the north- west; and the Citadel of Victories of the Emperor on the summit to the northeast, facing the windy deserts beyond which lay Milumanayá and Yán Kór. The citadel dated from the First Imperium, but had been rebuilt and refurbished many times. The pattern of High God Hill had been spoiled by buildings thrown up helter-skelter during the past 1,000 years so that the plaza existed only as an irregular patch of rutted stone around the stump of an Éngsvanyáli obelisk while the clanhouses of the newly rich jostled with each other for a place in its shadow. The army had built more barracks here, the temples an annex there, the Imperium another hall for scribes and records in that corner. The citadel has bronze banded gates. The city is usually crowed but the war made things worse.

Rǘ- Just north of the Hundránu Rise lies the little valley of Kaskkomai where there is much agriculture. Near Rǘ the terrain is hilly, with fields and copses interspersed with stands of larger trees. As one travels north toward the Rise, the hills become higher and less easy to traverse, until one reaches the top of the low pass between the Rise and the Gilráya Forest. The forest is quite dense with many critters and animals. The trees are deciduous (Gapúl, Dáichu, etc.), with occasional small, hardy peasant holdings. South of Rǘ the Sákbe road runs to neighboring Mmilláka, a Salarvyáni city par excellence. The countryside is filled with villages, small towns, farms, and grazing for herds of meat animals. The great city of Koylugá consumes most of the produce from this area while some goes to Khúm also. Around Tláni Hidállu peak there are some sheer precipices and dizzy climbs with Ssǘ rumored to be around. The higher one goes the vegetation tends towards dense stands of black-needled Tíu trees. Higher up, the summits of the peaks in the area are bare or only sparsely covered with high mountain scrub. The lower slopes of neighboring Kákri Mídallu peak is inhabited by hardy, suspicious, courageous farmers – the region is invaded, raided, and terrorized by groups of Ssǘ, who have become bolder in recent years. The peaks of the Chayéngar Range are higher and wilder yet.

This city is an anomaly: a Tsolyáni town right on the edge of the border of Salarvyá, with which it trades constantly. It is under considerable Salarvyáni influence but still retains its essential character. It was founded during the rein of Kánmi'yel Nikúma I (1031-1067 A.S.). Later, at the time of the Siege of Mmilláka, Emperor Hejjéka II “the Heretic” (1325-1340 A.S.), populated it with colonists from the east-central provinces of the empire. He expected it would be the first to carry the banners of Tsolyánu into the Salarvyáni homeland. This did not work: the “invasion” ended in a standoff, with the Tsolyáni facing a sea of hostile Salarvyáni around them. The Salarvyáni tolerated Rǘ because it was a useful trading depot, but they allow few Tsolyáni into their own areas. The teaching of the Tsolyáni language as well as the Tsolyáni temples is forbidden, especially the Éngsvanyáli doctrine that the two goddesses Avánthe and Dlamélish are separate beings: the Salarvyáni consider them to be Aspects of one Goddess Shiringgáyi.

Emperor Gyésmu, the Iron Fist (2015-2065 A.S.) restored the town and started to construct fortifications and public buildings, but these were left unfinished when he died. Up until the ascension of Emperor Dhich'uné, it was a backwater town, with large a population of Salarvyáni and Tsolyáni merchants and culture. Shortly after that ascension, the Salarvyáni struck out from Koylugá and Khúm to take it back. They took the town, but eventually had to give it up. They were going to burn it to the ground, but the Tsolyáni governor persuaded them not to (the merchants clans of the town also have alliances with Salarvyáni merchant clans and they put pressure on also).

The town is roughly an oval, with various small lakes and ponds on the south, in the midst of lush fields and groves of trees. The Gilráya Forest begins to the west, and parties of noble hunters often come to try their luck with Sérudla and other beasts there. About 80-90 Tsán to the south lies the ancient city of Mmilláka, besieged by Emperor Hejjéka II during 1300 A.S. It is much more of a typical Salarvyáni city with bulbous domes, thick pillars, ornate decoration and colorful and opulent palaces.

Nobility: All citizens of the Five Empires agree upon one great ethical principle, suckled with their mother's milk since the days of the Éngsvanyáli Priestkings! This is the concept of Noble Action: people may follow any moral code, any religious belief, any political or social doctrine, as long as it has the sanction of their faith and tradition. Those who obey their teachings openly and proudly are “noble”; those who are lazy, hypocritical, weak, or unwilling to act are “ignoble” and beneath contempt. Warfare is thus noble to followers of Lord Karakán when it is fought for the prosperity and stability of the state. He also ordains the sacrifice of captured enemy warriors upon his altars. This is “noble” for the War-god's devotees. Those who serve less-violent deities must tolerate this behavior, if they would be tolerated in their turn.

He is a relatively honorable man, however, and has only been known to sell a few of his Tsolyáni visitors into slavery across in Háida Pakála or into something worse in Tsa'avtúlgu – and only because they annoyed him or were arrogant or perhaps worshiped Durritlámish, who he particularly loathes. They say his breath stinks bad enough to slay a Chlén-beast! Also, they say his womenfolk have to eat a Salarvyáni herb that completely kills their sense of smell, and his bodily cleanliness is just as bad so stand upwind! [BRA]
