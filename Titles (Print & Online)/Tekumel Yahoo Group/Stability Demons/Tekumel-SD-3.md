Book of Crystal Bindings

Harúchamal, The Plovers of the Further Shores

This race of demons is of the Substance of Hnalla and the Essence of

Belkhanu and dwell on the Plane of Golden Sands, the first of the

Paradises Beyond the Isles of Teretane. They appear as birds with

rainbow-hued crystalline plumage, steel-grey beaks and four stilt

like legs and their eyes shine golden as the eternal sunset of their

home plane.

The exact criteria of how souls end up in the Paradises is a matter

of continual argument among the philosophers and extra-planar

explorers of the Temple of Belkhanu, but is would seem that in some

cases gifted people's Balétl, or Spirit-Soul can be washed up in the

Plane of Golden Sands by the Tides of Dreams. There they are picked

over by the Harúchamal, who eat them and then transport the soul to

its appropriate fate, be that immolation in the light of Hnalla,

being laid as a spirit egg in the body of a newborn sentient back on

Tekumel, or as a being on another plane of existence or within a

paradise of a specific god.

They are summoned by priests of Belkhanu who bargain with them for

their aid in carrying messages to and from long departed souls, and,

if they can, to retrieve specific souls and ensure their rebirth on

this plane.

The ritual must be carried out at sunset on the shortest day of the

year, beginning as the lower edge of the sun disc touches the

horizon. The summoner, who must be a priest of Belkhanu of at least

the 12th circle, stands inside a protective circle drawn in powdered

topaz and agate with a choir of fifteen choristers and assistants who

chant the sixteenth through eighteenth stanzas of the Hymn of

Mórskodel, master of the Harúchamal in endless overlapping cycles.

The light of the dying sun is focussed onto a spot on a marble wall

in front of the circle through a yellow lens. At the first phrase of

the summoning this is made into a nexus point by the use of

Visitations of the Other Planes, and the summoner invites the

Harúchamal, whose individual secret name he must know, to bargain

with him.

The second phase involves the sacrifice of at least one M'rur or

Shedra by means of the Viaticum of the Yellow Robe, thus releasing

its spirit soul back into the Tide of Dreams, an act pleasing to the

Harúchamal who will eagerly await its arrival at the farther shores.

The last phase is the striking of the bargain. This must be done

quickly and efficiently, as the Harúchamal will leave as the final

glimmer of light from the setting sun fades away and the bright nexus

point closes behind it. These unearthly birds will demand whole logs

of white Ssar wood carved into spirals for their nests, agates and

quartz crystals, and magical items such as Eyes and Talismans. Under

no circumstances should one leave the protective circle to remove the

diamond studded golden ticks from the Haruchamal's plumage, even if

asked, as the bird will grab your Baletl and drop it into the Sea of

Souls. Once the bargain is struck the bird flies off to search for

the departed soul and returns within seconds. Messages to the dead

cannot exceed twenty words and their replies rarely exceed ten.

The Harúchamal cannot contact every dead soul. Some are too recently

dead and still float among in the seas around the Isles of Teretane.

Others have been removed from the endless cycle of souls by having

their corresponding bodies made into undead, yet others have been

absorbed into the light of Hnalla or the dark of Hru'u and yet others

walk the mundane planes clothed in new bodies. If it cannot find a

soul it will at least inform the summoner why before disappearing

with its payment.

There is a binding spell that, it is said, can compel a Haruchamal to

act as a steed, carrying the summoner to a specific place within the

Isles of Teretane or the Paradises Beyond. Those who use this spell

must be aware that time often travels at very different rates within

these planes and their journey may take centuries to complete.
