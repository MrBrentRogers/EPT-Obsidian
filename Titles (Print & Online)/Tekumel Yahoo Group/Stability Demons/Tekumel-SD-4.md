Well jeez, if we're making it a matter of HONOR, I'm in.

So this afternoon I drafted two versions, actually. One I'm very proud of, I think I really

captured the spirit of Tekumel. The other, yeah, I admit: not so much.

#1: Nipply Nipples

Nipple Of Noble Nippling, Nippler With The Nipple-Nippled Nipple

La! Nipply nipple nipple nipple nippled, shamtla nipple. La! Nobility and nipple, Lord

Nipple nippling clan nipple nipply nip. Nipward to nippity, Lady Nipple nippling like nipple

nipple nipple nipple, nipple nipple nipple nipple nipple. Ohe! Shamtla for nipped nipple

nippling, no nipple nipple at nipple, la, niplesse oblige. Nipple â€œlanâ€ nipple (i.e., â€œnubsâ€) â€"

or nipple nipple nipple, nga!

Then nipple the nippling nipple of noble Velimir hiLebnikov, Lord of Nipple (nippling with

nipples):

O, nip out in nipples, nipplers!

O, forenip your nippling, nipplers!

You who nipple with nippling and you who nip of the nippable,

O, nip away nipplingly!

O, nippable nipping-nips â€" the nippery of nipplesome nipplers!

O, innipple enniplingly, the nipplestasis of out-nippling nippleteers!

Nipplitude, nipplitude,

Upnippple, downnipple, nipply, nipply.

Nipplery, nipplery.

O, burst out your nipples, nipplers!

O, point forward your nipples, nipplers!

Each nipple nippled, nipple nip but nip nipping nipples: Nipplificatery, Nipplomancy,

Nipplofaction. "High ride" nipples nipples (up the nipple!), so nipple bussan and each

nippling clan, nga! Nipple nipple nip-niply nippled nipples and nipple where nippling

nipples nip in nipping nipples. La, all-nippled eternipple, nipple in nipple as nippled.

Nipple nipple nipple nipple, and so to nipple. Boobies.

Reckon I nailed it, huh?

OK, so it comes in some seventy-odd nipplemes short of spec. And Tekumel demands

plenitude. So if it won't do, there's the next draft:

#2: Tuâ€™ikkir MrizhÃºn

Lord Of Fretful Pondering, Voyager Upon The Bitter Sea Of Right-Turned Salts

It was the war-wizards of Kurdis who found the God That Speaks Like a Kaika-bird, far

down in the Unending Gray, and it was they who first summoned him to this Plane (with

much travail, he being of the Essence of Thumis and of the Substance of Hnalla and so

ungracious towards their sect) when they sought to invade the northern mountains in

times before our grandfathers. Tuâ€™ikkir loaned their armies his power of Telecelerification,

allowing them to march at full speed for many days on end and so outflank the barbarian

hordes. Holunthaimish of Jaikalor has written, verily, Tuâ€™ikkir is the Broken Antithesis of

Lord Dra, for while the Consort is without interest in the matter of What Exists, the

Objectionable Companion, the starveling Tuâ€™ikkir, cannot stop thinking upon it, nay, not

even stopping for rest or nourishment.

Modern theurges call upon him (using one of several rituals, ink concerning all of which

the Omnipotent Azure Legion has prohibited from ever touching Firya-paper â€" alas, gentle

reader!) most of all for his mantic puissance.

When Tuâ€™ikkir appears before the summoner, always in different guise but ever with a

deathly pallor, hectic flush, restless like Tnoth-locusts at sunrise, his eyes sunken; and his

mouth â€" lo, the mouth: thereupon, none who have gazed have dared to write. The

summoner must erect no wardings, lest the shy and insecure Entity take umbrage and flee.

Upon being asked a question, on whatsoever matter the mind may trip across and no

matter what fiendish complexity or seeming vacuity, Tuâ€™ikkir shall immediately conduct

the wizard and select companions into the Manifold of Planes in fevered pursuit of

sagacity. No Waba he; but should the summoner stay firm, never lose sight of Tuâ€™ikkir or

permit the chirruping Entity to stray far from the vexing question posed, he shall certainly

be led to an answer of astounding thoroughness, assuredly with many surprising

parenthetical insights and speculations. [Marginal commentary by unknown hand: â€œWoe to

he who fails to recognize the signs of flagging vitality in the tenacious Tuâ€™ikkir! Renew the

summoning ritual promptly lest the guide disintegrate into base matters and leave the

party stranded in the Transpylonic wastes.â€]

Tuâ€™ikkir may also, upon earnest request of a summoner or attendant thereon, temporarily

bestow his gifts of Cuculoglossia, Hysteriognosis, and Brugmopoeia. Moreover, all those

who travel in the fitful wake of the Voyager bask in the euphoric, though strangely bitter,

Sunshine of Hnalla. Their hearts lift and flutter lightly in their chests; their minds clear of

self-doubt and sadness; all weariness dissipates from their limbs and their eyes tingle

with enthusiasm; they may void their bowels; and they join in the realization that the

Illumination of All the World can be grasped by all, even vile mortals, so long as they resist

the wicked blandishments of the Sleeping Princeâ€™s hypnopompic minions (many and subtle

are their tricks!) and remain pert and wakeful.
