**Dénggur, He Who Sees ALL**

Dénggur cannot be summoned to this plane, but he can be visited in his own realm, the Valley of Pearl Mists. He is of the Substance of Thúmis and the Essence of Drá, but welcomes all into his presence, in so far as he can be said to welcome anyone.

The entrance to the Valley of Pearl Mists is not easy to find. Various scholars have placed it in the Cave of Winds, in the mountains of the Thirteenth Isle of Teretane, in a brothel in Haida Pakala and at the sixth junction of any road that itself is the sixth junction of another road.

The path through the Valley of the Pearl Mists is long and winding and beset with dangers. It is advisable to make sacrifices to Pohán, Sage of Lost Cities, Nrásh, The Observer of All the World, Kakán, and if you can find the secret shrines, the Pearl Grey Aspects of Thúmis before setting forth on this journey.

According to legend Dénggur was originally a mortal man, a sage of Thúmis who knew Pavar himself, and sought to emulate his god by finding a vantage point from which he could observe all the planes of all the universes simultaneously from above, below, the grél and chío-wards.

Thúmis saw the hubris in his soul and sent many messages and warnings to Dénggur not to waste his talents in seeking out a goal only the Gods themselves could make use of, but he persisted and eventually found the mountain of Nrásh and climbed it. At the peak he stopped and looked out and he saw ALL. Thus he gained his one demonic power of Pansophism, knowledge of all that transpires, and became rooted to the spot by despair and desolation at the knowledge that flooded into his mind.

Those who follow his path should stop short of this mountain peak on the ledge known as Dénggur’s Step and shout their questions to the sage through the thick clouds that ring the lower portions of the peak. One must listen carefully for his reply among the many echoes of ones own voice, the tunkul gongs of the thousand monasteries of the Mighty Ones of the Peal Mists and the tinkling of the million wind-chimes with which Dénggur attempts to assuage the mighty sorrow of his soul. However indistinct the answer do not climb further, lest you too see ALL and suffer the awful spiritual consequences of witnessing the true size of one’s own soul in relation to the universe.

If one is afflicted in such a manner then the only solution is to have one’s comrades seek the assistance of the Mighty Ones of the Pearl Mists. They have the power to remove the memory of any event, however traumatic, though they will also remove the memory of any answer that Dénggur may have given you and of the mighty sage’s appearance.
