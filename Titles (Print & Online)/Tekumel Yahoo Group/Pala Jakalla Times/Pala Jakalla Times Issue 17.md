What next, a plague on painters ?<br><br>**Huge display in the arena** is forecast to be a great success. Allegations of cheating in training by a Tinalyia ('I didn't comprehend') have led to the withdrawal of three of the amateur contestants.

This decision follows hot on the heals of the dropping of a shamtla claim against him by his own clan. The basis of the original claim appears to have been forgotten. Aren't families nice ?<br><br>**Many happy foreigners** have decended on the city this week, and the militia have had their hands full in restraining the exuberance of one or two of the more inebriated amongst them.

|**Grain prices fall by 5%**. Demand rises 2%. Shipments from foreign ports are expected to fall in response to this price drop price. Local farmers have not complained, indeed as many of them sell their rain long in advance to secure contracts with merchants they are probably very happy.

|**Governor Pro-Tem refuses to reduce the tithe** or tax element for the year, despite pleas for leniency from the confederation of local farmers. The problems with this years harvests are likely to lead to several bankruptcies. Already farm land prices have fallen 20%.

An OAL spokesman said that they were stretched in trying to suppress these before they spread further.<br><br>**Support your local legions.** Forage rules - where grain is taken without payment, as allowed in time of war or famine - may soon be introduced.

Other legions may be dispersed to farms under their own initiatives.Shock as grain prices continue to rise 100% per week. Panic buying reported. An economist from the temple of Ketenku said "This is inconceivable, Pala Jakalla is one of the nation's foremost trading centres. Where are the traders?"|
