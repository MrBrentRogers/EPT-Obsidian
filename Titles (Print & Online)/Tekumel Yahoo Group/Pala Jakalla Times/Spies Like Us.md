# 1          Gossip Sheet

**Month Zero**

**Late summer, 2365 AS**

All players will be aware of the basic matters in the first sections

**History**

The state of unrest in the South has passed peacefully.  Many believe that the naturally placid, stability biased Southerners were incapable of a serious rebellion anyway.

Over the last few months the state of unrest has lead to the replacement of many of the previous bureaucratic incumbents, and has provided an ideal opportunity for placing moles, sleepers and agents. 

The Flame Legions were withdrawn, partly under pressure from local politicians with-holding taxes, and partly due to the increasingly dangerous position in the North.  As it happens the fact that a large number of Flame Legions were near Avanthar has proven to be fortuitous for Mirusiyá...(below)

**Royalty**

The Emperor by Right, Dhitchuné, is having a bit of trouble with his brother Mirusiyá, who doesn't accept the results of the Kolumeljalim.  Whilst nobody in the region would lift a finger to help Dhitchuné their stability bias inclines them to believe that Mirusiyá is not quite playing by the rules.  The locals were really rather upset when the Temple of Thumis revealed their Princely candidate and he was killed off within two rounds.

Emperor Dhitchuné is currently believed to be leading an enormous army to assault the city of Fasiltum, where his brother, the usurper Mirusiyá, was thought to be hiding.  The siege is not going at all well for the Worm Lord and his cronies.  Unsubstantiated rumour has it that his troops are wearing rather old and grubby armour and prefer to manoeuver at night.

Dhitchuné's troops are known to have routed at least four cohorts of Red Devastation in their initial advance on the city.  The Flame temples are in uproar all over the Empire at the loss of the standard of the second cohort.  They are even more upset that the body of Zhanra hiVriddi, the Standard Bearer, has not been returned to his clan.  Many other bodies are missing.

The very latest word is that Mirusiyá has shown up with a respectable force at the very gates of Avanthar and is, even now, preparing to launch an assault.  How he escaped from the siege of Fasiltum is the source of intense discussion.  The favoured theory is that he travelled the Pathways of Glory in the realm of the demon lord Metallja.  A less favoured theory is that he took an air car over the walls under cover of darkness and shielded by his most powerful sorcerers; this is less popular as it is not really a 'noble action' to sneak out of siege.

Lady Main Kruthain, who last week was said to have killed herself in despair, is now thought to be raising troops and magical cohorts somewhere near Beý Sý.  It is also said that she is frantic about a missing part of The Serpent that Devours its own Tail, which is some sort of magical device.  (She is heading for lady kamira Tlakotani's place at this very moment.)

**Local folk**

Two weeks ago Uroquel hiChankolel, formerly a major in the Legion of the Mighty Prince disappeared, with his 13 year old son, Makaru and 7 year old daughter Thi'ari.  He was in disgrace for speaking out against the Emperor Dhitchuné.  A missing person notice has been posted for him and a man known only as Nimuel who is believed to have been aiding his disappearence. (He has fled to the country, and is keeping a very low profile.  His disgrace is a source of both pride and shame to his fellow officers))

Midori Ito is said to be returning from his studies, poor but happy.  He has a new wife and a baby son.  He has also gained a second renu.  There will probably be a party at his country house, 'The Seat of the Moon Zirunel', which is near the Palace Of The Moon on the river.  There is much hilarity caused by his new neighbour, Nirdel hiVordesa of Golden Sunburst who is a noted reactionary and campaigner for higher moral standards.  (In a few weeks Nirdel hiVordesa sells to Upnarpishden hiNirgai at a low.  The new owner was not told of the 'strange smells and noises' that frightened off poor Nirdel)

Lord Eshmar hiSayuncha of the Golden Bough Clan has lately entered the Court of Purple Robes - almost the only non-Change worshipper to do so. His is a very prestigious branch of the Sayuncha family. His three sons are Mathan (25 yrs), Borreka (21) and Gisun (18) and his daughter is Ushanai (17). They all live in Hekellu with Eshmar's first wife, Lady Yuna'in, who is the mother of Mathan and Borreka.  Mathan, a noted roue, until recently held a post in the Palace of War.  Now he has been assigned to the Legion of the Mighty Prince - which, because of the family's great prestige, he is joining as a Major.  He is married with one 8-year-old son. For the last couple of months he has been accompanied by his drinking companion, a scarred warrior of the Legion of Serqu called Zrivar, who wears a mask and speaks with an odd accent.

The Temple of Ksarul is building a small new wing.  None know why, and fewer would want to find out why the walls are so thick.  Co-incidentally Kurshetl hiSsanmirin may be back soon from the remote mountain seminary he retreated to last year.  (The release of several of the wards, through the agency of crashing a spaceship into the blue room was a novel solution to the problem.  Ksarul can now be seen in his torpor, by peering through a glassy portal.  He is a man!  Gruganu has been more fully empowered and has been seen walking the earth in one of several guises.  The temple of Ksarul is in a frenzy of new works, and filled with a zeal not seen in two thousand years)

**The Weather**

It has been unseasonably stormy of late, with torrential rains in summer and violent winds from the North.  It has been so bad that crops are expected to be affected.  Indeed only last week the Green Forest Clan petitioned the Governor for relief from taxes as they need to repland many square tsan of fruit and nut orchards to the North of the city.

**Concerning The Law Courts**

The cases are posted on a large board outside the relevant court building.  The extended details can be gleaned by hanging around and listening to the gossip for a kiren or two.

**Court  Cases Pending:**

**The First Appellate Court**

          the suing of shamtla from Kruom hiArkodu (Standing Stone Clan -H; a patriarch of Qon) who called Lord Vurrighend Khekhessa (of the Royal clan of Heru, W. Salarvya; a Lord Adept of Thumis who is visiting Jakalla to glean certain facts from the Necropolis) a slave and an idiot during a conversation whose full details neither wish to expose.

**The Court of Ten Pillars**

          the alleged murder of Huketlayu hiViridame of the Cloak of Azure Gems (VH) by Ta'ana hiRi'inyussa of the Golden Sunburst Clan (VH).  He had purportedly raped her and a five-day later was set upon by three seeming Livyani slaves in the Feasting Room of his clan.  They killed each other before being taken by the clan guards, but had been seen in the company of one of Ta'ana's slaves the day before.

**The Court of Thirteen Pillars**

          the trial of Elulen hiDanolel of the Slavers Clan of the Silver Anklet has been bought forward at the request of the Department of Commissioners.  She has apparently withheld some 200,000 Kaitars of Taxable monies from the Imperial Tax collectors (or did she refuse to supply a particularly winsome slave-girl to the expropriating official who had conceived a lust for her?).

**The Court of Pleadings**

          the theft of an iron Engsvanyali Sword, 1000 golden Suor and an amulet of carnelian from the tomb of the Clan of the hiSSankolun lineage of the Clan of Sea Blue.  These materials were found in the possession of Fyerik hiBanthadtha of the Clan of the Scarlet Planet of Knives before he disappeared with them.  His clan is now being sued by the Clan of Sea Blue, although it claims that he was murdered by the Clan of Sea Blue and his new-found treasures confiscated by them.

          the exact dispersal of the possessions of Meshmuyel hiAmnu'a of the clan of the Red Stone (H) who left riches of 730,000 K after his death of a surfeit of Tsuhoridu.  Two wills exist, the older having a codicil which is more recent than the newer will, but which cuts out his clan and gives the money to his temple and his third wife's clan (the Dark Water, H), where he was living at the time of his death

**Other events concerning the law courts**

          A dispute over a will following the death of Trimnesh hiLangsha of the Scroll of Wisdom clan (M), a free-lance jurist who had done very well indeed in the 2nd Appellate Court some ten or more years ago.  His elder daughter now practises there but does not have his knack for choosing the more lucrative cases.

## 2         

## Other Events

**Concerning the other departments of the Palace of The Realm**

These items will only be known to people of relatively high status, and lower status players are unlikely to now more than the first sentence of each case.

          the registration of quadruplets, twice in a month, by members of the Flowering Life Clan (L).

          the disappearance of Zaren hiBalam of the Clan of the Purple Gem (H), a young up-and-coming bureaucrat who has not been seen for a month.  He was quiet, unassuming and utterly boring.  Has he been murdered? kidnapped? become addicted to Zu'ur or Tsuhoridu?  Has he fallen madly in love with some foreign lady and followed her home to a distant land (giggles).

          the promotion of Chargesh hiSsandagash of the Clan of the Plume of White (L) to the rank of Senior Scribe (circle 9) in the Department of the Third Courtyard.  This is an unheard-of rank for one of his lowly background.  His sly ways and unctuous manner should have prevented his promotion to such an august post. Did he blackmail somebody?  [He had been very involved in the Clan of the Azure Gem's lawsuit against the son of a senior OAL official, which, much against expectations, was settled in their favour.]

          the assumption of Aridani status by Elena hiSsankolun of the Clan of Sea Blue will be held in two days time: the cooks are preparing a great feast and you can smell the aromas if you just walk down the corridor over there.  Her mother is a Tlakotani from upriver - and ugly as a chlen-beast!  Prince Rereshqala might be coming!

          the attempt to trace Meshmuyel hiTengetlaku of the Clan of the Red Sword (-H), who had fled Jakalla with a tax debt of 25,000K (massive due to fines for non-payment) seems to have traced his flight to Heru in Salarvya.  He personally insulted the Grand Sequestrator, Count Chushel hiSsanmirin, arranging for the display of a Meshqu plaque denoting engagement with a Chlen (the Badge of Expression of Animalistic Passion - described in the Paean of Psankothoth of Nirukkai) outside his apartment door.  The resulting arousal of hilarity within his clan severely discomfited the Grand Sequestrator in a manner hitherto unseen since his first wife left him for a tattooed Livyani.

          the constant presence of Messiliu Giyo, a Mu'ugalavyani potter, seeking to evade taxation on an antique vase found amongst his wares by the inspectorate.  Its value far exceeded that of the rest of his stock and, he claims, was stolen by thieves after the inspection.  He claims that the resulting levy of taxes will utterly beggar him.  He further claims that it was not his, having been planted amongst his goods by those thieves the previous day - he knows not why.

### So What Did The Characters Actually Do?

The players introduced themselves, but the GM failed, as usual, to learn their names.

Lisa is a dancer, with a fair degree of skill in other matters which will become clear to the players in good time.  She took on her first real role, with three assistants, at a soiree thrown to celebrate the assumption of Aridani status by Elena hiSsankolun of the Clan of Sea Blue paid for by her father Botokanish.  (The only one in the family with any income, as opposed to assets)

Lisa has signed on with an agent and found a nice little flat for digs.  Her land-lady is Niyel hiNashoma, Amber Cloak and Aridani, 25 years old and a painter.  The option of learning to paint has been advanced.  The evening job was a qualified success, as one of the team suffered a nasty fall in the wings, but she has been noticed - well, she is a dancing N'luss.

Duncan, playing Turu'Kyn Slmar, a drop dead good looking Livyani woman of high clan and beaurocratic inclination, has taken the job of assistant to Vrishmuyal hiPureshke of Sea Blue.  With racial maximum looks she spends much of her time using make up to reduce her appearance bonus!

Tom has taken a very cleverly concealed role as a market 'import export merchant' with years of experience and a string of references.  In the first week he managed to move his pitch forward by four rows!  (A little discrete bribery to Chargesh hiSsandagash of the Clan of the Plume of White (L) just promoted to the rank of Senior Scribe (circle 9) in the Department of the Third Courtyard...and in dire need of cash to support his new role!)

Mark has a real luvvie of an actor.  The Department of the Twelve Pillars are going to need to expand the city gates to let his ego in and out!  He also took a job at the soiree, where he made a bit hit with everyone except the major domo.  (Who hates all actors after his daughter ran away with one last year)  Mark has also proved to have many talents in disguise, and is perceptive enough to be the first person to spot the cell master, though he didn't know it until later.

**What else they heard**

At the soiree they learned that Botokanesh does not really approve of his daughter's assumption of Aridani status, and is intent on ridiculing her.  Fortunately her mother,  Kamira the ugly Tlakotani, is everything her father is not.  It took a while to dawn on the characters that her looks were probably not entirely naturally caused, but they have not yet taken up her offer of a visit to Bey Sy.  (She is keen to ally herself with Main Kruthain, who may be able to restore her looks)

They spent the next month in splendid ignorance of each other, because a paper shortage had kept the activation signal out of the newsletters.  The cell master was going frantic, as many of his plans were unravelling in the time it took to get the message out again.  At least their covers were kept intact, none attracted unusual attention.

The delay also bought rumours to their ears:

           grain was becoming expensive and a monopoly had been sold to an unknown cartel;

           fine fruit tree and olive wood was becoming cheap (Tom made a quick killing on that, and, paradoxically made a good trading friend dispite rooking him);

           some overland travellers were arriving late due to the state of the Sakhbe roads.  Turu'Kyn is being told at work that Auvesu, the new broom at Department of Thirteen Pillars, is not up to the job and is only employed because of his Sarku connections;

           Zaren hiBalam of the Clan of the Purple Gem, the young man who disappeared, was probably chasing a girl, but as he had just walked from the Chaka's and was a fellow of the clan which is sponsoring Turu'Kyn this is not setting anyone's mind at rest.  There is more to this one, methinks;

           the news from Avanthe and Fasiltum is being supressed; the Seige of Fasiltum is continuing, with few contacts, no breaches in the wall and no major sallies by the defenders.  The assault on Avanthe was repelled, and the attackers (rumoured to be made up of the elite units of Red Devastation and Sword of Fire) driven back to the Northern Desert.  Mirusiya was not amongst the fallen.

## Month Two - The Plot Has Thickened Like Stale Chumetl

When the call to awaken came from the Cell Master (about three weeks late) there was a mixed response from the cell members. Mogs raced to his letter box, Duncan wandered along, Tom made a late start and Lisa decided that she didn't want to be a spy after all.  Only a final round up by the cell master saved the day.

The first message was for a meeting at the 'pot' letter box.  Duncan thought it meant something else entirely.  Mogs was the only one who had checked his astrological timetables, and the others would not have arrived but for a bit of gentle prompting.  (A once only offer, next time you are on your own...)

The events of the first meeting will be part of local farming folk lore for some time.

Tom arrived first, in the day light and set up a stall selling tools and cook ware.  A brilliant disguise, and fine bit of playing.  Only the fact that he stayed about four hours longer than any previous merchant set him apart.

Lisa's departure was more traumatic, as the young gate guard took a shine to her (it must be the red hair) and made her promise to come back soon.  Young Jinktesh will have a fair old wait, I feel.  Having passed that hurdle she wandered, unmolested, to the rendezvous.

Picture the scene: a rural field, a small thatched hut.  A merchant.  A dancer.  It is getting dark.  The farmers watch in interest as the dancer and the merchant studiously ignore each other for about an hour.

Luckily the hut attendent turned up about dusk and swept the place out.  This broke the silence.  Then he drifted off to hand out the serfs wages and check on the list of tasks completed.

Duncan had chosen a more conspicuous exit, taking a small group of metrologists to check on the available supplies of fine woods released by the storms, and to do a quick, and sureptitious, check on the condition of the sakhbe road.  Having left the assistents behind, it was time for a quick change and a cross country jog.

Mogs had taken a more adventurous route - out over the city wall in full kit.  A combination of extreme luck and good general perception avoided the trip wires, guards and physical alarms on the city wall.  Even Pala Jakalla employs defences, and in turbulent times there are certain to be many more, both seen and unseen.

Mogs arrived, invisible and tip toe silent, and secreted himself under the bench in the hut.  (Having decided not to hide in the pile of root vegetables at the back)

Duncan arrived from the same direction, followed the tip toe foot prints and climbed in under the thatch.

Tom and Lisa, having got bored of the whole thing, opened the hut door to read the message in the pot.  The fading dusk light revealed Duncan, knife in hand, and Mogs under the bench.  There was a breathless pause: was this the OAL?  Had we all lost our minds?  How quickly could Duncan throw the knife?

Passwords were haltingly, and badly, called out.  the atmosphere was tense.  Then a flickering from a lantern in the far corner aborted the nascent combat.  "I am silver".

## Fast forward to the next scene.

A partly abandoned Jade Diadem lodge about a tsan down the road.

Every one goes off to bed, with the promise of a proper briefing in the morning.

About three kiren after midnight a rowdy bunch of would be bandits take ove the lodge, finding it empty.  The cell has decamped to the roof void, with just cramp, bugs and tiredness for company.

The bandits leave, to do unspeakable harm to a passing merchant, around dawn.  The players follow on in the bushes behind

**(more next week)**

## Plot notes for the GM

**The Brigands**

The brigands will jump the merchant's party from behind, throwing short spears at 10 metres (assume +50) and running in with shield whilst drawing swords.  Assume they get first hack after closing as the others will be 'dozing'.

|**K'ng**|50||||||
|**Otan**|50||||||
|**Disu**|45||||||
|**Mara**|45||||||

Varamu is obviously the leader as he is taller, fitter, has a large scar, doesn't appear to panic, orders from the rear, and runs away when it all gets too tough, using an Eye of Returning Unto Safety on a thong around his neck.

He will try to wrestle the pouch off the merchant and zap the eye on round three, if he escapes what then ????

Check SD each time one of the others is killed or disabled.

Possessions:

|**Name**|**Possessions**|
|**Varamu**|Eye of Returning Unto Safety, three charges, one tsan range, 10% chance of terminal error, focussed on small copse near village.<br><br>4 Kaitars.  Good chlen sword. Modest armour.  Amulet of blue stone in shape of Avanthe, Bringer of Harvests, 5K|

**The Merchant**

Nashme hiKhamtai of Dark Water, travelling with two paid guards, is carrying letters of credit to Masunel hiAuvesu, his cousin by marriage and current in charge of Road Maintenance in Hallway of Twelve Columns.  He has been told these are to bribe Meshmuyal hiVrazhimy the boss of HTC.

If rescued he will spill the beans about his well placed cousin's lucky deals on the grain futures.  He will hint that there is a scam going on with the supporters of Dhitchune trying to win more influence.  He will offer to cut any Dark Trinity members in on the deal, once he knows what it is.

If he is killed, or the pouch is stolen there will be enough scraps of paper to put the story together.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Name**|**Possessions**|
|**Nashme**|Rich clothes, size 12, letters of credit personalised to Masunel hiAuvesu for 28,763 K (far too large for a bribe!!!) Letter in Tongue of the Worm Lord (safe passage) 55K in cash, modest chlen short sword.|
|**Hastek**|Bronze sword, good armour, good shield, 20K, poultice that acts as G1 healing|
|**Mrikten**|Bronze sword, good armour, good shield, 7K, Hneku weed, painting of wife and two children.|

## After the battle?

The players will stumble across the hideously mangled bodies of three 'hard' Salarvyani enforcers, Tom will have seen them running a little extortion in the market for a local slaver clan.  They have been stripped, mutilated and infected with maggots (roll to detect not natural?)

This could be on the way to bury their own victims, or on the way back....more next week.

## Black Marks

         Any witnesses left cause OAL to investigate within two weeks

         If Nashme returns to Masunel hiAuvesu then Temple of Sarku will send a visitor to each player within two nights

         Any tracks not cleared up will lead to trouble next time the players come this way, say a few militia guards on more alert patrol

         Bodies not fully hidden lead to wanted posters - any player who fumbles a dex * general perception check has left a small clue behind.

         If Lisa is not back through the gate by sunset a patrol will be sent, with a 50% chance of finding her by the next sunset

         The 'pot' dead letter box will be watched from now on because of the antics of the players.

# So guess what happened!

The players utterly slaughtered the bandits, although they were taken by surprise by the fact that they were on the wrong side of the road to get a first strike on the evil-doers.  The other thing that fooled them was the bandits playing rather too intelligently, which allowed Varamu to return unto safety, with half of the pouch.

The players left the bodies all over the road, presumably as a welcome mat for Richard's new character.  I was a little amused that they tried to leave them there over night to attract additional attention.

While they were resting at the lodge they discovered that the sad old duffer who as doing the cleaning was also cleaning up as an informant to the OAL.  Sadly he is no longer available for employment on this plane.  In terms of player effort they used more spell points de-lousing themselves than in removing their tracks.

Silver returned to help them out, and showed them where Varamu had gone.  On arrival in his village they found that he was already dead (in flagrante with his underage neice), and her body was looking very fetching in an enchanted necklace.  In return for removing the 'bad vibes' the players also removed the necklace.  Using it as a hi-tech slinky toy gave us all a few minutes giggles.

Back to town, by separate paths.  Lisa just made it in time, but has a date at the gate if she wishes.  Mogs decided to go through the gate rather than over the wall.

A few quiet days passed.  The town filled up with Salarvyani 'merchants', all of who have callouses on the base of their thumbs.  Grain became scarcer.  Chlen carts hard to come by.  Prices rise.  Pirates become more daring.  Bandits get closer to the city.  The sahkbe becomes more difficult to use, through weight of traffic and poor repair.

## And then: they blow their cover and run for it.

Lisa was pleased to receive an invitation to dance for lady Kamira Tlakotani and her daughter, Elena.  Mogs thought it would be fun, but was really enjoying his new job as town crier (especially as he was the first person to read the news about the upcoming Kolumeljalim), and Bey Su is such a long way to go.  Tom saw a quick buck to be made.  Duncan saw, in Elena, a woman to be conquered.  Richard was asleep.

The way that Vridekka showed up at the temples of the Dark Trinity in Pala Jakalla upsaet the players. Perhaps it was the way he had made an impossibly fast journey by palanquin, perhaps it was the sheer co-incidence of the glance he gave to Tom near the gate, or may be it was the dead bodies of the butcher and a flat mate in Lisa's room.  Vridekka's boys have never heard the phrase 'don't kill the messenger'.

Whatever possessed Lisa to grab the butchers bags, we'll never know; but she came up trumps.  Silver had sent over his eye's and charms secreted in a heart, and wrapped in a magic defeating metal foil (copy right Mu-metal industries Inc.).

This took them a while to suss out, but they got there in the end.  Shortly after this it was agreed mutually to take a trip to the country, for a little R&R near Bey Su.

## Entry to the Secret Book

How much did Vridekka know?  Was it just co-incidence?  Did Vridekka's men enchant the eyes for their own purposes?  Did the butcher squeal?  Who noticed the sudden departure of the whole bunch of people?  More next week....

## Cruising to Bey Su

The barge capitain was happy to take on a few paying passengers, especially when he screwed them over the fare.  He was even happier to take Tom's cargo.

The rooms were basic, but clean, and the barge was large enough to be stable and smooth.

Had the players offered to pay just a little more to the crew, or stopped the bosun nicking the crews share then they could have avoided the 'pirate' mugging that the crew got from the porters.  Still, the players killed them in about three rounds, and then took about ten rounds to realise that the crew must be incapacitated.  I was pleased with the 'no morale checks, no pain, extra skill' bracelet for the leader of the 'pirate-wanabees'.  I was really pleased with the little fish tattoos that bound the 'pirates' into a team.  All that for nothing.  Next time it is wardings, retributions and serious armour!

## Poison

The crew were poisoned, but the players did get the anti-dote from the nearest village.  Mogs used his honorary Messengers Guild badge (from being town crier) to get the early news off a part drowned runner.  Attacked by a Tsoggu!  Just three days south of Bey Su!  (Actually it was a Shedra, and the messenger had made the fatal mistake of stopping at Kamira's place for refreshment the day previously.  His pouch was empty, but the Shedra didn't know that).

Early news: Dra prince revealed.  Sarku troops massing in North, facing north.  Hirkane's ghost seen in Golden Tower.  Muglarvyani take Chaka's from Pe Choi.

## Arrival

Having avoided death through nerve gas as Richard tried to clear out the rats, (Moral: check how big the cloud is next time), they arrived at Kamira's.  Accomodation was not what Duncan expected, as they were restricted to outside the walls.  All except Duncan apreciated that the Aridani Legion of Lady Mrissa was more important.

Main Kruthain arrived in the night.  Lisa caught a peek through a screen.

## Next week

Breakfast is good.

Lord Jaikami Ito arrives with his entourage, and the Tears of Hrihiyal.

The players learn about the huge split in the temples, Ksarul partly freed, Gruganu walking the earth, Shiringayi revealed as antecedent to Avanthe and Dlamelish, treaties with Livyanu and Pechano.  Rumours that Dhitchune tried to kill Miridobu and Tengetlaku.

Lunch doesn't arrive.  The players are searched, disarmed, interogated, locked in make shift cells

Lisa gets to dance, if she wants.  Mogs can introduce her.

Mihallu arrive with glowing sphere, seen only by those in the cells.  Half dead guard gets keys in to the players so they can free themselves.  Armour, weapons, etc. hard to find.

Can they save the night?  Will the bomb go off?  (No, it is a gate way to let in a squadron of undead troops)

What do the Tears Of Hrihiyal and the Serpent That Devours Its Own Tail do?

Where is Silver?

## Lord Jaikamu

Arrives, leaves rumours, the Tears, and Kali'Etsu'Darusti.  She is a young girl, petite, finely featured, slightly paler and closer to modern Japanese than the arabic/idigene norm for Tsolyani.  She also wears a loose fitting shift and trousers.  Just to ensure that she really sticks out she is bald!  If anyone looks beyond the skin, it is obvious that she is wasting away and is probably terminally ill.

She is taken to one side by Abasudste hiMeshi, and they are not seen until the evening.

(She is very, very ancient.  She has been recovered from stasis by Jaikamu, and is here to assist with the evening.  She has memories Back to the time of No Kings.  She knows of the original sundering of the powers of Hrihiyal and Avanthe from the proto goddess 'Shiringayi'. form.  She has an inkling that the goddess is also a woman who transcended at the Time of Darkness)

## In the Hall

The hall is large, airy and painted in blue, green and white pastels.  It is almost devoid of statuary and carving, although there are lots of exposed wood beams, exquisite vases full of flowers, exotic orchids and heady scents.  The cool clear sound of a fountain outside can be heard, mingling with the crystal sound of wind chimes.

The pc's will enter from the rear of the hall, and can peer around the screens that form the wings.

The stage is a simple wooden roundel, raised about a hand-span off the floor.  It is strewn with flowers, rushes, and wild herbs.  (An acute observer would spot the fine silt and drops of blood and semen mingling with fresh vresh paste and ash).

Around the stage are six silver chalices, covered and polished.  The age is obvious as the polishing has, over time, buffed out all the very early Engsvanyali / Shiringayi detail.

Three daises have been laid out.  The left is occupied by Lady Kamira, her other two adopted daughters (Qaresu and Diomedhi, both in their teens, veiled and under orders to keep quiet!), a woman (Obispu hiBurutla of Jade Diadem) (short, dark, overly made up, could be 55?) who is introduced as a physician and the major domess (?) (previously met).

None are wearing jewellery.

The right is occupied by five high officers of the Aridani legion of Lady Mrissa:  Gamelu hi Utekh (Sea Blue) (37, tall, mousey, athlethic attractive and quick witted), Hostikh hi Tumine (Might of Ganga) (41, tall, very dark, nervous, very well dressed), Marissikh hi Tsugaru (Jade Diadem) (33, average height, pale, top heavy, relaxed, charming), Nyari hi Vriyen (Jade Diadem) (32, average height, dark, androgenous, reserved) and Chaimiri hi Chaishyani (Golden Sunburst) (27, tall, stocky, pale and interesting, cropped hair, loud and laughing).

They are in evening wear, and unarmed.  All weaponry has been consigned to outside the door.  There are no men in the room.

The centre table is occupied by the princess Main Kruthain (no desciption necessary), Abasudaste hiMeshi (see sheet), Elena hi Ssankolun (previously encountered) and Main's two 'assistants' (slim, silent, alert, still).  There is a sixth place set at this dais, but no imperial seal.

The conversation is animated.  It is clear that Main Kruthain is very nervous, exhausted and perpetually on the verge of either tears or rage.  She is listening to Elena prattle on about the Kolumeljalim.  Every now and again she interjects with comments:

"It is all irrelevant" ... "Greater powers than the worm have been stirred into this stew" ... "Dhitchune has no idea of the problems he has caused".

Suddenly Elena gets up, looks ashen and flees the room.  Abasudaste has been whispering in her ear.  Main rounds on Abasudste, who replies "She was not a worthy vessel, my lady.  She was less careful last night than she knew."   Main slumps forwards with her head in her hands, despairing.  Her 'assistants', in a surprisingly tender gesture, place hands on her shoulders.

Kali'Etsu'Darusti enters from the main doors.  She is being held up by two slaves, almost unable to walk now.  She is placed into the seat by Main Kruthain.  "All is ready, my lady" she croaks.  The necklaces, now intertwined in a fantastical helix, slip from her fingers.

## Vridekka's orders:

**Know that:**

The people you went to see in Pala Jakalla have been seen on a river boat.  They have arrived at Lady Kamira Tlakotani's estate.  Our agent does not know what thay carry.  Assume they have it.

Lord Jaikamu hiSsanmirin has, once more, evaded the worms in the catacombs, and is making good time on foot to offer the _'girl who was born before time'_ to Main Kruthain.  Are you sure that your sending of sickness can kill her soon enough?

**My desires are:**

         Disarm my Royal Sister, the Lady Main Kruthain, but do not injure her body.

         Remove her assistants.

         Destroy the _Tears Of The Goddess_.

         Bring the _Serpent That Devours Its Own Tail_ to me.

**Action!**

Contact the Six Devoted Mihalli and arrange for them to take the Wonderous Portals of Srukarum to the house of Lady Kamira Tlakotani.

Take fifty Warriors of the Legions of the Dead through the portal.  I am sending ten of my best Shedra to assist you, and two of the Royal Family of the Dead.  The two Jadgi have orders to keep the Wonderous Portal open for your return.  You may not risk them.

I will await you in the pass, north of Bey Su, on the way to Thri'il.  We will not be opposed on the path to the Mighty City Without Death!

May the Iron Reaper send our enemies to the Tenebrious Places!  Otulenbga!  Victory!

(Jack - you may chose to drop this when you leave)

## The men

As a security precaution everyone will be disarmed during the ceremony.  Arms, and indeed most metallic objects, will be placed in boxes near the doors to the main rooms, watched by a low rank legionary.

The men, except Lisa's dresser, will be placed under temporary protective custody.  In the case of Lisa's dresser he can only remain if he agrees to submit to a temporary mind-bar from Abasudaste that restrains any action which is harmful to lady Main Kruthain, the godesses Avanthe or Dlamelish, or their servants for a period of one day.

This protective custody will be in the undercroft, where bronze grills separate three large 'cells', hastily emptied of fine wines, spices and linens.

Ms Sl'mar will be invited to watch the ceremony...unless she is foolish enough to attract the attention of any professional guard or sorceror; in which case she will be incarcerated without ceremony!

## The Mihalli

The Mihalli, six of them, will transport themselves via the other planes, to a point as close to the undercroft of the main hall as possible.  By an unfortunate co-incidence this is where the the Aridani Legion of Lady Mrissa are holding all the men during the ceremony.

The six Mihalli will take on the guards with magic as soon sa they casn (see sheet )

They will attempt the following:

1.         Disempower, slow, degrade, sap the guards (etc)

            the four guards start to move in, they slow down, look stricken, their armour dulls, the swords droop as if wax, they look enfeebled...

2.         Favour themselves (etc)

            the mihalli glow brightly, appear strong and healthy.  The first guards get a half action at end of round, what little damage they do is healed instantly

3.         Amorphia / Deliquesce any attackers

            the guards are destroyed horribly, the last guards is left with only part of one leg and no facial features.  Stumbling blindly, she collapses against the bars.

They will then begin the ritual.  A glowing sphere begins to pulse a dull ochre colour suffusing it.  A stench fills the room.  A deep low moan can be heard.

The keys are in the guards hand!

Whatever the escapees do, remember this:

the only real weapons are upstairs

the only items to hand are wooden, or glass

the Mihalli will simply evaporate in five more rounds

## THE VRUNEB

## or

## Life During Peacetime

## Team members

The traditional vruneb cell has seven members and a cell master.  This may, of course be varied.  The members take on specific roles and are assigned appropriate code names in general correspondence.  The activity code is based on the cell being like a tiny dri-ant, toiling ceaselessly for the home nation.  The role name is used interchangeably with any other identity.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**activity**|**typical cover**|**code**|
|courier|merchant, traveller, dispatcher, sailor|legs|
|quartermaster|armourer, merchant, alchemist|stomach|
|enforcer|militia, warrior, labourer|jaws|
|researcher|official, student, priest|head|
|social observer|official, student, priest, dilettante, courtesan|nose or ears|
|military observer|militia, warrior, official|eyes|
|trade observer|official, student, merchant|chest|

Of these one will usually be an internal enforcer, reporting on the other to the cell master.  The cell will know that there is such a person, but not who it is.

The quartermaster will usually be able to get items and equipment at trade prices, which are 10 to 50 percent less than retail.  He or she will be able to have things shipped in from abroad, and will be responsible for maintaining the off-base caches and emergency supplies for escape and evasion.

The courier will, of necessity have pre-arranged identities and travel documents for most local destinations, and is often held out to be of reasonably high clan, as this assists in movement in the Tsolyani Empire.

## Activation

Cells take several months, if not years, to put into place, and are generally held inactive until a certain coded message is received.

The activation code for this cell is "his son, last month, in Khirgar"

If the phrase is received the cell members should place their coloured thread in each of the dead letter boxes.  When all have been visited they should await delivery of instructions and new code books.

## Identifying friends

Q:         didn't I meet you at the birth party for Dorash hi Bitokoti's child?

A:         was that his son or daughter

R:         how greatly he has been blessed with robes of [my identity colour is]

C:         and his wife wore [my identity colour is].

If captured the enemy should be told that the colour is gold.  The mention of gold, or its use in other codes or messages, will alert the others.

## History

The cell members have not, to their knowledge, met yet.  They were recruited and trained in a variety of locations, and may have worked in other places before.  They were rushed into position in Pala Jakalla in the last three weeks.  They will barely have had time to settle down.

## Skills

In addition to the usual stuff spies get another 10 development points per level whilst in training.  They are required to have at least four levels in each of the following skills, which are specific to their profession:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Skill**|**Type**|**Cost**|
|Trade craft|Academic|1/5|
|Code and Cipher Use|Academic|2/5|
|Sabotage|General|1/5|
|Escape and Evade|Perception|2/5|

They will have been encouraged to develop:

         unarmed combat skills (remember these are very rare in Tekumel, so add 1 point to any cost, i.e. 2/5 becomes 3/6)

         make-up and theatrical skills

         persuasion and public speaking

         perception skill

         falsification skills

         local knowledge and survival

In addition, in the year before they are placed in the field they receive an extra 25 development points to spend on the skills most relevant to their roles, such as trader, warrior, academic, etiquette...

It is generally better to play down one's skills when in the field.

Players are reminded that all income they earn, above that needed to sustain their cover and pay taxes, must be remitted to the quarter master.  The final definition of necessary expense rests with the cell master!

## Basic kit

All will have the following basic equipment

         About 100 K of personal items and clothing

         Sealed 100 K in gems and credit for use only in emergency

         Code book

         Writing set

         False ID

         Suicide pill

In addition the quarter master will be able to provide the basic uniforms, social attire and standard travel items at good discounts.

## Code Sheet

Each player has code words and colours, and these will be used to identify their messages:

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|**Message to**|**Role**|**Colour**|**Material / Animal**|
|The whole cell||Silver|The dri ant (nest)|
|Mogs|Legs|Red|The bird|
|Lisa,|Nose|Yellow|The fish|
|Jack||Blue|The hmelu|
|Tom|Stomach|Orange|The hma|
|Duncan|Jaws|Purple|The spider|
|Richard||Green|The bee|
|Dermot||White|The snake|

**Group dead letter boxes are as follows:**

        Tom;  one behind the daily announcements notice board at the west door of the public baths;

        Lisa;  under a loose floor board in a private booth at the wine makers clan;

        Duncan;  one under a loose stone in the wall of the shop of Kzuntori the Ssalarvyani fabric merchant;

        Mogs;  under a loose floor board in the toilet of the public area of the Department of the Third Courtyard, Palace Of The Realm;

        in a clay pot hidden in the reed thatch of a small hut used by farm labourers in the fields to the north of the city.

The use of false meshku is also common.  The cell leader will usually post these on a route which the players, or their servants use in ordinary business.  There are some distinctive features to prevent misunderstanding; they will be secured with both silver and black thread if they are to be interpreted as secret messages, and if specific to a player they will use a thread to indicate them as well.  If hung on the lower of two pegs they should be interpreted in the opposite manner.

There is a knot code, again it will be on thread which is coloured, but it must always be on a black and silver base.  If any gold is included then watch out (i.e. the sender has been captured and has told a little lie under interrogation).  The code relies on the reader finding the middle of the string, and then putting the most frayed end in their left hand.  One can then read the code by counting knots on each side.  If their is a know in the dead centre take the opposite meaning.
