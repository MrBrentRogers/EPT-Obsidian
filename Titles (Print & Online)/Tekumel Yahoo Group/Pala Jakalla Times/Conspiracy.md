**Month Zero**

Governor is appointed but happens to be in Do Chaka. Journey time of approximately 4 months anticipated.

'Make PJ Great' initiative is launched by local nobles. Faster harbour clearance, better prices, lower port handling costs, reduced warehouse costs, improved sakhbe roads, favourable duty rates and streamlined administration all promised. Federal and Imperial approval sought. Local nobles begin to send representatives to other cities.

Senior ranking clan member of Might of Ganga appointed as administrator for two weeks.

Chief Judge of PJ ( Vimuhla, very rich and respectable ) appointed Governor Pro-Tem by Imperial Warrant (? Local Elders). (All evidence of his earlier fraud (K50,000) is suppressed.)

Lists of new monopolies set out for bidding.

Persons in new posts known to support MoG are removed one by one. (Midori, etc) This is phased over the next two months so as not to be too obvious. A couple of low rank officials, especially accountants, die...

Grain monopoly awarded (to cartel controlled by Vriddi elders in Fasiltum.) ( Approx value of grain shipped into local economy, K3.5million, profits of K350 thou, on-shipped grain profits approx another K700 thou. G Pro-Tem wanted K100 thou or so for it )

Vriddi clan see this as a nice way of recouping some of their expenses of suppressing the little insurgency last year. Tacit Imperial approval for a little bit of price manipulation is given, provided all taxes are levied on any profits normally.

Cartel buys up 'a' futures in foreign ports at current price plus 20%. Many happy foreigners.

Road repairs to the upper tier of the sakhbe road strike unexpected difficulties. This continues for a few months, further choking the local roads and smaller customs posts. A senior engineer blames the past governor for under funding vital infra structure.

Fulatom is still missing.

Huge display in the arena is a great success. Allegations of cheating by a Tinalyia ('I didn't comprehend'). Assassination attempt on a senior general is ????

(Duman the Undying uses TMD's to 'edit' the minds of the pc's.)

**Month One**

Grain prices fall by 5%. Demand rises 2%. Shipments from foreign ports fall in response to price. G Pro-Tem uses popularity to undermine MoG clan, and to begin installing cronies.

Other monopolies cause price fluctuations, mainly decreases of 1% to 10%.

Some other 'fringe' members of Vriddi and other Northern clans see a real opportunity for profits here, and begin to plan a larger scale operation.

Rumours of piracy increase, ships reported to the harbour master as due in fail to arrive. The majority are staple food and grain.

Fasiltum reports expectations of an excellent harvest, after three poor years. ( A lie, harvest will be poor to middling)

The investiture of the 'real' Governor is delayed by 1 month ( to co-incide with the arrival of the Imperial delegation which is currently doing the tour of the provinces.)

Grain prices regain their old levels.

G Pro-Tem announces changes of appointments in the legislature, mainly his old cronies.

Temple of Vimuhla buys new Tunkel Gongs. ( sponsored by cartel ).

Ma'in Kruthain passes through PJ, heading west. ( Various temples )

(Zu'ur trader/smuggler/spy attempts to influence Zorel, having tracked him down as the moxt likely survivor of the ship)

Local clans invited to support a petition to the Emperor based on the records of the Legion of Hrugga. Various factions try to create a separate legion / create a new unit of Lord of Wisdom / stop this.

**Month Two**

Shortage of chlen and chlen carts begins to be noticed, no obvious reason found. (They are being bought to ship grain to Fasiltum)

Reports begin to come in of poor weather around the harvest, hail, rain and heavy fogs bedevil outlying areas that supply PJ and locality. ( Cartel use any excuse based on local weather to exaggerate. Paid rumour mongers get rich quick)

Grain prices leap 15% on this news.

( Other commercial vultures begin to gather )

Level of pirate activity gets worse, grain reaching PJ from foreign ports falls. ( Some grain is shipped directly up river, where prices have risen a little, but none is off loaded in PJ.) ( Vriddi and their sponsored pirates are hi-jacking shipments and sending them to Livyanu. As the captains get paid they are unlikely to complain too strongly...)

Abastudasté passes through, heads west

Party of slavers pass through ( Kidnappers ), they show a lot of interest at the docks as the last crew to charter the bireme. ( They want to track down the jewels they were using as a lure)

G Pro Tem appoints an official investigation into the new legion petition. Of the 15 senior historians used, drawn from a variety of backgrounds, and seen to be eminently fair, 10 are over 60. The investigation is predicted to take 5 years.

Thalocain is implicated in a practical joke which goes horribly wrong, resulting in the deaths of an architect, a foreigner, a recently bankrupt grain merchant and a junior OAL officer( Who got too close to the cartel). He skips town. ( He is innocent, as he will try to explain before he leaves. His box of tricks is left to Asrenaté)

**Month Three**

Start of harvest.

Customs duty collections are falling ( as piracy rises and shipments by-pass PJ with grain, headed for other cities.)

Hluttrugu activity hots up as the weather gets cooler and wetter, several nasty clashes with small local detachments. Farmers killed. Harvest disruption reported.

Grain prices rise another 5%.

Patchy harvest reported in this area. Better harvests elsewhere. ( Lack of carts slows the efforts of clans to ship grain in.)( Long delays noted in trying to clear caravans through Sakhbe road stations and customs posts)

(Grain begins to flow up towards Fasiltum, being over-landed to rivers and then shipped )

Sudden spate of attacks on the silos of major grain factors. Hluttrugu despoil the stored grain, often leaving silo roofs ablaze. Rain damage increases damage.

(Characters come out of training around now)

Human bandits make separate attacks, believed to be supplying grain to the black economy. Some groups of bandits appear highly organised. (The Vriddi again)

Unfounded rumours of soldiers seen harvesting grain or escorting caravans of heavy carts. (Mainly flame legions)

Grain prices rise by 100% over the next week.

Grain Futures ( 'B' futures offered for sale at current prices plus 50% ) ( Mostly, but not only, by cartel)

Kidnap attempt on Ma'in Kruthain.

Boat crew reappear at Jakalla. Thanks given by temple of Avanthé. Crew demand shamtla, hazard pay, extended duty pay and criminal charges against certain nobles.

Kengitlen's family appear to seek advice as to why their son has left home and not been seen in the last three months. Small reward offered.

**Month Four**

Foreign suppliers appear to have been caught out by selling the vast majority of their stocks on grain 'a' futures three months ago ( to the cartel, at, what was then, excellent prices ). They can't back out, because they face 200% damages, and a loss of 'honour', on the deals. (Delivery of the grain on the foreign deals is always to up-river ports, never PJ or J.)

Resentment builds in PJ. A few local farmers are singled out for hoarding, or similar offences.

(characters may be asked to investigate one or two cases)

G Pro-Tem refuses to reduce the tithe or tax element for the year. Temple land owners are blamed for putting food in store, or passing it to legion supplies rather than selling.

Local legions step up training in the PJ area, thereby worsening the situation as soldiers eat more local grain.

Prices continue to rise 100% per week, driven by less by speculation and more by desperation now.

"Avanthe's Curse" movement ( sponsored by the architects and builders clans in Thumis camps) demands Ditlana, claiming famine is the revenge of the gods for overweaning pride and laziness.

Real bread riots begin. OAL stretched in trying to suppress these.

A few stability legions institute 'forage rules' -grain is taken without payment as allowed in time of war or famine- Generals claim this is the only way to feed troops as the Imperial stipend cannot cope with current prices. Other legions are dispersed to farms under their own initiatives. (Although Flame legions aren't actually hungry they will join in quite quickly)

Larger reward placed by clan for information on the whereabouts of Kengitlen.

Player's interviewed by Kengitlen's clan's lawyer. ( N'dalu )

Players are approached by a senior member of the temple of Sarkú, who is willing to forget all claims and grudges, and arrange for certain payments in items, in return for the party doing a little discrete investigation on one or two local merchants. (some of the fringe members of the cartel)

**Month Five**

Imperial delegation arrives earlier than expected. Large Karakan force accompanies them.

G Pro-Tem declares Imperial disaster, and announces the distribution of K200 thou to grain factors as an incentive to sell current stocks early. ( only K 150 thou is actually distributed, and most of that to Cartel members. )

Prices stabilise temporarily

Prices begin to creep up again.

( N'dallu arrive, sponsored from Dlamelish in Jakalla, begin to investigate )

Governor said to be a week away up the Sakhbe road.

Gangasa clan informed that certain accounting irregularities noted by the Imperial delegation are legally the responsibility of the holder of the office, and that they may wish to provide their clan member with funds to correct the deficiencies. (K60,000)

Locals leave city in packs to raid granaries. (Empty)

G Pro-Tem is suddenly taken ill. Several highly respected doctors declare a rare condition aggravated by damp air, and recommend that he retire at once to Mu'uglavya.

G Pro-Tem leaves with a small entourage, in the middle off the night.

Pro-tem officials in harbour, road, farming, and distribution posts retire in very rapid succession.

Grain market is plunged into confusion, prices oscillate wildly by +/- 50% in the spate of a few days.

Cartel members remember certain urgent business, mostly abroad.

Duman the Undying appears to players and tries to get them to perform a transformation ritual. ( A really nice body could be available here for one of the players if they play it smart )

**Month Six**

New Governor arrives.

Grain shipments from Salarvya begin to arrive, easing shortages.

Prices begin to fall sharply on the news that relief is on its way

Cartel, and many smaller entrepreneurs, offers to deliver grain bought on 'B' futures. Extreme pressure is bought to bear on anyone who declines to pay. ( Prices will now be below the future price, and falling fast. )

Investigation launched into possible price manipulation.

Warrant issued for the arrest of Governor Pro-Tem. ( Characters employed )

Fulatom returns in the company of several other Ahoggyas, and human servants. He wishes to donate a large stock of artifacts in return for support in setting up a temple in his home swamp.

**Month Seven**

Imperial delegation declares support for the 'Make Pala Jakalla Great' initiative. Substantial aid, funding, expertise and promised. Several highly paid and very prestigious posts are offered to local notables. Growth in trade, better harbour facilities etc, all strongly supported.

All Vriddi legions withdrawn from area.Prices are given at the start and end of the month, assume compound growth each week to interpolate weekly prices.

The price of futures in grain is given for the 'a' and 'b' type here. For other trades assume that the futures price is the current price, plus interest at the local rate over the period, times the expectation factor ( average of next months prices given here, ie: 1035% if buying any future in month 3)
