Harvest is disappointing, caused by inclement weather.  The Emperor has summoned the High Priests of the temples of Avanthe and Durritlamesh to Avanthar to explain why the twenty gods have not accepted the worship and sacrifices of the loyal farmers of the South Central regions.

Petitioners for rights to trade materials with the Empires of Salarvya and Mu’uglarvya are welcomed at the Palace of Foreign lands over the next 14 auspicious days.

## Court circular

Lady Ma’in Kruthain and her entourage have returned from their summer lodge to the town house in Jakalla.  She will be visiting the temple of Avanthe at Pala Jakalla at various times over the next few weeks.  Merchants are urged not to store waste or carts in the streets approaching the temple on pain of confiscation.

## Appointments

The Governor is pleased to appoint Donmikoyel hiGangassa to the position of Senior Master of Ports and Markets.  This important and ancient post has woefully lain vacant for over 178 years, and the Governor is grateful for the diligent research of the Might of Ganga clan who have helped correct this situation.  Lord Jogesh of Standing Stone (Captain of the Market Square) and Lord Ktumii the Harbour Master will welcome Lord Donmikoyel in a private ceremony tonight.

Recently, further reinforcements to the 15th Imperial Heavy Infantry, the Legion of the Ruby Hand, has just arrived in Pala Jakalla.  As these are also worshippers of Karakan, this will doubtless sway the relative importance of these religions within the city.
