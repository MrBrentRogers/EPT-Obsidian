You are invited to join one of the temple societies, representatives of which will visit you.

**Meralokoi:**

The dagger is examined in a great deal of detail by the temple armourer priest, a certain Nigorogin hiVestiyani of the Black Knife clan. He seems perplexed at first, but then comes back to you in some excitement. He explains that the item is typical of a Milumaniyani desert clan, and usually held by shamen of those clans which worship Chiteng in his aspect of 'The parched one'.

The weapon is feeble until touched by human blood, the smallest speck will do. (* say one hit point from you *) then for one kiren the blade becomes as hard as excellent steel, for the next kiren as steel, then as chlen.

It is merely unfortunate that the first blow, after the blade has been fed, causes intense pain, rather like the Chiteng spell of punition (* T1 *).

Later that day you receive a small parcel. It contains an exquisite small necklace with the seal of the clan of the Might of Ganga on the reverse and your own glyph on the front. It is wrapped in a letter of credit for k3000, marked 'part payment of debt'. **To all budding florists,**

the plants which you had the good sense to pick need a great deal of care and attention if they are to flower again, no doubt you have noticed that the blooms are already fading.

Place in a cool spot, out of direct sunlight, but not in the dark. Water liberally in the hot months but allow to dry out in the cool season ( not that Pala Jakala has one).

Roll 5 or less on 2d10 for a bud to form each month, and d30 for the exact day. The effect is to add d6 per bloom ( maximum of two blooms ) to COME for 1 hour. No resistance roll is applicable to the effect, roll using the new COME for things like Don Juan, Courtesan, quelling mobs, etc.

A similar spell from the temple of Dlamelish is likely to go for around k1500 a shot.

In the unlikely event of you keeping it alive for a year the corm will divide to yield two potentially flowering plants. Plants die on a roll of 19 or 20 on the flowering roll.

**The scimitars of vitreous evisceration:**

These long one-handed scimitars appear to be made of a pale amber tinted glass with a fine metal tracery inside ( copper? ) and silk bound handles. They take effect as excellent steel but have -1 on any breakage rolls, and must also make a breakage roll if they ever have to take more than 20 points from an attack or parry in one go.

They do not seem to affect magic unduly. This makes them of immense value to any sorcerer, a value of k20,000 would not be unrealistic.

Incidentally they also do +1 damage if any gets through armour ( ie: +0 if parried or stopped by armour) and seem to leave wounds that take an unusually long time to heal...

The sling shot loads similarly do +1 if any gets through and always disintegrate on impact. Wounds caused by them seem to suppurate, and alleviation is recommended.

**Kurshetl:**

Your friends soon get to hear about the books that you have donated, and put a conservative estimate of k69,700 on them as a set. They disappear from the library, or at least the areas that you have access to, almost immediately. You are pleasantly surprised to find that you are credited into your temple expenses account with k23,000. Strangely your name is on the list for promotion to the next circle, although you do not recollect asking...

Tanmuruktu is keen to see you again, and explains what he has managed to surmise from the large collection of specimens that Emra provided:

The plane was probably close to Quvoye's, allowing them to draw on a little of the magic from there. They were of Llivyani origin, and judging by the artifacts and their modus operandi had spent some time in one of the shamanistic desert cultures. Their motives will remain forever unclear, although at a guess they were trying to gain the assistance of Ashonu to help them return to normal life.

The Aureous Automata had long been rumoured to exist in the southernmost regions of Llivyanu, it tended to wander freely, gathering followers and leading small armies of tribesmen for no apparent reason. It disappeared about 15 years ago. Tanmuruktu fully expects it to reappear despite your harsh treatment.

The black grain makes an excellent purgative and spargative for certain rituals, and was probably being traded for the services of minor demons.

Judging from Meralakoi's account of the unfocused nexus with a host of possible exits Ikanoi and Itsakoi ( names in the farm books) must have been using one of the Golden Keys to open paths between the planes. Such a shame it was lost...

(* Add the equivalent of 2 months tuition from a tutor of Tanmuruktu's level to your demonology for the efforts involved *)

The temple armourer is unhappy about the new cloth provided, and indeed you discover that his first mock-up under suit restricts your limbs so as to preclude any ritual spells or missile weapons.

The clan of Dyers and Weavers provide an unlikely solution to this for you, their expertise in making folding military tents and screens allows them to design two full sets of underwear from the cloth. (* Decide who for please, no bickering *)

These suits act as follows:

Normal blows, falls, etc; subtract 1 damage

Edged weapons " " 2 "

Missiles " " 2 "

Criticals " " d3 "

Heat, acid, Food of Ssu, etc " d6-2 "

needless to say they come in your chosen colour, are not guaranteed and cost k350 to make, each.

**Shiyusakh:**

The amulet gives you protection against the evil and unpleasant spell of the Grey Hand ( turns you body to ash, destroys your soul and prevents any healing or revivification...) for the rest of your life, or while you wear it; which, since it won't work for anyone else while you live, are likely to be coincidental...

Rightfully one of the suits of cloth is yours, as is one of the scimitars. You find the wine does odd things to you...

**Wine:** for one hour

+d3 to INT

+d3 to REAS

**Bisquits:** for one hour

+d3 to STA

for next 5 hours

And you find a letter of credit from one of the higher lineages of Sea Blue in you post; valued at k15000. This appears to be attached to a formal invitation to dinner from the ruling family in the Pala Jakala branch of Sea Blue. The invitation suggests that you may care to invite any of your companions who are noble.

The invitation is for some 10 days or so hence.

You find your dreams are still troubled by dreams which seem to involve that black-maned demon, despite the efforts of the last few days. Several nights later you awake with a start to find a pair of red eyes glowing in the dark at the foot of the pallet. "Do not tell the silvermasks of this"; throbs the full basso voice, "but the flute must be returned to its proper place." There is a pause. " The flute is one of the guides to a key. The key is one of those which keeps Ksarul bound in his half sleep of the azure chamber. Gain the flute, and its box, from the servitor of the Enemy of Knowledge and give it to the Grey Robed thinkers at the temple of knowledge." The eyes start to fade. " Do this and sleep well..."

Alone in the room again you feel a weight on the bed covers. "Sir, I heard a voice ", it is the major domo.

**Fores:**
