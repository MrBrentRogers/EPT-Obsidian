**Sons of the Sun Sod Off**

So read the graffitti brushed across the offices of this illustrious broadsheet. After careful graphological analysis we are in a position to identify the scribe responsible. We know where you live. For a small fee we will not reveal your name and clan in the next issue.

**N'shee terrorises docks**

Pandemonium erupted in the dock area last night when an N'shee was reported to be wandering up the canal ways. The city watch were on the scene in minutes, but were too late to prevent the death of Murash hiFadhekh, owner of a new boat repair business.

Eye witness accounts say that the attack was deliberate and that Murash had been anxious for a few days. Reports that the militia were fatally delayed while they checked his insurance records are hotly denied.

**Tax payments**

Just a few days left folks. Pay up and beat the rush.

**Pirate activity renewed.**

Pirates have struck again. It is not known whether the same ships are responsible, but at least one freighter is now long overdue in good weather. The worst is feared.

**Ahoggyas all at sea**

A squadron of Ahoggya coracles was sighted off the coast this week. Two war ships were dispatched with great speed, a tribute to our navy.

The coracles sped away, whilst the navy battled against the wind. Three fihing boats were found to have been roped together aftr capture by the Ahoggya. They were escorted in.

The crews of the boats report that they were treated well, but that they were forced to sort their catches carefully and hand over any of the rare 'Dispashu' crabs they had caught. Since these crabs are poisonous it is unlikely shamtla will be asked for.

**Swamp folk?**

The legion of Hnalla Lord of Light today return from the swamps of point Kyne. They have completed there survey of watercourses and farmable lands. New land sales are expected. If you have a tough enough skin to defeat the bugs why not give it try ? Expect prices to be low.

**Deserter Sought**

The Legion of Hnalla Lord of Light are seeking a deserter. An artist's impression of the miscreant is available at the Palace of War. In case you need reminding, the penalty for giving aid to a deserter is confiscation of all property and impalement.

**Artist returns**

Thalochain, a new artistic talent has returned from a brief sabatical and completed the mural for Lady Hlakashrokoi. He is therefore available for sponsorship. His work is truely impressive, if a little sureal for some tastes.

His sudden burst of productivity appears in part due to his last companion. The young lady, a part time masseuse from the HOTPH, has since left the city. See told our reporter to 'try it in a small boat' before making a wobbly exit.

**Lost and Found**

Fulatom the Ahoggya has not returned from his last trip, made in the company of several local Luminaries (should that be incendaries ?). An unconfirmed rumour placed him, with a few friends, on a boat that pulled into Jakalla four days back. How the Temple of All Knowledge can lose a three hundred kilo priest is a mystery.

**Dragons seen**

A fisherman reports seeing a dragon fly out to sea over the gulf early last week. 'It was weaving about the sky and gave off little puffs of smoke from one nostril', he claims. Relatives can visit him at the asylum.

**Temple vacancies**

The temple of Sarku are recruiting temple guards who can demonstrate a knowledge of basic techniques against the most common underworld pests. Our intrepid reporter notes that their ranks seem a little thin at the moment.

Several promotions, including one to assistant sorceror to the Keeper of the Copper Keys of the Sepulchure, are also announced. Sudden departure of the previous incumbents to other regional offices is the reason given.

**Royal Visit**

Ma'in Kruthain's barge was spottd on the river recently. Apparently she really is visiting the region.

**Sakbe Road Traffic Report**

The top tier of the Road from Bey Su will be closed for a week for essential inspection and maintenance work. Users of lower levels are asked to make way for displaced traffic. Imperial messengers will carry bells to warn of their approach.

**Arena News**

An anonymous benefactor has paid for a refit of a wing of the arena. This personage will be attending a special display in the next week or so. We hear that animals, foreign barbarians, non-humans, and even a Ru'un will be displayed in combat. Book now.

**Murder hunt**

The badly decayed corpse of a minor village priest was uncovered when the paddys were drained just north of the town. Foul play is suspected.

**Imperial Warrant**

An Imperial warrant has been issued for the arrest of Duman the Undying, recently escaped from the Halls of Silent Waiting. The warrant is counter-signed by the high-priestess of the Temple of Avanthe, and alledges theft of ancient relics from an undisclosed location. The warrant goes on to include un-named accomplices, although no specific charges are attached to them.

Informed legal sources say that despite the lack of a statute of limitations prosecution for his original offences, now 2000 years old, are unlikely to succeed due to lack of witnesses.
