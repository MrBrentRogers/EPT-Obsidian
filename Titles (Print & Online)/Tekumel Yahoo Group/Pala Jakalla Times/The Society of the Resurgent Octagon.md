**The Society of the Resurgent Octagon**

**Introduction**

This is a scenario for...

**Information**

It was founded in 142 by Trakonel I as part of his effort to counter the uprising of the One Other and its followers.  After his victory he endowed it in perpetuity as a centre of excellence and military research.

Its key aim is to preserve the Imperium from any manner of external threat.  Its other  functions are to be the ultimate arbiters of martial prowess, to study theories of battle and all manner of military matters, to be independent record keepers.

As is the way with these things other Emperors and politicians have found other uses for the Society since then.  The current Emperor, Dhitchune is distinctly hostile to this establishment, for some obvious reasons.  Even an apparent Militarists such Mirusiya, has an ambivalent attitude, partly because the Society actually did very little to assist him.  On one hand he has withdrawn all but the most token of guard forces from the old fort, ostensibly because they were needed to reinforce other borders (and probably because Kilalammu is hardly a huge threat to the Empire).  On the other he has rewarded champions of past competitions with valuable Imperial posts and public displays of honour - even to a couple of Thumis majors from the Legion of the Clan of Standing Stone.

The senior members are called the 'Eight Walls of the Octagon'.  They renounce their families, wives and legions on joining; swearing all to the Empire.  Each has passed through the Jade Arch after ritually casting off robes bearing the names of their past attachments embroidered into the fabric using precious threads.  (The cost of these gauze ritual clothes alone makes membership an exclusive thing!).  In reality each keeps in close touch with clan and legion, and the atmosphere within the Fort can become decidedly heated over such matters!

## The Eight Walls of the Octagon are currently:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Danitolen hi Ssussunu, Sword of Fire, Vimuhla, Ruby badge and plaque|43, trim, well dressed and agile.  Aloof, personally wealthy, dedicated to the flame, expert in breaking sieges and in 'raiding for wealth'.  Very intelligent indeed but not always logical in his designs.  Well regarded and considerate.  Doen’t like stinging things and prefers not to be trapped in the corners of rooms or small spaces (hence his seat is always in the centre of the table, regardless of proper etiquette)  Ex-Searing Flame.  He has a huge collection of porcelain model soldiers.<br><br>Motto: Confront them with annihilation|
|Mrikitoi hi Manishi'i, Red Mountain, Chiteng, fire opal badge and plaque|25, youngest and rashest, a political appointee by Tlangten and not yet an expert in his field.  He is, however, bright, strong and quick.  Not very wealthy, relies on a legion pension, and borrowed armour, he does, however have several rare books.  Very honest, to the point of rudeness at times.  Detests all crawling and creeping things.  Ex-Red Devastation<br><br>Motto: Rapacious as fire, none can contain it|
|Kintashmoi Ito, temple of Hru’u guard. Obsidian plaque and badge|55, looks 65 because of over consumption of Hneku.  Devises subtle plans and huge strategic masterpieces based on superb field intelligence and a slow corrosion of the enemies morale.  Clothes tend to threadbare, leading one to believe he is poor; he is in fact the most wealthy.  Ex-Priest and scholar.  (None know that he was previously a molkar in the intelligence arm of the temple guard).  Very lazy at heart, and mortally afraid of precipices and arrow fire - you won’t get him to look out of a window easily!<br><br>Motto: Consider both benefits and harm, deny your enemy his desires.<br><br>He has a large cellar of dronu and mash brandy, and a few tsuhoridu bottles.|
|Vrinsha hi Ssarananu, Emerald Kirtle, Hrihiyal, Jade badge and plaque is highly decorated.|29, plain and unassuming. Expert in all manner of squad level manoeuvres and deceptions.  Devoted and very proud of this post.  Believes in the use of transport and in defence through evasion.  Ex-Aridane Legion of Lady Mrissa.  She has a smattering of healing sorcery and a few scrolls.  Hates being alone (to the extent that she has a slave sleep in her room) and can lapse in retrospecitve ramblings when frightened.<br><br>Motto: Establish by deception, take them in confusion|
|Vayamasu hi Ssanmirin, Sea Blue<br><br>Hnalla, wears a very large and valuable diamond on a bracelet.|38, immaculate, has bleached his hair to a silver grey.  Superb planner of legion scale defences and a fair architect.  Designer of the new forts in the Atkolel Heights.  Strongly supported by clan and legion, he has ample current wealth and a small political following.  Very pedantic, and can jump at the sight of moving shadows (he won’t explain, but it involved going to a summoning when he was a child...)  Ex-Ever Present Glory.<br><br>Motto: Discipline, courage, intelligence, trustworthiness|
|Ganeshma hi Qizibi, Golden Sunburst, Karakan, has a jasper braid about a long pony tail.|41, tends to the casual, but regarded as a fanatical proponent of the art of 'defence through attack' and the use of missiles.  His relaxed demeanour hides one of the most calculating minds of his generation.  His dislike of uniforms extends to occaisionally wandering naked in the halls.  He also prefers drab colours to the brighter orange that one would expect.  Ex-Legion of Lord Kharihaya, he practices with a cross-bow from the roof at a kite every day that he can.<br><br>Motto: Invincibility is a matter of defence, vulnerability is a matter of attack|
|Rustadz hi Qizibi , Golden Sunburst, Cheggara, has tiger’s eye broach.|44, usually wears scholars robes, has no real love of conversation.  Specialist in sub-squad level actions, counter insurgency and guerrilla tactics - not a well regarded field in the current climate.  He sleeps on the rough floor, and regards the use of beds or mats a ‘ignoble in soldiers’.  Filled with nervous energy all the time.  Ex-priest and scholar.<br><br>Motto: Even the trees can be moved when the enemy is coming|
|Thanotokoi hi Tungaqu, Blade Raised High, Ketenku, has a simple steel pin and small plaque.|31, a prodigy who has based a sound tactical and strategic system on the preparation of a radical new form of cartography (in reality one several thousand years old).  His advice is always of the utmost honourability and slanted to the preservation of the maximum number of troops on both sides whilst securing victory.  Ex-Battalions of Vrishtara the Mole, he really detests rain and deep mud.<br><br>Motto: Be immovable as a granite mountain|

**The Fortress**

The Society is based at an ancient grey stone fortress on the Eastern borders.  The fort stands on an island in the middle of a river, with sheer cliffs all around its feet.  The only known way in is via a rickety looking cage is which is lowered from a balcony down to punts that moor at a makeshift landing stage on the river.

The fortress has six levels in current use, the topmost is the roof, which has decking and a rail around the edge, albeit a rather low and old rail.

...

**Other characters**

The eight supervisory members of the Resurgent Octagon have about twenty staff, fifteen researchers and about twelve honour guard.

The staff are the usual mix of servants with a freeman of low clan as Major Domo, and a famous chef.  The Major Domo is Hrinktu hi Fezamnu of Granite Lintel, originally from Usenanu, now too old to be really effective.  The chef at their secret fortress was recruited recently from Jakalla where his skill had been reported as far as Bey Sy.  The funds of Kintashmoi are probably responsible.

Private study at the seminary is allowed, but the journey is onerous and the main material is available in Avanthar or Bey Sy anyway.  Few bother to travel, except for discussions with one of the Eight Walls.  Private tuition is sometimes carried out, usually as a clan favour, but sometimes for money.  Fees are high, mainly to prevent applicants overwhelming the few tutors.  Currently only one student, Girikma hiZiya of Red Dawn, is resident.  She is reserved, shy, keeps her eyes down and her fingers clenched whenever she is addressed.  She has a reputation for working all night, and wears a motif denoting that she is mprning a close relative.  She will not be drawn on the matter.  Students are sent to live the local village during the competition as rooms are severely limited, they can travel in to observe the proceedings as part of their studies.

The local hlaka 'flight', of which their appear to be about 25 members, regards the top of the bute around the fort as a sacred site of sorts, and have a long standing agreement with the Tsolyanu for its use.  The oral tradition has it that the bute was all that was left of a high mountain after a minor battle between the gods.  In return the Hlaka are paid well for the simple task of carrying sealed messages to the nearest Tsolyanu sakbe station.  This rapid postal service is essential, and helps preserve secrecy.  They smell a bit and are prone to hanging around the roof urging players to ‘join them for a quick flight off the walls’, a jest that causes them great hilarity.

A deal with the local farms for food and the rental of land and woods for the use of the fort is also seen as a good thing by both sides.

**The Competition**

Every few years the Society receives recommendations from a variety of legions for promising young officers to be made associates, with a certain degree of kudos and an undoubted flip to their next promotion chances.  The officers have to attend for an award ceremony at the fortress.

The competition has run since its instigation in 1225 under Methunel, The Builder.  Legions send representatives in rotation - The Elite every year, venerable legions every two years and so on, down to every 10 years for minor legions.  The competition, in its heyday would have gathered a whole semetl of officers from each legion together with entourages of noble spectators.  The final parts and ceremonies were once held in Avanthar itself!  Sadly the times of glory have faded, and the current situation is a very modest affair with only two representatives from each of the legions entitled to send them.

It is probable that the thing would have faded away totally if it were not for the support of the stability temples and their legions, although the flame legions have been a little more curious of late; this may be as part of Mirusiya's drive to revive old military customs, or there again it may be because a few officers would like to cultivate alternative friends in these times of trouble.

The customary rewards for success are the title of 'Bulwark Of The Empire', with an honorary stipend of about one hundred kaitars per year from the Palace of War.  Duties of the post involve a few presentations and being on the 'call-up' list for life.

The structure of the competition, as far as can be ascertained involves a day of tutorials and exhibitions, some ceremonies, a day of single combats and personal skills tests, a day of squad tactics and a day of theoretical legion scale battles.  The last day is spent in further ceremonies and in deliberation by the judges.

The whole thing has a slightly quaint and eccentric air about it.  Bribery is strongly discouraged, though one could always make a donation to the library if one wished.

Champions are allowed, and are encouraged for scholars!  Invitees should present themselves, with a small honour guard, arms, armour, rations and whatever reference works they desire, at the fortress one week prior to the intercalary days.

**On arrival**

The group of competitors should be made up to half a dozen by npcs.  It is best to make the npcs fairly impressive, as this should spur the players to greater glory!  (There is no need for their statistics, as they ought not to have to do anything).

The player characters meet at the nearby village and are given rousing, if slightly lengthy introductory speeches from two of the well respected scholar-soldiers of the Imperium,  Danitolen and Ganeshma.  No-one else seems to notice the slightly nervous tone of the second speaker.  The players are joined by Hetle hi Ssanmirin, Legion of Potent Destiny and Orun hi Kurushma of legion of the Givers of Sorrow.  (The later enjoyed the speaches immensely).  The other troopers, slaves, guards and competitors are quiet, are they too overawed by the experience of being spoken to; or was it the thought that copies of their achievements might be reviewed by the Emperor himself?

Many would wonder why they ever agreed to sending their crack Imperial honour guards for a three day hike over mountains infested by local Hlaka, smelly local goat herders, kayi and the usual round of mountain beasties!

The fortress, when they see it for the first time,  will make a fair impact on the main players for its apparent impregnability.  Few will be prepared for the low key reception and the lack of formality at the fortress, in many ways it resembles a seminary.  A little thought as to the resources of a seminary of eight tutors and twenty staff would have explained that one.

The players have free access to the excellent library  (and to read some ancient texts - if they can persuade old Finuela the librarian).  This is a fine place to relax after the rigors of a long journey overland - when it is obvious that they could have come on a comfortable boat instead.

No single player could get past the librarian into the closed stacks without killing him - not an honourable option - but if two players cooperate then one could distract him while the other nips past.  Finuela is particularly fond of reminiscing about campaigns in Yan Kor over a beaker of chumetl laced with cheap dna spirit....

In the stacks one may find copies of three magical texts and a strange treatise on ‘The Black Arch’.  Translation from the unrecognisable language could be performed by Girikma hiZiya of Red Dawn

Dinners will be fairly informal in style, the social mores of reclusive academics may not mix well with the more rigid discipline of Imperial Legions.  Only Danitolen hi Ssussunu and Vayanmasu hi Ssanmirin will set strict seating plans, inviting the players to join them.  Kintashmoi will probably offend a few officers by inviting them to join him for a snack in the kitchen with the servants.

Talk each night will be concentrated on exotic tactical plans, and on the great battles of the past.  Rustadz has an encyclopaedic knowledge of the reign of Hejjeka which comes in useful, as may Vrinsha’s knowledge of cartography.

Encourage players to read around the subjects and to feel empathy for these great and noble soldiers.  There is a real feeling of cameraderie and plenty of food and drink to help it along.

**On day one**

Players must pass the tests of martial prowess - basically a duelling competition in which they must demonstrate very fine technique beyond pure brutality!  Players chose their own opponents - chosing a really tough player to fight will be well regarded, as will the use of advanced techniques, such as riposte, disarm, evades, and feats of bravado.  A huge variety of weapons are availble in the ground floor armoury with which to try.

The dueling square is set on the roof, has a sawdust and sand floor, padded walls, lots of banners and shields and four large pillars to run around.  Observers and judges stand on a raised wooden platform.  Mrikitoi acts as chief judge.  He looks unfavourably on anyone who surrenders before they have taken at least a minor wound!

Don’t forget to award points, say one for every great move and five for a win.

Oh, yes, if players get carried away Vrinsha hi Ssarananu knows lots of first aid, but she will need to read a scroll to remind her of any healing spells, and this will lose the players a whole day in convalescence.

**On day two**

Tests of tactical prowess are dealt with by a question and answer session, written tests and then a brief squad level manoeuver that evening along the river bank.  The players will face no worse risks than falling in or being eaten by the local epeng-(midges!).  Thanotokoi is chief judge for this section, and he will deduct points for any lost ‘troops’.  Vrinsha will control the opposing forces.

Abstract against tactician and soldiery rolls, or set real tests using miniatures.  In the evening the real skill needed is leadership as the ‘troops’ are the local villagers ‘armed’ with straw bundles!  (They get paid 10 dlash each  - a whole kaitar from an officer would inspire them massively!

Vrinsha will employ a novel technique called ‘men of fog’ in which she will strike lots of small straw fires to confuse the field, whilst her ‘troops’ clash pots and shields to make it seem like they are many!

Award points, say out of ten for the questions and out of twenty for success with the local ‘troops’

**Day three**

Tests of strategy, based on epic battles of history.  There is one seige to break, one city to defend, a pitched battle and a long range mission.  However players answer the tutors will have plenty to say on each case, indeed, running out of time is a real risk!

Abstract against strategy and tactician, with a dash of reasoning...or read bits of Deeds of the Ever Glorious and argue about how it should have been done!  (Mr J Bramah’s excellent article in a previous issue would be very useful).  Award points as you see fit.

Kintashmoi leads the judges here, and will, basically disagree with everyone for the sake of it, but politely.  Danitolen and he will contest the best strategy, as can be seen from their c.v.s!

At the end of day three the judges retire to consider the results before an award ceremony to be held in the great refectory that evening.

**The awards!**

The players filter into the great refectory, there the servants all mill about serving refreshments and snacks.  The servants appear rather surlier than usual, and one or two of them have not been seen before.

GM: butter them up.  Its been a hard week.  Why not award study points on an accelerated bases, as their tutors are the best around?  Soldiery, tactician, strategist and weapon skills could all get a part level boost.

As this is a dinner, no-one needs to wear armour, or carry weapons, now do they?  This would be very rude indeed.  Hrinktu will insist.

Talk is rudely interrupted by the ceremony known as the signing of the registers.  They players will be summonded one by one into a side room.  They have to duck under a low lintel to get in.  This prevents them looking up to see the imposing black stone arch that surrounds the door, although they may be distracted by the strange glyphs carved onto the steel plate on the floor!  Vayamasu and Kintashmoi stand behind the writng desk, on which is a beautiful hide book.  “Come forward and record your glory” they intone.  The air of incense becomes thick and there is a moment of dizziness.  They read from a scroll  “Each will sign his name, clan, legion proclaim the the glory of the Empire!”

In the book are the names of most of the great generals and soldiers of the last five hundred years, just take your pick from all the game books!

The black arch is a highly modified jade arch.  It records the players thoughts about the Emporer and the Empire, and players will be selected for further advancement into the inner mystery based on their attitude.  Maybe you should have encouraged them to talk about the Emporer before now?  Roll a PR or MRF defence, secretly, and make it difficult.   If they resist they will be marked in the book next to their name with a little black triangle and red bar, this can be seen by the next player through.

The return to the meal will be welcome, all are offered a little of every thing.  The quail stuffed with mushrooms is  potentially a great favourite.

It would be foolish of a palyer to have seconds... This is poisoned, and for each dish they must make a hard CON check to avoid being sick and disabled as the effect of minus five to dexterity and intelligence takes hold, shortly thereafter followed by a second check to avoid falling over and being paralysed. Did anyone notice the clues about a new chef ?

Within minutes three of the noble scholar hosts go grey and stagger about: Thanotokoi hi Tungaku (Blade Raised High), Vrinsha hi Ssarananu (Emerald Kirtle), Ganeshma hi Qizibi (Golden Sunburst), to be joined by Orun hi Kurushma of legion of the Givers of Sorrow (npc).   It looks like bad food, perhaps the oysters or the grouse?  The surprise at the 'food poisoning' might be very little, after all the place was remote, and facilities primitive.  There should be more surprise at the way in which servants take out daggers to attack the sick,  while some run screaming for the kitchen (downstairs)

This can go on for four or five combat rounds, the servants are fairly poor, and one or two seem to be under a hypnosis or some such.  There are carving knives to use as weapons, broken pieces of table, large wooden platters, the candle sticks and pillows (like shields absorbing two points and potentially disarming the knife wielders!)

Then the sky falls in!  Well, not the sky, only the decorative lattice and paper false ceiling (so recently installed as an aesthetic gesture).  The mode of entry of two identical women dressed in pale grey green thesun gauze, with verdigis vambraces and having tattooed foreheads is unusual, as was their greeting of the party: 'stay still, and you may live.'

Unarmed, and unarmoured, anyone foolish enough to try to fight faces a hail of little metal poison daggers. The toxin is quick and allows them to hear and feel and see, but not move.  It wears off in ten combat rounds.

Other impromptu weapons are the cruets (temporarily blinding anyone if they hit the eyes) and a large tapestry or two that can be used to entangle.

If the players deal with all of the girls, let them see one last one escape down the rope, as below.

After ten rounds the girls will disengage and run out to the roof.  If anyone follows there will be a simple ambush:  two doors are ajar, concealing knife throwers, and two more girls drop behind.  All girls were identical in all respects.  They throw bags that burst, scattered a clouds of green powder into the corridor - PANIC  (it is harmless sneezing dust, but don’t tell the players!

From the windows, or from a sucessful pursuit the girls can be seen to leave on a rope runway, running down to a tree on the other bank.  They have a boat waiting.  They are clearly carrying a large parcel wrapped in hide

Note that it is a false parcel 2 - contents some damp Sagun spores.

It is about now that the fire in the library becomes so strong as to cause smoke to be seen in the coridoors.  It will not spread outside the library, but will be causing a lot of damage in there.  Screams can be heard frm the study, but a person would have to brave the fire to get to it.

If not dealt with in ten minutes the fire in the records wing of the library will have destroyed it, and all trace of the fact that the alumni records were stolen.  Girikma hi Ziya of Red Dawn is in there, choked by smoke, as she is locked in the study.  She is clutching some stainless steel keys that she has taken from a hollow book.  These survive the fire even if she doesn’t!

**Time for reflection**

The servants start to put out the fire, the librarian begins to take stock, healing and allieviations are dragged out and used as required, but only four are available.  In about half an hour the place is calmer. 

Here is how the npcs view events, they will expound these views to any player that talk to them in private.

**The Militarists**

Danitolen, Mrikitoi, Ganeshma, and Rustadz are really angry.  They either want to run off and catch the baddies, or apologise to the Imperialists and kill all members of dark clans or temples ('cos it's obvious that the girls were Hrihiyal, and the Ito sponsor trouble from Livyanu...)  Mrikitoi was especially suspicious of the fact that Kintashmoi was the one who hired the new chef.

The chef is now dead - see kitchen below...

**The Imperialists**

Vayamasu and Thanotokoi say “we are consumed with guilt for the problems that this is likely to cause the Empire.  We have realised that they were duped about the real purpose of the Black Arch”  and have pretty well discovered the true purpose of the Militarists, of whom they have become very suspicious.  Vayamasu is playing along for a while.  They are not critical of the others; they add that “we are too clever to fall for such as obvious ploy as dressing assassins in green to discredit their colleague, Vrinsha - and anyway we know more about what Vrinsha was researching than the Militarists ever will”.

**The Rest**

Kintashmoi and Vrinsha (if she survives the fire) would both like to spend the next several months laughing about the incompetance of the Militarists, whom they have been watching for months.  Kintashmoi had all but sussed the Black Arch himself, and was just waiting for moment to put a spanner in the works, now he doesn't need to.  He will tell players that “the Black Arch records record enough detail to black mail anyone who has used it.  Worse, the psychic traces it records could be used for other purposes.”

Servant then report that two other servants ran off up the hill with little parcels about ten minutes ago.  They can be seen cresting a rise in the distance.  A really fit person could just catch them, or even better use the eye of Ariel  Excellence that the librarian suddenly remembers that he has!

Each of the servants had been mind controlled by a little spawn of Tsur'ru (which I call ‘Pe'dedh’) and these little things look like purple hopping/flying rubber socks.  They jump off the servants and can cause mayhem as people try to evade.  If they score a special hit they stick on and begin to dominate the victim - ‘take parcel and run...’  On the way back try to avoid the irate hlaka, who resent any other flyers in their air-space - and say so, loudly.  Sadly the parcel is just old clothes, wrapped up.

Back in the fort all is not harmonius in the ranks of the Resurgent Octagon.  Mirikitoi apparently tried to kill Kintashmoi, first with a bucket of water and then with a sword.  Mrikitoi “you blackguard, it is all your fault!  You weakened the defences with your research!”

Vayamasu becomes increasingly tight lipped. A pe'dedh is found attached to Rustadz, who has collapsed in a side coridoor leading to the kitchen.  The day is restored to normal when Danitolen takes charge.  “I suggest a council of war”, he says.  This degenerates into a shouting match, and gives a perfect opportunity for Mrikiten to try to kill Kintashmoi again.  Mrikitoi: “I hate you!  All Ito are untrustworthy!  May you rot in a dark pit”  Fortunately Kintashmoi had already told of his suspicions to others.  Kintashmoi “Fool, Buffon, Idiot!  It was your masters who arranged this, can’t you see?  The flame has burnmed away your common sense.  Leave me alone! (ouch)”

He will be prevented after a few blows, either by Vrinsha using magic or Thanotokoi using a big stave, yelling  “Where is your nobility?  Cease and desist, at once, or I will invoke the ancient power of the fortress against you”

The combined brains of the generals, the servants and any players may like to try to account for all of the assassins, servants and staff.  ‘Who is missing?’ they all ask.  The librarian completes his inventory - the last few books of names of people who passed through the arch are missing!

Thanotokoi then opens a panel in the floor under the steel plaque beneath the arch.  He pulls out a metal rod, twists it end and places it, upright in a slot in the floor.  “Now none may enter or leave” he says, “this place is sealed for a month and a day.  The demon Tkel is bound to guard us for that time, and that alone.  I will arrange the sacrifices.”

Outside the sky appears to be filled with black and red sparkles.

Those metal keys will opened the personal box of the scholar, Girikma, to discover that she had been sending messages in code to a member of her family.  If alive - she breaks down and weeps :  “my cousin, who passed through the arch, died of a strange brain disorder.  I am suspicious of the whole place, and worry that someone has been trying to use something here for evil purposes, so I pretended to be a history scholar”

If anyone is a cipher expert and you have had a chance to work on the coded notes Girikma left for a few hours; then one or two ideas come to mind.  With a few substitutions and a basic knowledge of Red Dawn clan history you can decode many of the meanings in the otherwise rambling letters which at first appeared to be full of harmless gossip.  The latest one reads:

“Uncle,  To reiterate my previous letters, which I suspect have been intercepted, I have stumbled by accident onto a part of the puzzle of the irrational behaviour of my cousin.  There is a device here which is being used to affect the minds of those who visit.  Most frighteningly it may be able to undo the loyalty of certain highly placed servants of the Empire; unfortunately it is far from simple in operation, and, in cases such as my dear cousin, has lead to terrible internal conflicts between spirit and intellect.  I cannot determine who is controlling the device, on one hand it seems that the Imperialist are using it to increase the loyalty of some people, whilst the War Party seem to be using it to deliberately increase tension between the Imperium (but not, it seems, the Emperor) and other groups, such as the Royalists and Conservative-Militarists.  Today I managed to find a way into the records room (I made a hole in the wall - so much for security) and took a copy of the last few pages of people who passed through the Octagon.  I shall leave tomorrow and begin the work of decoding and deciphering the pages.  Yours...postscript (in rough hand)”

The door is locked!  Already I feel weak and fear that I have been poisened.  I have given a copy to the Hlaka and put this into my jewel box.  May the Octagon find only gossip in my scribbles!  Put my name in the sacred rolls of the clan, for I did my duty by them.  If you are sent my body whole look within for other jewels............( a post mortem will reveal that she has swallowed a small leather bag containing a piece of paper on which is written a list of twenty names in a cipher.  Two Red Dawn names are in plain hand, it is a job for a clan cousin of Red Dawn to decipher - or a very good Ksarul scholar with a few days to spare)

**Down in the kitchen**

Meanwhile, down in the kitchen, four pe'dedh wreck minor havok before retiring to lurk under a flour bin

Down in the kitchen there are trails of slime that have dried to a silvery dust on the floor.  It leads through to a hole in the brick floor, smashed upwards from below.  It is dark down there.  It smells awful.  Something is slithering. 

The pedeth leap out from the flour bins and spring around!

In the rough space below the kitchen is a store room, a hole has been made in the floor of this as well.  The smell comes from the bodies of four servants and the chef, badly chewed up and partly digested.

Behind the other hole is a natural cave.  In the middle are two alabaster coffins that glow with an inner light.  Inside the coffins is a luminous slime, the trails lead from here.  The trails appear to be nine sets of foot prints, one original in sandles, and four bare footed.  All the same size.  A really good tracker would find that the sandles had just appeared from nowhere in the middle of the cave.  There is a strong residue of magic!

At this point any npcs will leave, either to get help, or just throw up.  In each of the ‘coffins’ a wonderfully engraved verdigris-copper foil can be seen, partly unrolled.

I don’t expect anyone is this stupid, but...anyone who so much as gets a drop of this slime on them (and it is very hard not too, as the stuff is highly tropic towards living tissue!) is immediately overcome.  They fall to the floor and are in agony, or preferably fall into the coffin, dragged in by slimy tendrils.   The slime disolves their skin and flesh like wax.  They writhe even though just bones and tendons.  Only their eyes and skull seems untouched.

Have other players tried to release them from torment yet?  Fire?  Magic?

After about half an hour the flesh begins to grow back onto their bones, all their wounds are healed, and they have gained one strength and one dexterity.  They have also changed sex!  Meanwhile the lid of the other coffin will slide back revealing a double of the player.  This one is, sadly, a mindless animation that stumbles about mewling and tries to clutch hold of anyone it sees, pleading with sad eyes.

The coffins stop seething.  If anyone tries to use them a second time, just dissolve them, no new body.  Sorry.

The scroll is an incantation to a the Goddess of the Pale Bone.  It is written in Duruob. 

Ganeshma orders “everyone out of the kitchen and cellars”, and ushers them up to the (now tidy) great refectory.  He asks for ideas as to how to deal with the situation....

Mrikitoi suggests killing all people who have passed through the arch, in case they become subverted.

Kintashmoi suggests that “it really is about time that they all realised that more than one crime is being committed here.  The Black Arch, is no longer a secret.  What has pased you by is the idea that the Flame radicals under Mirusiya have probably stolen it for their own benefit.  The theft will throw all non-flame people into dispute ('is he affected?' men will say of their commanders) and cause chaos in the minor legions.  It will cause many to believe in a strong external enemy, and will give good grounds for a tightened state control of magic, borders, research and intelligence.  I think that 'protective custody' of important persons will be a natural consequence.”

Danitolen suggests “as none could have escaped, there has been a simple error, and the records were just lost in the fire.”

Rustadz is still unconscious.

Thanotokoi is concerned that “the wardings on the fortress must have failed.  I want time to research some scrolls in my study.”.

Vrinsha is worried, “my study had been ransacked, although nothing appears to have gone.”

Thanotokoi waits for the everyone to speak, then says “ the Keys to the Arch are, indeed missing.”  He describes these as a black octagonal gem that slotted into the Arch.  He only thought to look a minute ago, and is very worried.

**Papers to discover in the library**

A reference to the 'Ways Of The Judges' which states that the only other known routes by the fort are from the Imperial Tower in Avanthar or from the Governor's palace in Fasiltum.  A reference to the four caves beneath the cellars, one used as a store for records, one full of rubble, one large and one small and full of crystals.

**What is going to happen next?**

Only a very diligent survey of the lower store room will reveal a concealed door, this leads off down.  At the bottom of the steps is the discarded armour and gauze clothing of the remaining assassin.  In a tiny chamber, used to store ancient records in decaying trunks, a further hole has been cut into a long, twisting, downward leading cave.  The walls are igneous rock - this is a gas bubble: the breath of Vimuhla!

There are piles of rubble, in some of which a pedeth may lurk...

Around the final bend a blurry grey oval hangs, sizzling, in the air.  Through it vague glimpses of a pale stone city can be seen in the distance, in the foreground a naked girl lays badly wounded, her left arm is cut off at the elbow and her legs appear to have turned to alabaster, her right hand claws at the rock.  It is an overcast day.  A limestone pavement stretchess away to the city.  There is scubby vegetation and little else to see.

In order to pass through the nexus one must remove the metal rod from the floor slot upstairs.  It may be best if you wait for the room to be empty.  It only needs to be removed for a second or so, but this will require a co-ordinated approach.  Oh, yes, and you can’t get back if the rod is replaced, which will happen if you leave it unguarded! 

Ususal sfx for a nexus point, please.  I quite like to reveal visions of wonderous places and other planes as the players hurtle down a grey tunnel, and to get them to roll a few PR or MRF type rolls just to scare them a bit; but then I’m not nice.

The girl is dying, little could save her now.  She gasps, “my name is Xantori.  I expected to wait for the next cusp to allow travel to my sponsors in Fasiltum.  I had spend the last few hours clearing off the fake tatoos, cutting my hair and getting ready.  It should have taken about twenty hours for the nexus to be opened from the temple of Chiteng in Fasiltum.”  She is wracked by coughs, blood appears on her lips, her eyes roll.  If revived she continues: “I was attacked by a fizzing white ball of icey gas.  It knocked me down.  I saw two pale women in kirtles made of finger bones walk up and take the book I had stolen. “  She coughs some more, then Xantori laughs:  “I am not a complete dupe, I have hidden the key under a rock.”  She dies with a wry grin on her face.

Unless the players can return through the nexus they are stuck.  As they are in southern Livyanu it is a long walk, and I leave it to you for the adventures they will have.  They will at least be attacked by a few brigands, plague survivors and have a few difficult explanations to make!

After an hour the servant on watch spots, from the roof, several ragged looking men moving into cover along the cliffs.  They are only brigands, attracted by the smoke and disordered appearance of the fort, but they can manage to put up constant arrow, sling, rock and spear fire on any party silly enough to mount a sally.  They can’t pass the barrier anyway. 

About an hour later dozens of hlaka begin to arrive, calling and circling.  This causes most people to leave the lower levels and have a look.

Hrinktu has some bad news:”rations will only last about five days for this many troops, and not the month that the barrier will last”.  He goes upstairs to tell the boss!

**Where is the forth chamber of crystals?**

There is a tiny hidden ledge, reached by climbing up the fallen rocks in the middle of the bubble chamber.  Normally torch light casts shadows that would conceal it.  It could be seen by a party returniung frm the nexus, as there is a pale grey light from this!  One could then strip and crawl through the gap, if very small and slim and even then with only a dagger.

It leads to a dazzling chamber of pyrites crystals, in the centre lies the last, gel covered clone of Xantori the assassin.  In her hands is the octagonal key to the arch.  She will lie still until, either her other body is killed, or someone finds her.  She will offer point an eye at anyone who comes in, calling “I offer you truce, promise me safe passage, or I’ll fire this!”

She is noble enough to honour her side of the bargain, and is out for revenge on her sponsors and the pariah servants who ambushed her.

Pyrites is a potential ore of iron.  Sadly I cannot imagine any player knowing this.

If none find her, then, about a hour later, the clone hatches to full size with the true soul of Xantori.  She emerges from a hidden cell on an upper ledge.  Naked and armed only with an eye of raging power and a small steel dagger she is aware that she has been betrayed wants revenge.  She will work her way back up to the fort, very stealthily.  When she has stolen some clothes and a sword she will lay in wait for the characters one by one, seeking to enlist players she finds to her cause, in a careful way.

**Statistics**

There should be no need for the Society members to take part in any combat, but there is always the chance of a demonstration duel or competition.  Clearly the non-player characters will have a vastly larger range of skills and experience than is described here, and a GM may wish to fill in the gaps by assuming clan education, temple schools, private tutors and a couple of terms in the army or a temple.  To keep things short this table covers the melee, missile, magic and damage bonuses, plus any unusual or key skills and items.  Normally the society members will not be wearing armour, but may carry one weapon (except to dinner).  If they do wear armour, use ‘Armies of Tekumel’ for a description.
