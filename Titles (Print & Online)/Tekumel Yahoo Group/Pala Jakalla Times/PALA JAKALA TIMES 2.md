Official news

The Governor wishes it to be known that the present problems with the sewer system are due to an abnormally high tide for the time of year. This same problem has caused the harbour master to issue a polite request to all ships to remain in harbour since he cannot predict the effect of these tides on harbour mouth currents

The Biannual closure of the foreigners bridge for repairs is causing minor inconvenience, for which the town Masons Clan are apologetic. Repairs are expected to take about a week.

The spate of robberies in the Hirulakte arena has not gone unnoticed. The commander of the Legion of Ketl expects to bring the miscreants to justice in three days.

Special Bulletin

Mirusiya Tlakotani, the Sure Hand who rules in Glory, has announced that he will send a special Legation to our city next spring. Our Certain Protectors, the Omnipotent Azure Legion are here to make final arrangements. Speculation as to who will form the Legation abounds.

Temple News

All the Temples are closed this week except for the receipt of offerings and sacrifice. The Temple of Dra has not made any announcement itself, but we assume it is suffering from flooded cellars like all the others.

( our correspondant in the Temple of the Lord of worms said the worshippers actually prefered the new smell )

Astrology

Tamruktu will offer his services to the curious for one day next week. Last year it cost about K2000, so start saving.

In the matter of the statues:

There is some suspicion her that the statues were more valuable than they appeared. The sponsor of the outing is known to have recently been involved with smugglers, and his guide disappeared mysteriously on the journey. It is unusual for the swampfrogs to venture so far inland, and never with a magician.

discover the true value and punish any smuggling.

In the matter of the sewers:

The situation deteriorates rapidly, no Priest can make a ritual above the 5th level work and all Sorcerous power is corrupted. We fear the very worst has arisen under a beloved city.

The Governor has left the city.
