**Men seen shouting at drain-holes**

It has been reported to us by a reliable source that three sons of the Empire and a black robed foreigner have been seen shouting down a drain-hole into the city sewer this morning.

We were under the illusion, pardon the jest, that they were too young to have dropped their teeth down the grating, and are puzzled as to why they prefer sewer stench and shouting to the pleasures of the Green Goddesses servants at this auspicious time.

More news as we get it, or rather, we don't.

**Treshkoi leaves city**

after the startling revelation that he was really Golden Sunburst and not something else, our newest merchant friend and cool person, Treshkoi, leaves the city "on business". His companions refused to comment on his motives, and denied that he was "running away like a whipped Hma" after being plagued by visisations from Hra and sundry bad influences.

We wish him a profitable trip.

**OAL officer double crossed**

Our city informer gave us this special report on the latest scandles from the watchmen..

In a rare leak from the boys in white and blue we hear that a rising young star has had his lights put out by the revelation under interogation that his informant had "made it all up".

We expect to hear of a junior officer being posted to the Purdanim detail in the near future. It just goes to show that it pays to impale first and ask questions of the spirit later.

**Ahoggyas and self destructing Worm Priests help plague of invisible rats explode bidet**

In an incredible night at the home of a foreigner we hear that an Ahoggya spilled his brains all over the stairs shortly after spilling his guts on the same steps. Not only bad manners, but bad for the polished steps too.

The revulsion of our informant (if you can't get servants to clear up puke what are they for ?-Ed) is only matched by the inconvenience caused by a robber disguised as a priest of Sarku self destructing in the arms of an Ahoggya. Is this a bizarre love ritual we ask ?

When the OAL arrived they witnessed an exploding bidet, or rather the owner of the house taking out the resentment we all feel for plumbing put in by the locals.

This sight so upset the young officer that he put all his men to flight down the stairs, head first, causing at least one death. (The body has not been found )

Eye-witness reports say that there was talk of giant rats, but all they saw was a spot of inept spell casting.

The damage to the house was minimal, but very smelly. The Temple of Sarku will neither confirm nor deny that the knife found on the roof had been stolen from one of the ritual priests recently. "We do not involve ourselves in matters of the flesh" said their spokesthing.

**Slave returns from swamp a free man with cash in hand**

A slave was recently found wandering in the swamps near point Kyne by a detachment of engineers from the Legion of Hnalla, Lord of Light. He presented them with K1,000 for helping him reach civilisation where he managed to pay off his debt and obtain citisenship papers. He has set up a small boat repairing business near the harbour in partnership with the Guild of Sailors and Merchant Adventurers.

We say 'well done', an example to them all of the fair and just system of slavery in the Empire !

**Robe sale**

A sale of second hand robes, including military, religious and social outfits, takes place today in the market. Get yours now, but watch those blood stains...

**Pirates meet their match**

Those pesky pirates got a shock when they tangled with a battalion of sorcs in a Q ship last week. The brilliant tactical decision has been credited to a member of the OAL, but official sources refuse to confirm this for reasons of Imperial security.

Our boys returned in jubilant mood, and claimed to have inflicted a sorry defeat on the enemy. The nationality of the foe remains a mystery.

Their boat may have sunk, althought the wreckage was not conclusive, and searches continue for the pirate's base of operations.

It is still not safe to venture out except in convoy, but it's one for our side so let's give them a cheer, eh !

**Tuleng wins bet**

Midori Ito is smarting today as he had to pay Tuleng, our new arrival from the City of Bonking Bones, an undisclosed sum in settlement of a bet. Apparently Midori bet Tuleng that no woman could fall for him (Tuleng that is) as he was such an ugly b*****d. Rather than take Midori to court, and there were no witnesses, Tuleng just went out and got screwed. Neat one Tuleng !

**Adventure playground**

Did you know how many places there are locally where you can get rich, get mad or get killed. The first answer on a post-card with all forty gets an expenses paid trip to everyones favourite ski resort; the Garden of Weeping Snows.

**Mesku plates "a disgrace" says the Governor**

In a rare public speach the governor has hit out at modernist influences that are reducing the use of Mesku plates in the city. 'This must stop' he said. 'The youngsters who think thay can just clapper at any door at any time are being encouraged by the slapdash habits of foreign major domos'.

The governor is facing a minor shamtla claim after striking a visitor who failed to notice the meshku of conubial bliss at the governors door.

The clan of Enamellers and Engravers are running a stall in the market with a sale on large and traditional meshku.
