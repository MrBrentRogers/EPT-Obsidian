## INTRODUCTION

The Palace of the Realm is situated in the outer grounds, south of the Governer's Palace, to the south of the Equnoyel river which bisects the city.

In Jakalla the OAL is situated within the Governer's Palace together with his personal staff, to the North of the Palace of the Realm. [text lost] oms in glue together? The answer to this is that [text lost]

[text lost]...There are probably 1000 odd people working at the Palace of the Realm (some of them are very odd). The grounds swarm with food vendors, sellers of beverages, scribes for the illiterate, guides, guards, servants, minor bureaucrats and other such.

## THE POLITICS

Politically, the Palace of the Realm is split between the Imperialists (OAL, Servitors of Silence, et.al.) who are occupy the key positions and the Royalists (from the VH clans) who are fairly numerous in the higher echelons of the bureaucracy.

# CONCERNING THE LAWCOURTS 
## COURT

### CASES PENDING:

the suing of shamtla from Kruom hiArkodu (Standing Stone Clan -H; a patriarch of Qon) who called Lord Vurrighend Khekhessa (of the Royal clan of Heru, W. Salarvya; a Lord Adept of Thumis who is visiting Jakalla to glean certain facts from the Necropolis) a slave and an idiot during a conversation whose full details neither wish to expose.

the alleged murder of Huketlayu hiViridame of the Cloak of Azure Gems (VH) by Ta'ana hiRi'inyussa of the Golden Sunburst Clan (VH). He had puportedly raped her and a fiveday later was set upon by three seeming Livyani slaves in the Feasting Room of his clan. They killed each other before being taken by the clan guards, but had been seen in the company of one of Ta'ana's slaves the day before.

the trial of Elulen hiDanolel of the Slavers Clan of the Silver Anklet who has apparently witheld some 200,000 Kaitars of Taxable monies from the Imperial Tax collectors (or did she refuse to supply a particularly winsome slave-girl to the expropriating official who had conceived a lust for her?).

the theft of an iron Engsvanyali Sword, 1000 golden Suor and an amulet of carnelian from the tomb of the Clan of the hiSSankolun lineage of the Clan of Sea Blue. These materials were found in the possession of Fyerik hiBanthadtha of the Clan of the Scarlet Planet of Knives before he disappeared with them. His clan is now being sued by the Clan of Sea Blue, although it claims that he was murdered by the Clan of Sea Blue and his newfound treasures confiscated by them.

the exact dispersal of the possessions of Meshmuyel hiAmnu'a of the clan of the Red Stone (H) who left riches of 730,000 K after his death of a surfeit of Tsuhoridu. Two wills exist, the older having a codicil which is more recent than the newer will, but which cuts out his clan and gives the money to his temple and his third wife's clan (the Dark Water, H), where he was living at the time of his death.other events concerning the lawcourts

the death of Trimnesh hiLangsha of the Scroll of Wisdom clan (M), a free-lance jurist who had done very well indeed in the 2nd Appelate Court some ten or more years ago. His elder daughter now practises there but does not have his knack for choosing the more lucrative cases.

## Other Events

### Concerning the other departments

the registration of quadruplets, twice in a month, by members of the Flowering Life Clan (L).

the disappearance of Zaren hiBalam of the Clan of the Purple Gem (H), a young up-and-coming bureaucrat who has not been seen for a month. He was quiet, unassuming and utterly boring. Has he been murdered? kidnapped? become addicted to Zu'ur or Tsuhoridu? Has he fallen madly in love with some foreign lady and followed her home to a distant land (giggles).

the promotion of Chargesh hiSsandagash of the Clan of the Plume of White (L) to the rank of Senior Scribe (circle 9) in the Department of the Third Courtyard. This is an unheard-of rank for one of his lowly background. His sly ways and unctuous manner should have prevented his promotion to such an august post. Did he blackmail somebody? [He had been very involved in the Clan of the Azure Gem's lawsuit against the son of a senior OAL official, which, much against expectations, was settled in their favour.]

the assumption of Aridani status by Elena hiSsankolun of the Clan of Sea Blue will be held in two days time: the cooks are preparing a great feast and you can smell the aromas if you just walk down the corridor over there. Her mother is a Tlakotani from upriver - and ugly as a chlen-beast! Prince Rereshqala might be coming!

the attempt to trace Meshmuyel hiTengetlaku of the Clan of the Red Sword (-H), who had fled Jakalla with a tax debt of 25,000K (massive due to fines for non-payment) seems to have traced his flight to Heru in Salarvya. He personally insulted the Grand Sequestrator, Count Chushel hiSsanmirin, arranging for the display of a Meshqu plaque denoting engagement with a Chlen (the Badge of Expression of Animalistic Passion - described in the Paean of Psankothoth of Nirukkai) outside his apartment door. The resulting arousal of hilarity within his clan severely discomfited the grand sequestrator in a manner hitherto unseen since his first wife left him for a tattooed Livyani.

the constant presence of Messiliu Giyo, a Mu'ugalavyani potter, seeking to evade taxation on an antique vase found amongst his wares by the inspectorate. Its value far exceeded that of the rest of his stock and, he claims, was stolen by thieves after the inspection. He claims that the resulting levy of taxes will utterly beggar him. He further claims that it was not his, having been planted amongst his goods by those thieves the previous day - he knows not why.
