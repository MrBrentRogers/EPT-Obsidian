1793OCTO
**The Society of the Resurgent Octagon** was founded in 142 by **Trakonel I** as part of his effort to counter the uprising of the **One Other** and its followers. After his victory he endowed it in perpetuity as a centre of excellence and military research.

Its key aim is to preserve the Imperium from any manner of external threat. Its other functions are to be the ultimate arbiters of martial prowess, to study theories of battle and all manner of military matters, to be independent record keepers.

As is the way with these things other Emperors and politicians have found other uses for the Society since then. The current Emperor, **Mirusiya**, has an ambivalent attitude. On one hand he has withdrawn all but the most token of guard forces from the old fort, ostensibly because they were needed to reinforce other borders (and probably because Kilalammu is hardly a huge threat to the Empire). On the other he has rewarded champions of past competitions with valuable Imperial posts and public displays of honour - even to a couple of Thumis majors from the Legion of the Clan of Standing Stone.

The senior members are called the '**Eight Walls of the Octagon**'. They renounce their families, wives and legions on joining; swearing all to the Empire. Each has passed through the **Jade Arch** after ritually casting off robes bearing the names of past attachments. In reality each keeps in close touch with clan and legion, and the atmosphere within the Fort can become decidedly heated over such matters!

## The Eight Walls of the Octagon are currently:

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|**Temple**|**Emblem**|**Name And Clan**|**Mini-CV**|
|Vimuhla|Ruby|Danitolen hi Ssussunu, Sword of Fire|43, trim, well dressed and agile. Aloof, personally wealthy, dedicated to the flame, expert in breaking sieges and in 'raiding for wealth'. Ex-Searing Flame.<br><br>Uninjured, but unconcious in a hall way near the dining room after week one, was shaken awake easily.|
|Chiteng|Fire Opal|Mrikitoi hi Manishi'i, Red Mountain|25, youngest and rashest, a political appointee by Tlangten and not yet an expert in his field. He is, however, bright, strong and quick. Not very wealthy, relies on a legion pension. Ex-Red Devastation<br><br>Badly wounded and only just standing with four lots of poison to deal with, five if you include dinner, he was grateful to be cured by an Eye.|
|Hru'u|Obsidian|Kintashmoi Ito|55, looks 65 because of over consumption of Hneku. Devises subtle plans and huge strategic masterpieces based on superb field intelligence and a slow corrosion of the enemies morale. Clothes tend to threadbare, leading one to believe he is poor; he is in fact the most wealthy. Ex-Priest and scholar.<br><br>Curently looking after [Tom] Zalan.<br><br>Uninjured after the dinner he took a serious wound from Mrikiten shortly after.|
|Hrihiyal|Jade|Vrinsha hi Ssarananu, Emerald Kirtle|29, plain and unassuming. Expert in all manner of squad level manoeuvres and deceptions. Devoted and very proud of this post. Believes in the use of transport and in defence through evasion. Ex-Aridane Legion of Lady Mrissa.<br><br>Looking after Danitolen (npc).<br><br>Poisoned by dinner, she lay unmoving in the dining room until rescued. Although healed by an Eye she is a drooling wreck at the minute.|
|Hnalla|Quartz / Diamond|Vayamasu hi Ssanmirin, Sea Blue|38, immaculate, has bleached his hair to a silver grey. Superb planner of legion scale defences and a fair architect. Designer of the new forts in the Atkolel Heights. Strongly supported by clan and legion, he has ample current wealth and a small political following. Ex-Ever Present Glory.<br><br>Looking after [Alan] Hiyan<br><br>Lightly wounded in the first bouts, but was healed by an Eye.|
|Karakan|Jasper|Ganeshma hi Qizibi, Golden Sunburst|41, tends to the casual, but regarded as a fanatical proponent of the art of 'defence through attack' and the use of missiles. His relaxed demeanour hides one of the most calculating minds of his generation. Ex-Legion of Lord Kharihaya.<br><br>Looking after Orun (npc).<br><br>Knocked out by a choke hold in a side room, and mesmerised by a Tsu'ru pup, he has now been restored to rude health.|
|Chegarra|Tiger's eye|Rustadz hi Qizibi , Golden Sunburst|44, usually wears scholars robes, has no real love of conversation. Specialist in sub-squad level actions, counter insurgency and guerrilla tactics - not a well regarded field in the current climate. Ex-priest and scholar.<br><br>Poisoned by dinner, he lay unmoving near the player's rooms, and the Eye has not fully restored him.|
|Ketenku|Steel|Thanotokoi hi Tungaqu, Blade Raised High|31, a prodigy who has based a sound tactical and strategic system on the preparation of a radical new form of cartography (in reality one several thousand years old). His advice is always slanted to the preservation of the maximum number of troops on both sides whilst securing victory. Ex-Battalions of Vrishtara the Mole.<br><br>Looking after Murugani.<br><br>Poisoned by dinner, he lay unmoving in the dining room, and has been only partly healed.|

The eight supervisory members of the Resurgent Octagon have about twenty staff, fifteen researchers and about twelve honour guard.

The staff are the usual mix of servants with a freeman of low clan as Major Domo, and a famous chef. The Major Domo is Hrinktu hi Fezamnu of Granite Lintel, originally from Usenanu, now too old to be really effective. The chef was recruited recently from Jakalla where his skill had been reported as far as Bey Sy. The funds of Kintashmoi are probably responsible.

The local hlaka 'flight' or clan regards the top of the bute around the fort as a sacred site, and have a long standing agreement with Tsolyanu for its use. The oral tradition has it that the bute was all that was left of a high mountain after battle between the gods. In return they are paid well for the simple task of carrying sealed messages to the nearest Tsolyanu sakbe station of legion. This rapid postal service is essential, and helps preserve secrecy.

A deal with the local farms for food and the rental of land and woods for the use of the fort is also seen as a good thing by both sides.

The competition has run since its instigation in 1225 under Methunel, The Builder. Legions send representatives in rotation - The Elite every year, venerable every two years and so on down to every 10 years for minor legions. the competition, in its heyday would have gathered whole semetl of officers from each legion and entourages of noble spectators. The final parts and ceremonies were once held in Avanthar itself. Sadly the times of glory have faded, and the current situation is a very modest affair with only two representatives from each legion entitled to send them.

It is probable that the thing would have faded away totally if it were not for the support of the stability temples and their legions, although the flame legions have been a little more curious of late; this may be as part of Mirusiya's drive to revive old military customs.

The customary rewards for success are the title of 'Bulwark Of The Empire', with an honorary stipend of about one hundred kaitars per year from the Palace of War. Duties of the post involve a few presentations and being on the 'call-up' list for life.

The structure of the competition, as far as can be ascertained involves a day of tutorials and exhibitions, some ceremonies, a day of single combats and personal skills tests, a day of squad tactics and a day of theoretical legion scale battles. The last day is spent in further ceremonies and in deliberation by the judges.

The whole thing has a slightly quaint and eccentric air about it. Bribery is strongly discouraged, though one could always make a donation to the library if one wished.

Champions are allowed, and are encouraged for scholars! Invitees should present themselves, with a small honour guard, arms, armour, rations and whatever reference works they desire, at Avanthar one week prior to the intercalary days.

Private study at the seminary is allowed, but the journey is onerous and the main material is available in Avanthar or Bey Sy anyway. Few bother to travel, except for discussions with one of the Eight Walls. Private tuition is sometimes carried out, usually as a clan favour, but sometimes for money. Fees are high, mainly to prevent applicants overwhelming the few tutors. Currently only one student, Girikma hiZiya of Red Dawn, is resident. Students are sent to live the local village during the competition as rooms are severely limited, they can travel in to observe the proceedings as part of their studies.

What happened 4/7/93

The player characters met at Avanthar and were given rousing, if slightly lengthy introductory, speeches from two well respected generals of the Imperium. No-one seemed to notice the slightly nervous tone of the second speaker. They were joined by Hetle hi Ssanmirin, Legion of Potent Destiny and Orun hi Kurushma of legion of the Givers of Sorrow. (The later enjoyed his uncle's speach).

Too overawed by the experience of being spoken to; or was it the thought that copies of their achievements would be reviewed by Mirusiya himself?; none wished to shop in Avanthar. Well none except Murugani, who, having received a love letter from the mysterious Ninue thought of buying a little token for her.

He seems to feel that marriage to a low lineage in the clan he is trying to bribe his way into is less desirable than paying 40,000 K for the privilege. Does he know what a dowry is, I wonder?

They set off for a completely boring journey to Fasiltum, relieved only by a quick peek at Bey Sy. In Fasiltum Treshkoi was upset at the demands of the local Governor to be shown a quick review of the Aircar. Treshkoi's refusal was a sound political judgement, despite the constant invidious comparisons to Tlangten's Aircar and to Jadthek's prowess.

The party seemed reluctant to separate from their troops at the jump off point. Why they ever agreed to sending their crack Imperial honour guards for a three day hike over mountains infested by local Hlaka, local goat herders, kayi and the usual round of mountain beasties I shall never know. Yet separate they did.

Treshkoi and Kengitlen (a now revealed minor Tlakotani) made a fair job of piloting the aircar over the mountains. Their lack of imagination was probably caused by the childish delight they feel for being allowed to use this toy in a blatant attempt at propaganda by the Military party. (especially with a minor Tlakotani as pilot - no doubt his illustrious uncle will be wanting a chat if it all goes wrong...)

The fortress made a fair impact on the main players for its apparent impregnability. Few were prepared for the low key reception and the lack of formality. A little thought as to the resources of a seminary of eight tutors and twenty staff would have explained that one.

The players did see the library, but did not ask to see any of the other local highlights, but this was a reasonably well played reaction to the rigors of a long journey overland instead of the comfortable boat ride that they could have had.

Dinner was fairly informal in style, the social mores of reclusive academics did not mix well with the more rigid discipline of Imperial Legions. Only Danitolen hi Ssussunu and Vayanmasu hi Ssanmirin went for strict seating plans, inviting the Tlakotani and, astonishingly, Treshkoi to join them. Treshkoi had only just recovered from the insult of being offered food in the kitchen with the other transport operatives...

Talk concentrated on exotic tactical plans and the great battles of the past. Murugani's encyclopaedic knowledge of the reign of Hejjeka came in useful, as did Changlisa's knowledge of cartography. ( Changlisa's hidden plans to find the lost city of Chetro Ketl had not been revealed, although the mock battle in front of him could well be called the 'City of Bowls'.)

Talk was rudely interrupted by the ceremony known as the signing of the registers. The imposing black stone arch, the steel plate on the floor, the air of the ceremonial all were completely ignored by the players. Only Zalan can remember what happened; all of the others have a strange mental blank for a few minutes. Only Zalan's name has a little black triangle and red bar next to it.

The return to the meal was well received, all ate a little of every thing. The quail stuffed with mushrooms was a favourite. It was lucky no player had seconds, as within minutes three of the noble scholar hosts went grey and staggered about: Thanotokoi hi Tungaku (Blade Raised High), Vrinsha hi Ssarananu (Emerald Kirtle), Ganeshma hi Qizibi (Golden Sunburst), to be joined by Orun hi Kurushma of legion of the Givers of Sorrow (npc). The luck and good fortune that was to come began here for the players as none fell ill - although they complained a lot at the effect of minus one to dexterity and intelligence shortly thereafter. Still, it was better than anaphylactic shock I suppose.

The surprise at the 'food poisoning' was very little, after all the place was remote. The clues about a new chef dropped every five minutes were utterly ignored. The fact that the chef was murdered was overheard by Treshkoi, in a very subtle manner. He then proceeded to ignore this, and carried on eating.

The surprise at the way in which servants took daggers to the sick was somewhat more. Hiyan was excellent in the rugby tackle of the wayward servant nearest him, and was lucky to avoid the carving knife thrown by his associate. A quick bash on the wall ended that one. (Kengitlen says it was a good clean shot...)

Murugani took his usual direct approach to the problem, and thumped the nearest door frame with a drop kick. Vayanmasu ran off to the kitchens, closely followed by a servant. The treacherous servants were dealt with in seconds. Then the sky fell in.

Well, not the sky, only the decorative lattice and paper false ceiling (so recently installed as an aesthetic gesture). The mode of entry of two identical women dressed in pale grey green thesun gauze and having tattooed foreheads was unusual, as was their greeting of the party: 'stay, and live.' Needless to say the party have never been one's for taking the advice of others.

Unarmed, and unarmoured, they faced a hail of little metal poison daggers. Mrikitoi hi Manishi'i of Red Mountain went down with two hits, and promptly stood up - stamina of an ox, that boy. After several excellent shots Kengitlen went down like a rock from one stray missile and stayed down. The toxin allowed him to hear and feel and see, but not move. In his case the heroic lunges and use of a pillow as a shield was just not enough. (DJB should pillows stop more than three points?)

Murugani, Zalan and Hiyan went for it in a big way, taking on the lady guests with an assortment of table implements, candle stands and sheer nerve. Danitolen hi Ssussuma showed real Sword of Fire mettle and hurled the salt in the face of the first girl he saw. The way in which the little lasses put over two full actions a round and could deflect even special charage attacks was the usual cause of player dissent; { though whether Dermot's insistent theme throughout the game that he was the only true keeper of the law of Morris, or whether Duncan's constant bickering was more hateful I am not sure}. Either way the girls stood their ground for the required time, doing a little more damage on the way. Can people really have such luck with stamina I ask?

The fight was decisively turned by Kalamuru hi Vriddi pulling a tapestry off the wall, after many struggles, and enveloping one of the female mayhem merchants. An inspired and heroic move which showed great imagination. ( I must remember to give him a free rank of Warrior ) Bound, gagged and sat on she was reduced to silent fury, while her friend ran from the room. Learned evade skill mixed with acrobat and martial arts is a fine mix for any sudden disengagement. Why are players allowed to make things up and not the GM?

Vayanmasu returned from the kitchen and saved Treshkoi a fruitless search for the way down. All rushed, like Hmelu to the slaughter, up to the upper levels in defence of 'something important'.

At least they delayed several minutes while they put on armour, enabling the girls to prepare the next scene up stairs and have a cup of tea or too.........zzzzzzzzzzzz.......

A simple ambush took them all by surprise on the way up: two doors were ajar, concealing knife throwers, and two more attackers followed up the stairs. It became clear that the girls were identical in all respects. A display of sheer brute force demolished the two doors, and scattered a cloud of green powder into the corridor. General panic ensued. The party split up, three through the big door with the Imperial Seal on it, two through the door on the left, one through the door on the right, and three in the corridor.

In the two side rooms brief but brutal fights saw two girls flee and one ensorcelled by Treshkoi (his little spell causing a neat bit of GM confusion - if you dominate someone who is a telepath can you get them to attack their telepathic partner? I opted for the cop out of 'coma')

In the front room Murugani saw one of the girls leave on a hang glider.

In the corridor Changlisa took decisive action against the two assailants on the stairs by way of a Terrible Eye of Raging Power. The corridor was fifteen metres long. The result was the sudden removal of the favourings and most of the hit points of the assassins, the removal of most of the hair and hit points of all the people in the corridor, and a nasty case of sunburn on the backs of the two notable scholars in the next room.

No-one said thanks for removing the green powder as it was harmless anyway.

Murugani avoided immolation by 'friendly fire' in a simple and effective manner: he leapt out of the window. Eight floors up. No parachute. Only the interposition of a passing assassin on a hang glider saved his fall. He will insist on the act being a deliberate attempt to prevent the theft of a 'something important'; just as soon as the Excellent Ruby Eye of Treshkoi's is switched off.

This act of superb bravery wsa rewarded by two whole ranks of warrior. A truely inspired action of a great hero.

Treshkoi flew out of the window, no aircar, just spells, and destroyed the get away boat with a Hand's of Kra. The sole survivor was then lifted sixty metres and dropped, the parcel held by them was recovered, damp but intact. ( DJB to note that it is false parcel 2 - contents some damp Sagun spores...)

Escaping party of green girls two ran up the mountain track away form the fort, and towards the oncoming troops. No players have followed yet.

Treshkoi has now began his flight back, and has noticed the smoke from one window, and from the wooden way station which is essential to getting down from the fort. He has not seen the smoke from the aircar cave yet.

Of the nine assassins the players saw eight. One was sunk in the get away boat. One is now dead of suffocation, enveloped in the E-Ruby arms of Murugani. They have wrapped one in a carpet, and one is, temporarily, under a trance. If Treshkoi takes one more minute she will be away. One had the rope she was climbing down cut by Hiyan before she reached the ground, and is being helped down the cliff with serious injuries by a friend. The two others faked injury to allow retreat.

Summary:

in one minute the trance on one girl in the side room will fade;

in five minutes the fire in the way station will be too strong to put out, destroying the way down;

in ten minutes the fire in the records wing of the library will have destroyed it, and all trace of the fact that the alumni records were stolen. Girikma hi Ziya of Red Dawn will also have been choked by smoke, as she is locked in the next room;

every minute the aircar takes one point from the fire in and around it;

in twenty minutes the scholars poisoned by daggers will begin to stop breathing, as will any servants or guards so injured. The cure is near to hand;

about five minutes ago the real Xantori left, with the two assistants who faked injury, via the underworld. She has the real prize and the alumni records

## What happened next time we met

There is considerable confusion over the progress of the next evenings game. This was caused by the failure of the players to make any sort of map of their environment, and by the huge numbers of npcs (well 10 of them) coming and going in little groups.

**The Militarists**

Danitolen, Mrikitoi, Ganeshma, and Rustadz would have been in this, if some of them did not have brain damage and other problems from the earlier action.

The conscious one's wanted to run off and catch the baddies, apologise to the Imperialists and kill all members of dark clans or temples ('cos it's obvious that the girls were Hrihiyal, and the Ito sponsor trouble from Livyanu...) Mrikitoi was especially suspicious of the fact that Kintashmoi hired the chef.

**The Imperialists**

Vayamasu and Thanotokoi were consumed with guilt for the problems that this is likely to cause the Empire. They have realised that they were duped about the real purpose of the Black Arch, and have pretty well discovered the true purpose of the Militarists, of whom they have become suspicious. Vayamasu is playing along for a while. They are not critical of the others; they are to clever to fall for such as obvious ploy as dressing assassins in green to discredit their colleague - and anyway they know more about Vrinsha than the Militarists...

**The Rest**

Kintashmoi and Vrinsha (if she was conscious) would both like to spend the next several months laughing about the incompetance of the Militarists, whom they have been watching for months. Kintashmoi had all but sussed the Black Arch himself, and was just waiting for moment to put a spanner in the works, now he doesn't need to.

The main fight in a side room, where the Vrissi, sharing several key features with Duncan's other character, make a fearsome attack on two startled assassins. He used all his ranks of warrior, rather than any more noble option, and grabbed them by the scruffs of their necks. The sound of their heads being banged together echoed down the corridor for an instant. Without favourings they would have been knocked out cold, as it was the next few rounds of wild fumbles by the girls, and lucky hits by the Vriddi caused one to flee and the other to be battered senseless by a series of headbutts.

Treshkoi was highly alarmed to be told that two were escaping up the hill with little parcels; but even more alarmed when he finally decided to investigate the smoke from the aircar. He has rarely been so miserable.

To console himself he set off for a three minute flight up the valley to catch up with the fleeing party. An hilarious (for me) game of cat and mouse ensued - each time he saw one of them emerge from cover he took a shot, they would resist, Treshkoi would try the other one, the first target would then bolt for cover. The constant explosions from the aircar were an added distraction for him.

The game ended with Treshkoi down to 70 spell points, and having used about four more eye charges. The losers had one (with the package) under E-Ruby, the other dead through Missile of Metallja. At this point Murugani, having been freed from E-Ruby by Treshkoi on his fly past, had run up the hill to join in, and the fun started.

Each of the servants had been mind controlled by little spawn of Tsur'ru (which I called Pe'dedh) and these little flying socks caused mayhem as Treshkoi tried to evade and Murugani got closer. A quick riposte and backslice by the big galoot shredded the tiny terror.

Back in the fort the players had teamed up with Vayamasu to put out several fires with the Eye of Creeping Fog of Doom, and had begun to realise that all was not harmonius in the ranks of the Resurgent Octagon. Mirikitoi had tried to kill Kintashmoi, first with a bucket and then with a sword. Vayamasu had become increasingly tight lipped. No-one wanted to save Vrinsha The other poisen victims were rapidly developing brain damage, and the party had their fist encounter with a pe'dedh that had attached itself to Rustadz. All was not going well.

The day was restored to normal when Danitolen was bought around. He suggested a council of war. This gave a perfect opportunity to Mrikiten to try to kill Kintashmoi again. Fortunately Kintashmoi had already told of his suspicions to Changlisa, and the party stepped in to prevent more blood being shed. Kintashmoi survived to carry messages to the Hlaka.

The combined brains of the players and npcs added the assassins up to nine, and so there was a need to find out where the nineth one had gone.

(Changlisa has a mysterious set of keys now)

Treshkoi returned to mind bar the carpet girl, and found out a little of the recent genesis of the opponents. He was less than impressed by the package of damp Sagun spores (which is, even now, growing slowly in one of the bedrooms, he, he, he)

Slowly the true meaning of the theft sank in, as each of the surviving Oct's let slip a little of the plot. As in every other game the players got it wrong, but they were having fun.

Now we have three pcs who did not go throught the B**** A*** and who find it very annoying that the others cannot even hear the word, let alone think about it. They are of one mind that they should go after Xantori, even if they cannot decide how to do this.

Meanwhile down in the kitchen the last four pe'dedh wreck minor havok before retiring gracefully - leaving two players out for the count and a very smug Vriddi...

YET another week passed with very little to show for it. The follow up party, with Mogs, Jack and various npcs crossed the mountain after a brief encounter with a rock throwing Hlaka. They swapped a message for some biscuits with the arial pedant, then practiced their scree sliding for a while.

On the way they met the E-ruby servant and the sunked ferry boat, but dealt with all of them easily.

Back at the fort no-one was demonstrating any initiative at all, and the culprit was, by now, far away. The only high point was Dermot thinking of burning down the fort to kill an immature Sagun - a timely plan as thy take over a year to grow...

Most people were fully healed, and had recovered their spell points. It is a pity that they chose not to leave earlier, for if they had the prey would have been badly wounded and out of magic. If they catch up now they will have a much tougher fight.

Changlissa found another key, and opened the personal box of the dead scholar, to discover that she had been sending messages in code to a member of her family. Scholars are always a problem.

The rest of them finally went down to the kitchen and are currently pondering the trails of slug slime that have dried to a silvery dust on the floor. none suspect its potency.

**Handout**

Changlissa

You have had a chance to work on the coded notes for a few hours, and one or two ideas have come to mind. With a few substitutions and a basic knowledge of Red Dawn clan history you can decode many of the meanings in the otherwise rambling letters which at first appeared to be full of harmless gossip. The latest one reads

Uncle

To reiterate my previous letters, which I suspect have been intercepted, I have stumbled by accident onto a part of the puzzle of the irrational behaviour of my cousin. There is a device here which is being used to affect the minds of those who visit. Most frighteningly it may be able to undo the loyalty of certain highly placed servants of the Empire; unfortunately it is far from simple in operation, and, in cases such as my dear cousin, has lead to terrible internal conflicts between spirit and intellect. I cannot determine who is controlling the device, on one hand it seems that the Imperialist are using it to increase the loyalty of some people, whilst the War Party seem to be using it to deliberately increase tension between the Imperium (but not, it seems, the Emperor) and other groups, such as the Royalists and Conservative-Militarists. Today I managed to find a way into the records room (I made a hole in the wall - so much for security) and took a copy of the last few pages of people who passed through the Octagon. I shall leave tomorrow and begin the work of decoding and deciphering the pages.

Yours...

postscript (in rough hand)

The door is locked! Already I feel weak and fear that I have been poisened. I have given a copy to the Hlaka and put this into my jewel box. May the Octagon find only gossip in my scribbles! Put my name in the sacred rolls of the clan, for I did my duty by them. If you are sent my body whole look within for other jewels....

........( a post mortem will reveal that she has swallowed a small leather bag containing a piece of paper on which is written a list of twenty names in a cipher. Two Red Dawn names are in plain hand, it is a job for a clan cousin of Red Dawn to decipher - or a very good Ksarul scholar with a few days to spare)

The players finally set themselves in order. This did not help as the first guards to handle anything in the underworld were immediately overcome by the body reversion nano-tech slime in the coffins. The effect was gruesome, and would have led to them gaining wonderful bodies from the transform process. Would have if Mogs had not killed them and burned the remains, nearly toasting the whole fort as well.

Mogs had the only sensible idea, go back to the Empire and get some really tough sorcerors to go down the underworld for them. This was spoiled by the ideas of others to go via Fasiltum, which would lead them to a quick prison sentence for desertion, damage to Imperial property etc, etc... Even worse Murugani guessed that the best thing that the Octs could do would be to kill off all visitors who may have been 'preprogrammed' by the Black Arch. No prizes for spotting who else is on the list.

They did hit on the idea that Mrikitoi had bought the Black Arch up from the underworld below the fortress, and Changlissa helped them to piece together the idea that there was a passage between the planes (the way of the judges) which passed on to Chetro Ketl. The old rules of the contest were formally invoked by Danitolen and Vayamasu; which means that if any of the players gets to Chetro Ketl and competes then they will win the traditional prize. This prize has not been discovered by the players yet.

The highlight of the evening was Murugani and the other Vriddi run by Duncan in a long term show down with Mrikitoi. I really think the whole fight was about the right to hold the enchanted sword wielded, unwillingly, by Murugani. The tension was palpable and the insults both barbed and sharp. Mrikitoi almost faced him down; in a rare display of cool, calm and collected behaviour; but in the end was so goaded as top launch an attack under cover of a book. The ensuing sword fight was indecisive (one blow each landed in about eight combat rounds) and ended with Mrikitoi fleeing to Vayamasu's room.

The action shifted to this room, where difficult questions began to be asked, not leaast of which was about the purpose of the missing items. Mrikitoi was eventually unmasked as the person running the Black Arch (as V was stupified when asked to describe it; thus giving away the fact that he had been brainwashed)

To add to all of this the poisen was beginning to wear off, Rustadz and Vrinsha both began to talk, revealing awkward truths about the recent past in the fort.

Finally Mogs and Jack served arrest warrants on Vayamasu and Mrikitoi. This was nearly as dumb as Murugani's fight (M&M were nominally both in Red Dev, so I don't see Murugani getting much of a promotion in the near future, even if he lives) The net effect will now certainly involve charges against the players.

It really is about time that they guessed that more than one crime is being committed here. they have spotted the Black Arch, and have noted the theft. What has pased them by is the idea that the Flame radicals under Mirusiya have probably stolen it for their own benefit. The theft will throw all others into dispute ('is he affected?') and cause chaos in the minor legions. It will cause many to believe in a strong external enemy, and will give good grounds for a tightened state control of magic, borders, research and intelligence. 'Protective custody' of important persons will be a natural consequence.

Shame the players are so far off the track.

**What is going to happen next???**

In about one hour Xantori will have arrived in Chetro Ketl and will be waiting for the next cusp to allow travel to her sponsors in Fasiltum. She will spend the next few hours clearing off the tatoos, cutting her hair and generally applying makeup and new clothes. It will take about twenty hours for the nexus to be opened from the temple of Chiteng in Fasiltum. Unbeknownst to her the first thing she will see will be the hot end of a bolt or two, thus ending her contract. As she is not a complete dummy she will have hidden the key-box elsewhere in the city. She dies with a wry grin on her face, knowing that she has secretly cloned herself once more, and that one of her earlier offspring had the essential tool to open the key-box. (she doesn't know ChangLissa has this now)

After four hours the watch spot several ragged looking men moving into cover along the cliffs. They are only brigands, attracted by the smoke and disordered appearance of the troops, but they can manage to put up constant arrow, sling, rock and spear fire on any party leaving via the tracks. They can be put to flight easily, but will claim casualties, whom they will loot.

About five hours into the new game dozens of hlaka begin to arrive.

In about six hours the news will have reached the Imperial way station, and a sorcerous message will be projected to Vayamasu's room (Kintashmoi has arrangeed for maximum awkwardness by ensuring the news will reach many stability officers first...and as they don't really know waht has been going on...) The gist of the message is to pursue the thief, impound all property, secure all prisoners, await a full delegation. The down side is rations will only last about five days for this many troops, and not the month or too required.

In about eight hours the remnants of the party taken down by [O] will return from the underworld, with stories of ancient wonders. Only four have survived, with tales of a few minor nasties but not a lot else. They have found the tube way station and have

In about twelve hours the last clone hatches to full size with the true soul of Xantori'.She emerges from a hidden cell on an upper ledge in one of the rooms off the track to the tubeway. Naked and unarmoured, armed only with an eye of frigid breath and a small copper dagger she is aware that she has been betrayed by the radical militarists and wants revenge. She will work her way back up to the fort, seeking to enlist any non-military party people to her cause, in a careful way. She can offer the secret of the nano-tech body repair.

**Papers to discover in the library**

A reference to the 'Way Of The Judges' which states that the only other known routes by the other planes to Chetro Ketl are from the Imperial Tower in Avanthar or from the Governor's palace in Fasiltum.

A reference to the 'Pit' at Chetro Ketl.

In the notes made by Vayamasu is a reference to a room containing sarcophogi of the ancients. Treshki will recognise the description of flat metal trays, shaped like bars of soap, on which strange glass and metal coffins are balanced, as being similar to a few of the more basic air platforms he has seen. It is not a huge leap of logic to wondering if there are any batteries.

**A very quick summary of two weeks under ground**

Mog's character retired to the library, mumbling about the lack of military skill shown by the officers, clearly they lack sufficient flexibility to cope with novel problems.

The rest of them took a mob of troops down and cleared out the underworld. it is not necessary to describe the place in detail as the passage of so many troops scared off most of the wild life. The one ru'un, unable to leave because of legs rusted to the ground, did make a game show of defending his corner with a pot-rivet gun and an arc welding torch. A pile of rocks was placed over his last resting place.

The only light relief from the surgically precise action was Jack being introduced to the real Xantori, who had taken the precaution of regenerating a spare body in case the militarists betrayed her. Of course they did. Her true identity as a Black Y operative made the players realise that the real culoprits were probably beyond their reach, but they went on, via elevator and tubeway, to the City of Bowls just to see.

What they saw was a dead Xantori (mark I) and two searing flame warriors. They barely noticed the Vimuhla Sorc ('karendaz' hi liandar), so named for a tatoo he had done after a drunken night in Jakalla, before he was hacked down.

All returned safely, if a little sweaty because of thelack of air in the car, with the 'Mind Key' and its other component safely separated. (Too clever to fall for Xantori's idea to put them together, and thereby control half the party)

They returned to find Treshkoi, Kengitlen and Mrikitoi gone. They missed the little jolly when T and K went down to investigate the rumour of treasures with a wounded soldier. He was, of course, a Tsuru'u...and he nearly killed them and fed them to the little pedeth.
