Mystery fire in Jaikalor

Word has reached us of a terrible fire in the shanty town of Jaikalor. Fifty six are known to have perished, and twelve are unaccounted for; amongst them six young girls.

There is, as yet, no explanation for the sudden blaze. Local fire chief of the city militia, Somu hiBashani, repeated his call for the Governor to outlaw pitch and thatch roofs.

Stop press

Ahhogya anarchy, artist arrested.

This morning as we went to press we were told that the hitherto peaceable Ahhogya-cum-priest, Fulatom, went on a brief but spectacular rampage through the foreigners' quarter. A messenger of the general Karin Missum was seriously injured, but was later healed at the expense of Fulatom.

Apparently the messenger carried details of an appalling outrage committed by a Shen against some sacred relics of the Legion of the Dancer Without Eyes ( Currently stationed only 20 Tsan from here ).

Just what the problem is we don't know, but Fulatom is under "medical supervision" by half a dozen Thumis sorcerers, and is not expected to be released for two or three days.
