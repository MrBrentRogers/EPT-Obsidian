After Tsolyáni, Engsvanyáli receives the most detailed treatment of any language in the Tékumel canon. It has many features that do not exist in Tsolyáni, including vowel harmonization, inflected verbs, complex tenses, and use of a definite article. The PDF article on Engsvanyáli grammar also contains a long vocabulary list.

As discussed above, Engsvanyáli has many correspondences with its modern child languages. Correspondences to Terran languages are elusive, as they are with Tsolyáni.

Please note that the PDF article “The Grammar of Engsvanyáli” contains a serious error. The PDF describes the font as reversed but the font as depicted on the font map is in fact correct. The sample text, however, has been mistakenly flipped. This is clear by looking at the Engsvanyáli inscription in the Book of Ebon Bindings and also by comparing the Engsvanyáli glyphs with analogous glyphs in the child languages. For example, compare the Engsvanyáli “m” and “t” glyphs with Tsolyáni. Clearly, those letters are correct as written in the font map unreversed.
