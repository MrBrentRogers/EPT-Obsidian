The Tsolyani Modern Typeface
============================

This font is mainly derived from the notes in the Empire of the Petal
Throne gamebook.  A copy of this is recommended to understand how letters 
should be used.  Note that vowels are smaller than consonants, as they are 
normally written above or below the consonants.

The glyphs are mapped as follows.  Where a number is given, the character 
is produced by holding down the alt key and using the keypad.  So 128 is 
alt+128.  Characters that are undefined use the full-stop symbol.

Numbers 0-9 are mapped to the keyboard, as are the full-stop (period), the 
comma, and the question mark.

Limitations
============

1.	Some fonts automatically put the vowels over the consonants.  This 
font doesn't.
2.	Some versions of the Tsolyani script have extra glyphs for
letters that are independent.  These are not included.

How the font was made
=====================

1.	I used a scanner to read in the pages from EPT as TIFF files.  
Resolution isn't very crucial .  The work was done on a PC.

2.	The rest of the work was done in Corel Draw 4.0.  The TIFF file 
was read into Corel Paint, and Converted to Black-and-White two colour 
(under the Image menu), and saved as .BMP.  Everything other than the 
characters was wiped off at this stage.

3.	The .BMP was loaded into Corel Trace, and an outline trace 
requested by clicking on the icon.  All the characters were traced.  The 
file was saved as a .EPS file.

4.	A Font page was set up: 720 points, and the .EPS file imported.  
Each glyph was selected, and combined into one object if necessary.  
Everything else was removed, the object resized to fit the page, and 
Export to TrueType font selected.  This was repeated for each character in 
turn.  

That's it.
