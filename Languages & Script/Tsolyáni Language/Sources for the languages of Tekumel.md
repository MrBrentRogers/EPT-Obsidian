those three items are the sources for Tsolyani. Dr. Barker has a also published essays on several other languages of Tekumel. All are now for sale at DriveThruRPG.com. I copied the text blurbs for them here:

Bednalljan - The Script of the First Imperium
Bednalljan - The Script of the First Imperium reveals the language of the time before Pavar, during the reign of Queen Nayari of the Silken Thighs and her court in Jakalla. Related to languages such as Irzakh and Engsvanyali, Bednalljan provides insight into a time long ago, far in the distant past - and yet still relevant to the Five Empires today. This is a careful introduction for more advanced players and is useful for every Tekumel campaign. 11 pages.

The Grammar of Engsvanyali 
The Grammar of Engsvanyali is an introduction to the language of the Priest-Kings of Ganga, who held sway over all of the Five Empires and beyond for thousands of years. This article is a companion to the History of Engsvan hla Ganga (also available), and illuminates the time of the Engsvanyali Empire: "Engsvanyali was 'pinned in place' by the Scrolls of Pavar. The Priestkings declared that these had been 'given by the Gods' and could not be altered in the slightest way. 'What existed before must exist forever after,' as the adage says."ù And yet now the Engsvanyali are gone - what can their language tell us? This is a careful introduction for more advanced players and is useful for every Tekumel campaign. 53 pages.
	
The Grammar of Livyani
The Grammar of Livyani is an exploration of the language of the secretive Empire of Livyanu, home of the Shadow Gods. Included in this carefully written treatise is an example of the poetry of Marya of Tsamra, the great poet of the ancient capital of Llyan. Included in this netbook addition is an index, this article is a thorough introduction for more advanced players and is useful for every Tekumel campaign. 30 pages.

The Grammar of Yan Koryani
The Grammar of Yan Koryani is an examination of this most distantly related language of the Khishan language group - and the tongue of Baron AÅld's delicately forged alliance against the Empire of the Petal Throne. Inside, you will find the text of a letter of introduction and safe passage from Baron AÅld himself, as well as examples of the blocky script used by the folk of the northern lands. Included in this netbook addition is an index, this article is a thorough introduction for more advanced players and is useful for every Tekumel campaign. 19 pages.

The Tongue of Those Who Journey Beyond: Sunuz
The Tongue of Those Who Journey Beyond: Sunuz is not merely an article about one of the arcane languages of the Five Empires, rather "[i]t is intended as a 'consciousness-raiser': a means of introducing scholars to the study of the Pariah Deities." This dissertation on the language of Sunuz provides a glimpse of the deeper recesses of The World of Tekumel and the Planes Beyond. It will deepen your understanding of other books for the World of Tekumel, including The Book of Ebon Bindings and the Compendium of the Gods, Mitlanyal. 64 pages.
