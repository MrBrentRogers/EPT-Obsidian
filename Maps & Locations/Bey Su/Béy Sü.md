This is the "map" (the nearest thing the Tsolyáni have to a map) of the city of Béy Sü. This was  
originally published as the cover illustration to "Empire of the Petal Throne."  
The text at the bottom right says:  

| Saváldálidhálisakoi                      | The great, beauteous, and powerful city |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| hi                                       | of                                      |
| Béy Síy (1)                              | Béy Sü                                  |
| Pandár hiPúrdimal moyí müni              | Pandár of Púrdimal made                 |
| másuntlacháni ngá lél dhálin guál dopál. | This picture-map and it is beautiful.   |
| Fésru 27, 2,328                          | [Month of] Fésru 27, 2,328 [A.S.]       |
(1) The spelling of "Béy Síy" instead of "Béy Sü" is archaic. This originates in Classical Tsolyáni  
times and is obsolete today. 

The artist, Pandár hiVaisonér of the clan of the Cloak of Azure Gems of the city of Púrdimal was a  
court painter at Avanthár for many years. He specialised in this sort of "city picture-maps," in  
which various traditional icons (the priest, the merchant, soldiers, the priestess, Lord Missúm  
(Death), peasants, etc.) were depicted larger than life, standing in those city districts they  
traditionally occupied. Pandár died in 2,361.  

The crescent-shaped icon at the feet of the two soldiers (one Shén and one human) in the centre of the picture has /chalu kolumébabàr/ "for the Imperium" blazoned upon it -- but without the  
vowel diacritics. This is a common artistic practice.  

The glyphs shown on building walls are artistic squiggles. In reality, inscriptions on such walls  
tend to be ornate and lengthy -- and are usually written in Classical Tsolyáni or else in elaborate  
calligraphy.
