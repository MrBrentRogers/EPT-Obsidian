Béy Sü - "the Soul of the World"

# Béy Sü

"the Soul of the World", "the Center of the World and Capital of the Cosmos"![](<the Soul of the World.webp>)

_Béy Sü - "the Soul of the World", Illustration by MAR Barker_

This is the "map" (the nearest thing the Tsolyáni have to a map) of the city of Béy Sü. This was  
originally published as the cover illustration to "Empire of the Petal Throne."  
The text at the bottom right says:  

| Saváldálidhálisakoi                      | The great, beauteous, and powerful city |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| hi                                       | of                                      |
| Béy Síy (1)                              | Béy Sü                                  |
| Pandár hiPúrdimal moyí müni              | Pandár of Púrdimal made                 |
| másuntlacháni ngá lél dhálin guál dopál. | This picture-map and it is beautiful.   |
| Fésru 27, 2,328                          | [Month of] Fésru 27, 2,328 [A.S.]       |
(1) The spelling of "Béy Síy" instead of "Béy Sü" is archaic. This originates in Classical Tsolyáni  
times and is obsolete today. 

The artist, Pandár hiVaisonér of the clan of the Cloak of Azure Gems of the city of Púrdimal was a  
court painter at Avanthár for many years. He specialised in this sort of "city picture-maps," in  
which various traditional icons (the priest, the merchant, soldiers, the priestess, Lord Missúm  
(Death), peasants, etc.) were depicted larger than life, standing in those city districts they  
traditionally occupied. Pandár died in 2,361.  

The crescent-shaped icon at the feet of the two soldiers (one Shén and one human) in the centre of the picture has /chalu kolumébabàr/ "for the Imperium" blazoned upon it -- but without the  
vowel diacritics. This is a common artistic practice.  

The glyphs shown on building walls are artistic squiggles. In reality, inscriptions on such walls  
tend to be ornate and lengthy -- and are usually written in Classical Tsolyáni or else in elaborate  
calligraphy.

This was drawn by Professor Barker and depicts some of his early concepts for Tékumel (such as the "heater" shield ([[#^[2]]]|Comment #[ 2]]) with the medieval-inspired heraldry on it!)

There are text descriptions in the first of the Adventures on Tékumel solo books (blue cover) and in the Man of Gold novel. Based upon the description in the solo book I did the following sketch map, trying to reconcile the text with the EPT box illustration.

![](<Béy Sü - Sketch.webp>)

The box art doesn't show the outer ring wall, that of Emperor Hejjéka V, the "open-handed", but it could easily just be out of frame to the South. I have taken the southernmost bastion on the eastern side of the river to be a sákbe road fortress at the entrance to the two roads leading to Fasiltúm and Thráya. The box art doesn't show the wall to the north of the city either leading to the question whether it extends all the way around. The wall shown in the art is undoubtedly Patyél’s mighty wall.

In this sketch I assumed that the central citadel is the Governor's palace with the "walled gardens" beyond. This arrangement appears to differ from the Man of Gold text, which places the Governor's palace north of the city and surrounded by gardens. Looking at the box art there certainly seems to be a forested patch immediately north of the city. Could this be the southern part of the Governor's vast gardens? Perhaps the citadel that dominates the central part of Béy Sü in the box art is not the governor's palace at all, and that edifice is an even more imposing structure not shown? Could it be that the fortress shown is the "Pyramid of Ssirandár III"? The Professor was well known for using terms in unconventional manners - his use of the word "pyramid" is not meant to connotate to that used to house Egypt's Pharaohs and he frequently uses the terms "many-legged serpent" and "worm" to describe things that are neither snakes nor worms!

There seems to be an island just north of the walled gardens. Presumably part of the Governor's palace gardens as no structures are shown, though admittedly they could be out of frame to the north. Possibly the location of another Imperial Prison - Jakálla has many prisons, why not the capital?

The descriptions I have found [are there others?] are missing some locations: the Foreigner's Quarter, for one; and the numerous barracks for the other legions headquartered in the city; also the other temples. The Man of Gold text seems to indicate that the Temple of Thúmis - the Temple of Eternal Knowing - is within the city and not on the eastern bank as stated in the solo game book description. Possibly there are two temples, or perhaps it is just a temple to Lord Keténgku, the cohort of Thúmis. To me, it does make sense for the temple of Keténgku to be located out of the city. I imagine it to be a Great Hospital, if the Tsolyáni have such things(?), located away from the stink and contamination of the city.

There are two, possibly three other gates not shown - at least, there are three other sákbe roads: to Haumá in the south-west, to Tsurú in the north-west and to Avanthár in the north.

The gate in the outer wall used in the solo book (the road to Usenánu) is also not named.

From the text of the solo book description one can determine that the sákbe road "faces" west - that is, its high side looks to the west, with its low side facing the river. This is known because the text describes the character being able to see the sákbe roads on the opposite shore and this would only be possible from the upper parapet otherwise. As that level is reserved for the guards, high officials and imperial messengers, the low side must face the river. There is no indication how the other roads are aligned, but I suspect that the southbound road to Thráya faces the river, while that to Fasiltúm faces to the south-east. The northern road to Avanthár [I think] would face west, the road to Tsurú, south-west and that to Haumá south. This assumes Mu'ugalavyá to be the greatest threat and thus the one they would be facing towards.

I have it on good authority that my sketch map of Béy Sü matches with that of Professor Barker's in a great many features. My speculation about the location of the governor's palace is wrong however. Apparently the text I was referring to was speaking more figuratively than literally.

Of course, the Professor's Map has a large number of details not described elsewhere, including a lake. The sakbe roads are laid out in better detail and the confusion over the Temple of Thúmis is cleared up. It lies right next to the Quarter of the Shroud Makers and so it is reasonable for the sounds of city life to be heard from the temple dormitories.

# Béy Sü - Places of Note

![[bey su -map colour.webp]]
## I. Village of Haikolum

This village began as a typical agricultural community over 500 years ago. Its three crops a year were made possible by the climate and augmented by the priesthood of Avanthe who use spells to increase the growth and fertility of grain, etc. for a few Qirgal a sack. Having grown up near a centre such as Béy Sü however, the villagers found that the occasional excavation of some forgotten artifact or edifice in the fields brought an overpopulation of zealots, religious personnel, etc. who drained the economy of foodstuffs and manpower in searches spanning weeks. Nowadays, the rare finds of useless or interesting items are quietly reported to the village Headman (Tso: Laithturunkoi) whose prowess at identifying the “owners” has led to many villagers’ houses being rebuilt from wooden to brick construction and not a few families (including the headman’s) sporting clothing made of Gudru cloth rather than the usual Firya kilt and tunic.

Notes: Its economy had begun to diversify with the legion caravans nearby…!
## II. Fortress and Barracks of Ku-Kelkusa
These are the barracks of the Legion of the Portals of Death, noted mainly for its part in a fiction whereby Emperor Gyesmu had a history fabricated for it (he needed troops). The legion was subsequently dishonored and disbanded on this being learned by Emperor Hetkolainen (the current Emperor’s grandfather) who then reinstated it with the same personnel and name as a “new” legion! (Such is the Tsolyani love for tradition and decorum!) The commander, Lord Meshmuyel hiVu’urtesh worships Hnalla from the Golden Bough Clan. He wants to take the Legion to the frontier and has connections with Muresh hiQdyelmu, also a worshipper of Hnalla and Golden Bough. Lord Muresh, however, is commandant of the Omnipotent Azure Legion in Béy Sü nad has helped pass these requests along but nothing has come of it yet.
## III. The Foreigners’ Quarter

### 1. Shen Enclave
Blunt and forthright, Shen merchants stop here en route to/from other areas of the Empire. They often have a deal of some small wares, gems, etc., but one must beware the customs between egg-groups such as parts of the enclave are closed to other parts. To the Shen, this is a natural product of hostile egg-groups and to be borne (besides they usually leave in a few days/weeks). To a human it’s confusion.

### 2. Ahoggya Enclave
Besides the availability of a number of weapon shops, etc., for sale to the mercenaries and legions, the Ahoggya support a small number of merchants of their own. It should be remembered however, that these creatures bear a tremendous distaste for thieves and cheats and exhibit a justice all their own.

### 3. Hlaka Enclave
The sardonic and sometimes malicious humor of these little beings makes diplomacy a must in dealing with them. This enclave helps to support the legions of Hlaka far to the North as well as numerous groups living in the cliffs near Avanthar, for Hlaka do not stay forever in one place. Thus, numerous “visitors” fly in and out as this or that group decides to go visit the homeland or another group (legion, etc.) Some valuable objects can be garnered here as the little flyers often obtain unique treasures (by unique means). They are also purveyors of interesting information, considering their viewpoint (aerial).

### 4. Pe Choi Enclave
Most nearly adaptable to human norms and abilities, these Pe Choi can often be found on missions similar to adventurers occupations identical to (and often among) humans and interesting compatible with human norms (money, etc.). This being said, it is also possible (though rare) to find those in the enclave with interests of an alien nature. Parts of the enclave resemble human housing while other areas resemble the alien homes, low rounded domed structures of chitinous or other material. Although most capable of emulating the dignity and abilities of the highest of men, the Pe Choi psychology and racial empathy holds a loneliness deeper than any could understand, a loneliness of being sundered from a home world millenia ago and a dimension spanning distance away.

### 5. Tinaliya (and other nonhuman) Enclave
The literal-minded logic of these little beings has been focused on human culture for some time. Their interest has maintained scientific legations in almost every major city in the Five Empires. Most people in Béy Sü come to this enclave for the excellent craftsmanship of water-clocks, sextants, etc., in fact anything one wants for a price. The studious attitude of these beings and their relatively peaceful nature ensure their coexistence with other nonumans such as the crafty Pygmy Folk of the North (who become middlemen in more than one deal) or the rare Swamp Folk (between sea voyages). Should danger threaten however, it is probable that the little folk will buy the assistance of nonhuman or human bodyguards with a well-made mechanism or a few well-earned Kaitars (and watch out for those well-made traps…!)

### 6. Hostel of Unmarred Repose
The Clan is the most important social unit in the Five Empires. For those who can, a letter of introduction from their home city or Religion (or other, such as a legion) will often suffice to gain them a bed in a village, when entering a city, they should seek out their clan and stay at the clanhouse. Of course, not all clans exist in all cities and not all members may with to stay there to answer questions or be talked about (especially in secrecy is required). For those citizens and for well born (upper class foreigners exists the House (Hostel) of the Unmarred Repose. Money is not the case here, even Tlakotani or Vriddi clansmen without great amounts of kaitars may stay a night or two (if they can pay) while merchants, slavers, etc., of even the richest means will be turned away. Meals are of breads, pastries, several meats (poultry, fish, etc.), vegetable stews, sauces, condiments (domestic and foreign) and various confections. Drink, is similarly varied, but always paid for (one could do no less and maintain their status!). Available spaces include well-furnished rooms with woven reed carpets, backrests scattered about, cushions aplenty, low tables, candelabra, trays, chests, and sleeping mats. For wealthier patrons, suites of such rooms with tapestries, murals and sculptures abound. Depending on one’s means a private or shared bath chamber is available. Such chambers can resemble swimming pools wherein slaves scrub one with soap and a cool dip rinses body and soul. All other areas in the foreign quarters bear aspects of this, but all are lower in quality and safety. Some foreign clansmen have opened small “houses” of various sorts of those from their land/clan. Many are safe, more are of dubious virtue. Such are the perils of travel!

### 7. Hostels and Shops of the Foreigners’ Quarter
Many of dubious quality. Many poorer businesses are run in these areas to escape the competition or other requirements outside the Foreigners’ Quarter. Hostels and Winemakers clanhouses not only sell their culinary wares but are open for rental to the occasional party or celebration. These are mainly of foreign persons, as anyone of better station will find a place outside the quarter in the city precincts. Public drinking rooms exist only in the most ignoble places among those with nothing to lose, never mind status.

## IV. Square of the Reception of Azure
This large area is most often used a drill area and congregation spot for the various military needs of the three Barracks nearby. It has been used (and will be again) as a place to celebrate victories whenever the legions nearby defeat their enemies in the North. In the meantime, various recruitment and supply trains organize and embark for the front.

## V. Barracks of the Legion of Lord Kaingmra, the Imperial Artillery
At present only two cohorts call this home, manning and maintaining the engines of their craft on the city walls. Yet, the barracks is busy, as long trains of supplies leave another column of recruits arrive. The majority of the legion is in Tumissa and well supplied there, but Béy Sü and Tumissa barracks must resupply those manning Chene Ho whose worth was proven recently as they met the ill-timed Mu’uglavyani attack and held until General Kettukal come out of the North and sent the Red Hats packing. Although newly organized, the legion is supported by the Golden Bough Clan and the Temple of Karakan. Lord Kaingmra hiZhnaya has wisely put veterans from other artillery units in command of each his groups and although aging, still has time to work intrigues in the Royalist cause. He is an ally of Lord Muresh and Lord Meshmuyel, commander of the “Portals of Death”.

## VI. Barracks of the Legion of the Splendour of Shényu, 4th Imperial Auxiliary Heavy Legion
Legions within the Empire have a life above and beyond those of the individuals comprising it and is more true of the nonhuman Shen who comprise this legion. Most Shen leave their homeland to “adventure” and learn various skills when young, rarely staying more than 2-3 years. Thus, the face of this legion is constantly changing in war or peace. Presently all the legion cohorts are in the Northwest (Khirgar, Chene Ho, Si’is) supporting Kettukal hiMraktine and Prince Eselne against the Yan Koryani and Mu’ugalavyani. As with other legions, the barracks are alive with supply and training maneuvers.

## VII. Fort of the Fifth Death
Although its name is unusual and obscure, there are some who associate it and the ill-starred Legion of the Sier Lighting, and the city guard who man the fort. Resulting in many back alley brawls.

## VIII. Barracks of the Legion of the Clan of the Silver Lightning
Also called the “Regiment”, home of the 7th Imperial Archers. Its reputation of bad luck is well known. Present this Vimuhla worshipping legion is far to the North, following its nonhuman (Pachi Lei) general in the service of Prince Mirusia. As there are few to no slaves, the splendidly built barracks (from better times) is sparsely populated to save the usual supply columns that pass through.

## VIIIa. Small shops residences (middle class)

## VIIb. Gate of Spikes

## IX. Barracks of the Legion of Potent Destiny
At first a place for those waiting to join the Omnipotent Azure Legion (OAL), but this legion has begun to assert itself. As an ancient rival of the OAL, the drive to excel has had the legion move northward to cover for the vacancies of the Vimuhla cohorts under Prince Miruseya. The Sea Blue clan has made the barracks a hum of activity, which has leveled off somewhat with cohorts send north, and the activity now is to resupply and support.
## IXa. Business Clans (Shops, etc.)

## IXb. Market Square
Smaller than the Great Market.
## X. Barracks of the Legion of Hnalla, Master of Light
All but five cohorts of this full-strength legion have moved out to Khirgar, supporting Prince Eslne’s armies. The general of this legion is none-other than Aknallu hiTikeshmu, high priest of Hnalla at Bey Su, and one of the leaders of the Priestly Party! Notwithstanding this, his lineage is collateral with lineages of the Tikeshmu name in the Clans of the Iron Fist and White Crystal (and others). This not only allows pressures to come to bear from numerous quarters when he wishes, but assures the ease of resupplying his legion.
## XI. Tower and Monastery of Azure Peace, dedicated to the Goddess Avanthe
Just off the map to the west, this splendid edifice houses the wives and entourages of the God-Emperor of Tsolyanu. It is here that the once-youthful ladies whom the Emperor has chosen return to bear his children and live out their lives in luxury. It is also where many who seek wisdom come, for to have known Avanthar, even briefly, is to have acquired wisdom above the norm.
## XIa. City Prison
Less dangerous criminals are kept here awaiting trial or its aftermath (slavery, impalement, etc.). See Barracks of the Legion of Ketl for more info.
## XII. Temple of Chegarra
Temples in Bey Su are never small and this one is no exception. From military needs, housing, and other mundane necessities of administering temple lands throughout the Empire, to the great towering roof-combs and tunkel gong towers, the place spans nearly 1200 sq. miles. THe Grand Adept, Lord Raimane hiVorodlayu of the Golden SUnburst Clan, is young and zealous. His frequent trips to Avanthar may have something to do with the ordering of further troops to the N.W. Frontier in support of Prince Eselne.
## XII. Temple of Chiteng
Another grand temple. Actually, these are not so much single edifices as grand collections of buildings and arenas of different uses. Some of the rituals in these arenas, it has been said, “frighten the carapace from an Ahoggya”. Although flame-worship is not centred in Bey Su, the temple grounds are well-made and ancient. Their undeniable interest in the Hirilakte Arena is evidenced by the proximity thereof. Of course, temple facilities are kept busier than usual by the needs of their Prince, leading the forces of Vimuhla to glorious victory in the North!
## XIV. Temple of Dra
The pursuits of the abstract thinkers of this religion make this temple somewhat less than splendid. Although occupying nearly as much space as any of the temples from the Cohorts, only the presence of level-headed Tsolyani artisans, mercantillers, and servants seems to keep the bureaucracy so essential to such an edifice functional. SHould a scholar ever get admittance to the great libraries and have the esoteric means to understand the philosophies therein, it is still doubtful if this would be any permanent good, for the priest of Dra do not concern themselves with this world.
## XV. Barracks of the Legion Kaikama
These barracks are inhabited only by the cohort in training and those unfit for service on the Northeast Frontier with Prince Miruseya. Lord Kaikama has indeed turned out to be a brilliant general, despite his (and his legions) sexual predilections. Rumors of his victories abound, from the defeat he inflicted on the Milumanayani only a few years ago, to his rumored movements in Saa Allaq and the Dry Bay of Ssum. He is also rumored to have allied with General Mnashu and the two are supposed to be single-handedly destroying Salarvya, Saa Allaq and Yan Kor! Despite this, the heir of Mnashu continues to trickle toward Eselne’s frontier and the caravans still leave for the legion of Kaikama at a frantic pace. “Nothing is certain” says the Pygmy Folk, “ but death and talkses”.
## XVa. Lake Tsamkolel
Only Bey Su could support a lake like this and only the wealthy can keep it interesting with their myriad watercraft. The rest of the city uses the wells for water and the banks of the lake for washing (and some water-herbs).
## XVI. Barracks of the Legion of the Mighty Prince
Manned only by a training cohort, these barracks still see the calm mechanism of a well-oiled supply depot in action. They are after all, minions of the greatest Prince in Tsolyanu (as they see it). Prince Eselne even has these men involved in his move to destroy the Yan Koryani and earn the gold. Numerous visitors from the military party pass through daily, sometimes meeting with clans and factions of other sorts in order to bring the best deal for their Prince.
## XVII. Temple of Gruganu
Maintained and ordered to perfection, this temple complex is committed to the assistance of Prince Mridobu (at least outwardly) and has had many years of practice. One of their most potent members, Lord Sryqu hiTankalel of the Great Stone Clan now serves as Legate of the Palace of the Realm in Bey Su. Another member, Dr, Chekrash is physician to the Imperial Court at Bey Su (and sorcerous mentor to Princess Ma’in).
## XVIIa. Gate of Western Glory

## XVIII. Temple of Wuru
This temple complex has conducted its rituals, made the sacrifices, and administered lands since Bey Su was founded. Its members (with many in the Dark Trinity) have been content to concern themselves with this amount of worldly travail and concentrate their studies elsewhere. Recently, however, there has come a tug upon temple resources as the Hekellu contingent sent its legion halfway across the Empire to support General Kettukal in the Northwest. The fondest hopes of the priesthood now lie in the Legion of the Many-Legged Serpent staying at Mrelu as long as it did at Hekellu and letting them get back to more important work!

## XVIIIa. Hill of Pots
This hill’s name implies the nature of the work of the houses and shops atop it, who find material and support of each pottery or glass work business an advantage.
## XIX. Unknown Pyramid
Just another of the things good Tsolyani ignore, it quickens the heartbeat of many a low-class person or foreigner and services as a means of monetary gain for the mapsellers and guides in the marketplace. Similar in size and shape to the Pyramid of Ssirandar II nearby, it serves as a reminder that Bey Su was not the first monument to man built atop the Berenanga Plain.. Albeit the most visible. Many have tried through the centuries to unravel these and other secrets. Few have found it profitable, and some have never been heard of again!  
  
The Unknown Pyramid is secretly the Ebon Pyramid mentioned in the Epic of Hrugga and is a three-sided structure of orbicular diorite. It predates the building of the city and in-fact is the reason the city was built at all.

## XX. Village of Miyussa
Similar to the Village of Haikolum, its economy has also diversified to include some of the trades found in the suburbs. In a few years, it may be part of those same residential neighborhoods.
## XXa. Gate of Durumu, “the Copper Blade of Sarku”

## XXI. Village of Hurul
In reality, more of a “Sakbe Road” village than its other two counterparts, Hurul also supplies some of the needs of the Tolek Kan Pits. Its citizens are of necessity more taciturn than most…
## XXII. Barracks of the Legion of Ketl
The legion with more than the regulation 20 cohorts, these soldier guard the prisons across the Imperium. Normally commanded by Lord Arkhane hiPurushqe of Sea Blue Clan, and worshiper of Belkhanu, the legion has recently become involved in the manipulations of Prince Dhich’une. This has caused concern and the Legion’s practice of recruiting by press gang has been sharply curtailed by other elements of the Empire. A regular day will see these barracks abustle as guards are changed for the Tolek Kana Pits (outside the city), regular duties are carried out and the “recruits” are trained.The hereditary clan of these people is Hand of Compassion (Very Low Clan).
## XXIII. Tolek Kana Pits
Very few ever escape this, the mightiest of the Imperial prisons. From the smallest pits to the grandest suites, those who have committed crimes against the Imperium (and have not been impaled) are here incarcerated. In some cases they remain here in relative luxury, with their families, their clan, or some other benefactor having arranged it. In other cases, prisoners are placed in pits which allow standing only with grates above and below (with food slopped in from above). Then too, the presence of Prince Dhich’une often complicates the lives of not a few prisoners who must provide the worm sustenance, or embark upon underworld journeys that would grey the hair of the strongest men.
## XXIV. Temple of Avanthe
Built across the river from Bey Su, the doffess’ Temple (whose aspect is of nature) has a site well-suited to her worship. With a ferry assigned to the temple via the Passage of the Ship of Avanthe, contact with the City is both maintained and uplifted through this near-ritual passage. The fortunes of the temple have recently been raised with the revelation of Dilinala’s new Imperial Princess. Until now, the temple (which has a strong monopoly on the economy via use of fertility spells) has been a power without a cause, as their own Princess Ma’in converted to another religion.
## XXIVa. Passage of the Ship of Lady Avanthe
This is the Ferry assigned to the movement of Avanthe’s worshippers from the City to the temple, vice versa, and to aid those in passing on their own business as long as they are with the Goddess or her Cohort. Of course there is a donation expected from each who passes…
## XXV. Palace of Ever-Glorious War
Serving as Administration, Recruitment, and Logistics to the many legions of the Imperium, this is one of the nexus points of power. The Hall of Recruiting in Bey Su is the largest in the Imperium. There, from various podia and niches, retired officers proclaim the benefits and greatness of their legion “like hucksters at a fair”. Once joined, the recruit trains, then either goes to the Legion (when needing replacements) or home (as militiaman - “on call” for 5 years). At times one will gain a glimpse of the more esoteric legionaries, the magic users who can use their books and produce ensorcellment great and small for their army. One may as well glimpse one or another of the personages of power who determine the destiny of the armies in Strategic Planning centres, rooms well prepared for this work. As with the temples, this Palace has numerous outlying areas and buildings for all manner of reasons: the victory parades to latrine duty. Besides finding generals of legions based within the city (presently, only Ketl, Hnalla’s Legion and Portals of Death might have generals here), there are always officers of numerous legions on the front here at work administering and acquiring recruits and supplies.
## XXVI. Palace of The Realm
Here exists one of the most immense bureaucracies in the world. Over 10,000 years of social development has gone into its making. Where other aspects of the culture such as technology can be said to have lagged since the Time of Darkness, this aspect can only be said to have developed! Thus the groups listed below it must be remembered, are superior to other leadership methods used in history.

Being as this is not only the Palace that controls the city, but on another level the Province of Beranange and yet again, the administration (in part) of the entire Empire! Thus, it is seen that this is a unique administration. The Palace itself is only part of the complex, the Governor’s Palace and administration buildings completing the picture. The Grand Legate of the Palace, Lord Sruqu hiTankolel is one of the leaders of the Royalist Party.
## XXVII. Palace of Foreign Lands
In many ways this palace seems not to be essential in central location and in many ways it is true that the duties here must be different from those nearest the borders, yet as it has been seen, river traffic provides some concern and the proximity if the Emperor (hence delegations from other countries) makes the most work for this administration. From the negotiation of contracts to the location of facilities for dignitaries, the members of this Palace must be the most well-trained and versatile in customs and diplomacy.
The structure of this palace and of the other administrative work (Palace of the Realm, Priesthoods, and the military Palace of Ever-Glorious War) is toward a central court surrounded by dias’ or perhaps similar to a great theatre of ascending levels upon which rests the (visible) hierarchy of each department in ascending order (lowest to highest in more ways than one!). At the top rests the offices of the various heads with their staff. To get one from the bottom to the head requires a lot of power or a lot of inducements (ascending the levels and increasing in amount!). Luckily, one seldom needs to personally see the bosses, as the proper amount of inducement and polite conversation will usually get a missive up the ranks in good time (shortened by inducements).
## XXVII. Palace of the Priesthoods
In some ways comparable to the Civil Administration, this Palace is more complicated. Remember that the same sorts of administrative work must be maintained for temple properties and lands within the city, province and across the Empire, multiplied by 20 (for each temple), and you will have some idea of the complexity involved (and many temples are hostile to each other)! Further, each temple is divided into Ritual, Administrative, and Military groups which may function more or less similarly to civil units described elsewhere. A description of general categories for Thumis and Vimuhla follow.

The temple of Thumis has never been much for war, nevertheless owing to human nature Guards and Military aspects are required and are as follows: From Acolyte-Warrior-Officers (commissioned and non-commissioned), Kasi (captain), Force Commander (individual temples). The ranks of the priesthood also start at the pool of Acolytes and onto (Ritual ranks in parentheses); Priest-Clerk (Ritual-Priest), Department Head (Chief Ritual), Temple Commandant (High Ritual), District Commander (Grand High), Regional Commander (Preceptor). From here, Regional Commanders, and one higher Ritual rank (High Preceptor) sit on the High Council. There are other routes of course, and the Scholarly Hierarchy is one such (the Lay priest or Wizard is yet another).

The temple of Vimuhla bears a similar method for Administration and Ritual work, thus it is their military aspect that holds the most interest.

Acolytes (lower level) - Priests-Military Priests-Military Admin-Ranks (Captain and up). Temple Priests require a route through Acolyte and Priesthood, then diverge into Administrative and Ritual routes. Ignoring the fourteen types of Ritual Priest leading to Chief and High Ritual, the Administrative category represents a hierarchy from clerks through department heads, then commandant of temples from village to metropolis (and regional), years and decades of toil.

And all this multiplied by twenty in one building. Still, the Tsolyani penchant for order divides these groups and places each ascending rank upon ascending dias’ neatly so as to visibly ascertain one’s route if not one’s needs or amount of inducement.
## XXIX. Barracks of the Tomb Police
In a culture that has developed the kind of order that this one has, it should be expected that not only do the Tsolyani order their graveyards but they build the proper city-like tomb complexes and hire police to guard them. Of course, like many other things hereditary clans serve here, such as the Wicker Image and Nighted Tower (both very low clans). With proper inducements, one can be allowed to ‘visit’ a tomb or 2, giving the image that these clans support tomb-robbers (malicious rumor). Without inducement or if of improper religion (tomb police tend to be of Sarku), beware!
## XXX. Temple of Ksarul
It takes no great investigation to know that this temple represents not only the legitimate means of channeling rebellion in the Imperium, but is one of the means by which the technology of the ancients is recovered and new ‘technology’ of sorcery development. Some important members include; Lord Tsutel hiVoruseka (19th circle admin High Priest, Great Stone Clan), Lord Quren hiKetkolel (same clan, High Ritual Priest), Lord Kerektu hiKhanmu (Dark Flame clan, head of Archive of the Indigo Tower - one of the greatest libraries) and occasionally Lord Ssurusa hiKetkolel (from Avanthar, Great Stone clan, High Priest and Mridobu’s minion) whose visits are interesting…
## XXXI. Temple of Hru’u
As the nominal head of the Lords of Change (the Tlokiriqaluyal) this temple has responsibility for the furthering of not just their own interests but of Change itself. Of course, not all of the other temples share this view… Wily old Mirigga hiCulumesa the High Priest has not only managed to juggle these diversified interest, but get his opposite numbers of Hnalla to entertain some profitable ventures for the Priests Party as well.
## XXXII. Temple of Karakan
This temple is one of the few who do not value secrecy (indeed, this is ‘Ignoble’). Thus their societies are public and obviously warrior. The best known is the ‘Clan of the Sword of Righteousness’, but others include; Brethren of Scarlet, Seekers of Foes, Soldiers of the Dawning Sun, and Righteous Ones of the Arching Shaft. Grand Adept is Lord Tikkune hiMraktine (Sea Blue Clan, 70 yrs old, Military Party supporter) who supports Lord Nrinelu hiJarash (Blade Raised High Clan, 43 yrs old, scholar-priest and expert on sorcery) a member of the Omnipotent Azure Legion who works against Mridobu in Avanthar itself.
## XXXIII. Temple of Hrihayal
Although the temple would normally be expected to maintain the Red Light district of the city (it does), it is often surprising to see them involved in Imperial politics to the extent they are. Princess Ma’in is one of the forces that drives this religion, of course. Although considered too weak in skill and support to win the ‘Gold’, her politics are supported and powered to gain her faction a position with the winner or see her enemies fail. Already one of her priestesses is Eselne’s lover and another curries favor with Miruseya. She has recently received a devastating setback with the revelation of Princess Arimala, whose Dilinala faction has given new hope to those of Avanthe (previously allied with Ma’in).
## XXXIV. Temple of Shiringgaya
Although a Salarvyani goddess, this deity represents an amalgam of the female goddesses of Tsolyanu. The traders of Salarvya are only one of the reasons for the presence of this temple. Remembering the Bednalljan connections from previous ages (prior to and through the Engsvanyali Imperium) and their counterparts in the Royalist Party, it isn’t hard to determine the usefulness of the temple. Put this together with numerous clans whose members exist in both Tsolyanu and Salarvya and the present Toslyani need for produce (and manpower) due to the war, and you have the latest in detente. The final word should develop as Arimala (princess)exerts her faction’s connections (across borders).
## XXV. Barracks of the Market Police and City Guard
(see Great Market) The City Guard can be found throughout the streets of Bey Su (save certain unsavory quarters) and at the Gates. The various groups of guards will vary in skill and quality (see Patyel’s Wall) of course, but unless there is trouble only the amount of inducement will give a clue as to the guard’s ability (and some are better at economics!).
## XXVI. Temple of Belkanu
This is the deity to whom many of the worshipers of Stability look to for guidance among the Planes and the road to the Land of the Dead. As a consequence the Temple is charged with the responsibility of funerals and entombment of not just their own sect. This makes this temple one of the busiest in the city. There are a number of celebrations and duties in which Bey Su sees the participation of minions of this deity.
## XXXVII. Temple of Hnalla
As with Hru’u the Duties and functions of the First god of Stability make this a more active temple than most. One of the most impressive sights in the Imperium, the great golden ‘Disk of Blazing Light’ sits in this temple (a gift of the Emperor Nu’unka). For the scholarly, the study of the history of the Engsvanyali Imperium is best undertaken here, if one can persuade one of the learned to give aid. As has been noted elsewhere, cunning Aknallu hiTikeshum has the power and connections to manipulate even his opposite number of Hru’u in Priestly Party intrigues.
## XXXVIII. Temple of Dilinala

This temple has received most of the attention in Bey Sy of late. Princess ARimala is the newest of the recognized children of Emperor Hirkane Tlakotani. Her upbringing as a sculptress in the Singing Bird clan of Khirgar would at first appear unsubstantial until one looks at the alternative - Ma’in. Thus, watching these 2 scions of the Imperium. To date, Arimala has proven as cunning and perhaps wiser than Ma’in, though this has been attributed to her ‘handlers’. Something that should not be uttered in the presence of High Priestess Dijaya hiQurruluma, General of the Legion of the Sapphire Kirtle. This clear thinking leader of the Bey Sy temple has rebuilt the legion given her (altering their purpose as well - almost unthinkable - and a tribute to her determination) and leads them in the Northwest as part of Eselne’s campaign. Her need for supplies causes her to establish a route of mutual clan support and obligation through Tsolyanu and into Salarvya.
## XXXIX. Temple of Vimuhla
Although the centres of flame-worship are to the East and in the West, the presence of Prince Miruseya on the Northeast Front makes the supply and power of this temple most essential. The current renovations owe more to the work of the Grand Adept Lord Nayuri hiTukkimchash, of Red Mountain clan, than the project as well. Strangely enough, his brother is a senior in the Incandescent Blaze Society, some of the most dangerous fanatics in the Imperium.
Nayuri is also Preceptor of the military arm and titular general of the Legion of Red Devastation, with Karin Missum (General of Red Devastation, friend of Prince Miruseya), Huso hiChirengmai (Red Star clan, said to be the head of Incandescent Blaze), and the Vriddi of Fasiltum, it will be difficult to pull together the moderates and fanatics, East and West. Lately, the incursion of hte Legion of Red Devastation into Saa Allaq a bit of tension.
## XL. Temple of Dlamelish
The intrigues of this temple and its Cohort have been hoted as (see Hrihayal). A similar fact regarding Kaikama’s victory has enthused the temple and Ma’in.
## XLI. Ruined Temple of Thumis

## XLII Temple of Qon
As the cohort of Belkhanu this temple shares its interests and duties. Presently many of the priests and magicians are concerned with and at work on the uncertainties and disruptions currently happening in the many planes. Travel in the planes, normally risky is not advised at this time…
## XLIII. Administration Building
(See Governor’s Palace and Palace of the Realm).
# Bey Sy: Areas of Interest

# A. Great Market Plaze of Ashonetl Viridda
Amidst the stalls and stores of the artisan clans, rise impromptu or at least temporarily, often seasonal stalls and sales areas. Trades from the rural environs, other cities, and nations collect and migle here in one of the largest centres of the world. The noise here is also unlike anywhere else for the volume and variation, as each merchant strives to sell their goods. For better, or more expensive, wares, merchants send advertisements (via small children) to clanhouses for “private showings”, but for the most part, anything one desires (legally) can be found in the marketplace. To keep order, Market Police (members of the city militia under the Governor’s command) armed and armored as medium infantry, patrol regularly. They apprehend criminals (thieves), keep the peace, watch for counterfeit coinage and check weights and measures. This last is an interesting occupation for if one complains to a merchant before a deal is complete, the merchant may cancel the deal without harm, but if checked after a deal is done and the scales are wrong, woe to the merchant, if the scales are right, woe to the customer for false charges! Prices for putting up a stall are: a copper Qirgal or 2 per day for a pavement space, a kaitar or 2 to erect an awning and 3-4 kaitar’s per day for one of the stalls under the porticoes at the markets’ side.
## B. Lower Class Residences
Although (as with the slums) artisans may rent a place at the market, they can also sell from this area, their workshops. “Skill knows no clan” it is sometimes said and (although rare) sometimes true. Clans most likely found here are: Plume of White, High Tower, Green Stone, Green Emerald, Green Opal, Flat Peak, and Woven Whip.
## C. Slave Market
Operated and patronized by members of the Collar of Bronze Clan and those who wish to buy/sell slaves (such as foreigners, etc.). This market is open to those of low status who do not mind being seen (or run errands) here. For those of almost any status , showings are arranged with “special” sales advertised by courier (as per the marketplace above). In these semi-private or private auctions, purchasers or their agents peruse the slave standing on lighted podium in a dark room , while using tiny mirrors to signal their “bid”. For who would do else with a slaver.
## D. Walls of Hejjeka V
Despite the fact that this Emperor was not a militarily-inclined man, his “openhandedness” led to much depletion of the Tsolyani treasury and hence to projects such as this well-made wall. With towers, two forts unrivalled in the city (save perhaps by the Tolek Kana Pits, but that was for another purpose… and cunningly laced barbicans, embrasures, etc., still this wall lacks the fame of Patyel’s Wall. (Perhaps because that wall being older before the brunt of the Mu’ugalavyan assault).
## E. Hirilakte Arena
It is customary for those of Noble status to be exempt from the small fee at the arena and this fits the bearing of the contests within this edifice. No spectacle of grisly slaughter of innocents here! Although one will not want for spectacle, great pains are taken to ensure equality in all contest (at least outwardly). A number of professional Gladiators are always a good start to a day at the arena, of course. They may be followed by a duel or two, whether of noble fighters (or their champions, seconds, etc.) or a pair of magicians (with great pains to protect the crowd and ensure a fair fight), the crowd will get a good show. Of course, the arena can be changed (with some work) into a sea battle, a battle of monsters, etc. But all must be fair! As a matter of interest, those people who lose a “duel of honour” are enslaved to the victor (just them… not any possession other than they carried!). And it is expected that they (or their clan, etc.) be “ransomed” back. (Grave consequences and further challenges follow any other or too expensive of course!). Prices for ransom (guidelines) are: Commoners 1-500 K.; lower circle soldier/priest 600-1000 K.; military officer/high circle priest 2000-20,000 K.; aristocrat 5,000-50,000 K.If the “loser” was a “champion” it is just they who are enslaved (and must be bought back as a matter of honour).
## F. Lower-Middle Class Houses
Sometimes both workshop and dwelling, these clanhouses and quarters are home to the following clans: Weeping Stone, Victorious Globe, Standing Pinnacle, Black Hood, Black Mountain, Black Monolith, Blazoned Sail, Broken Reed, Broken Bough, Iron Fist and Iron Hand.
## G. Middle Class Houses
Many of the clansmen in these homes will go elsewhere in the city to work, at Palaces, temples, shops, and marketplaces. The clans most likely found here are: Blue Kirtle, Black Stone, Red Sky, Red Star, Green Kirtle, Golden Dawn, Golden Sphere, Golden Sheaf, Golden Sapphire, Glory of the Worm, Blue Shadow, Blue Stream, Copper Doom, Golden Lintel, Silver Lighting, Silver Collar, Red Flower, and Scroll of Wisdom.
## H. Residences and Palaces of the Lower Upper Class
Many include clanhouses or a rich person’s domain with clanhouse elsewhere. Here are the well-off of the Imperium, many working at occupations in military, priestly, or administrative affairs. Some find themselves well-to-do and do not wish to work. Thus is the prerogative of the rich! Clans based here will include (but individuals may be of any upper clan in the Empire): White Stone, White Crystal, Purple Gem, High Pinnacle, Emerald Girdle, Great Stone, Doomed Tomb, Dark Fear, Dark Water, Dark Moon, Dark Flame, Amber Cloak, Standing Stone, Joyous of Vra, Iron Helm, Staff of Beneficence, Grey Cloak, and Grey Wand.
## I. Residences and Palaces of Upper Class/Nobles
The houses within the walls will tend to be clanhouses while those outside are more likely to be the palatial groups of Nobles - those members of the great clans who have achieved power, status and perhaps even one of the old Bednalljan noble titles. The clans of those folk included: Sea Blue, Golden Sunburst, Vriffi, Golden Bough, Cloak of Azure Gems, Jade Diadem, Blade Raised High, and the royal Tlakotani clan.
## J. Ferry Quays
These wooden and stone constructions are found along the banks of the Missuma wherever the city has not encroached upon the riverside. They represent the only cheap and (relatively) safe way to cross to the City of the Dead and the suburbs of the East bank. Of course one may try to cross by boat, but the river patrols may then require inducements that offset any such economy.
## K. Sakbe Roads
This is where the great continent - spanning road/walls meet, the nexus of the Tsolyani Empire (to a Tsolyani anyway). From here go the great Chlen carts, slave trains, etc., to upkeep armies, repay obligations, maintain trade (and traders), etc. Also to be seen are the great travelling Palanquins of the wealthy and/or powerful, convoys of slaves, bearers, inter-city Palanquins, extra bearer shifts, guards, etc.

With all this travel and the need for order, bureaucratic arrangements, etc., it can be seen that the fortresses nearest Bey Sy are less for military forces (at the center of the Empire) then for policing, guiding, quartering tax collectors, and other officials. Considering the inducements of such places is surely one of the better postings for Sakbe Road guards! The Sabke Roads near Bey Sy as with most of those in the five Empires, predate the founding of this (relatively) modern Tsolyani state self. Built originally by the Bednalljun Dynasty, improved and extended by the later Engsvanyali Imperium, they are repaired and refurbished as the heart of Imperial transportation. Thus what may be the basements of those old towers may be older than one would think!
## L. Berenangalain
Situated somewhat East of the “Breadbasket” of the Empire, nevertheless the farmers and gardeners do make a good living here with such a hungry populace nearby (the majority of Bey Sy foodstuffs is imported by road or water from the “Breadbasket” and elsewhere). This area, as with many important places in the world is more remembered for its role in history than any present gains or losses of a merchant clan. Trod on by the Mu’ugalavyani in 2020 when they besieged Bey Sy, the Berenangalain witnessed the grim fighting on both sides during the Reef of Bey Sy (late 2020). Some of the Legions presently in the city take part in the victory celebrations of this historic event but there are fewer than in the past, and many have forgotten (The Legion of the Mighty Prince is one of the few of those left with head quarters here).
## M. Slums and Lower-class housing
Across all civilizations and throughout history there have always been those whose misfortunate birth in lower clans have them apart from “richer” areas. The Tsolyani customs and needing proper placement have raised this district to its proper place. Here are found those who work at jobs (and other things) that are considered low class. A proper view would be seeing those here as doing an honorable occupation, at least accepting their station. It is here that clanhouses for the following clans/occupations: Women Mat, Red Moon, Scarlet Mantle, Rch of Heaven, Bright Sword, Green Pyramid, Scarlet Planet of Knives, Granite Lintel, Glass Spear, Orifice of Iron, Turning Wheel, Standing Reed, Hand of Companions, Emerald Circlet, etc.
## N. Patyel’s Wall
Famous for its defence of Bey Syduring the Mu’ugalavyani siege of 2020, names of Legions who defended Bey Sy are still remembered by the guards (and others) here. From the Legion of the 12th Imperial Artillery who “Continued to fire from the ramparts...until the Mu’ugalavyani smashed the walls away from under them” to the 19th and 23rd Imperial Archers whose men died heroes in this and other battles of the time. Guards here have a history unlike any other - and it shows in their bearing.
## O. Swamps of the Blessed
These lowlands of bog and fen form a treacherous morass through which paths are often impermanent, hidden, and deadly. Besides the alien plant life, such as Food of the Ssu, there are other traps and beasts which thrive in the watery graves and stinking piles. The presence of the Tolek Kana Pits is blamed for this and the recent increase in deaths nearby may be attributed to the increased activity of Prince Dhech’une, but the truth is only known to those who cannot tell.
## P. Port of Swords (Military Port)
This is the harbour of the military and river patrol. Although the seas are dangerous and trade there is limited, no such restrictions exist on this inland waterway, the Missuma River. Hence, the city receives most of the foodstuffs and goods needed to support millions of citizens as well as the suburbs and numerous legions to the North. To keep this traffic under control and supply fresh recruits, equipment, and other military needs, the presence here of numerous warships and military transports is vital. As well as all of the above, it must be remembered that the ships travelling up and down the river (from Jakalla to Avanthar) must be kept safe from pirates and often convey messages of importance to garrisons along the extent of the river. Finally, there are the Nobles and Important personages who (sometimes with families) travel to various meetings and functions (political, religious, etc.) throughout the year. Warships range from the great Zirunel used to carry princes, etc., to the small Sescha class galley or even to smaller rowboats for customs inspection. Merchant ships are confined to those barges and ships which can be rowed, for how could one use sails exclusively on a river? At times (and recently) there have been a few unusual ships on the river, most usually the smaller variety of Gsa-Hr, a Shen ship out of Salarvya taking advantage of the Salarvyani penchant for revolt to ship much-needed grain from that land directly to Bey Sy. The one in port at present is a 45 meter long bireme with single mast and lateen rigged sail [a triangular sail set on a long yard mounted at an angle on the mast].
## Q. Harbour
The Asometl Port to the North is an exception to the merchandising described above in the military Port of Swords, and which is so necessary to the life of the city. Rather, this port is used for anything from ceremonial activities from the Governor's Palace to supplies for anywhere in the city. The Main wharves of the Harbour of Pa-Satlkolum are where most of the bustle described above occurs. Here await the ever-present gaggle of customs and Tax collectors and it is here that almost all shipping is directed by the ever-alert military boats. Those who try to escape this had better show the Navy some extensive or important documentation, for to do otherwise (or try and evading the dozens of naval vessels) is to risk fines or worse. Customs and tolls that have been paid to the South are supposed to be well-documented and may still be expected to drain off some kaitars in ‘inducements’ before all is settled. For those who have not paid at Jakalla or one of the other Southerly ports, a toll of 1% of the purchase price of the cargo is charged, plus 1-2% expected in ‘gifts’. As above, documentation had better be in order... or it may cost a lot more! Tax offenses are: a lecture for the first evasion, subsequent offenses start fines (75-100% of tax added, imprisonment of up to 1 year, slavery, and impalement.

- Béy Sǘ: On the right bank of Mssúma river there is the vast temple complex of Avánthe, the temple of Keténgku, the mighty complex of Sárku's temple of the Rising from the Tomb, a few other minor temples, the City of the Dead where all the Tlakotáni emperors are laid to rest as well as the graves of many from the Bednálljan dynasty, and lastly the Tólek Kána Pits which is the vast imperial prison complex. Most of the temples, the City of the Dead and the Pits are connected via the “underworld”. Beneath the “underworld” is the “Ultimate Labyrinth” from which none have ever emerged. There is also the “Maze of Unreturning” below the Hall of Mnettukeng which may be part of the “Ultimate Labyrinth”. Before the governor's palace there is an awe-inspiring colossus of Hejjéka IV “Restorer of Dignities.”
- Puru oil: beloved by those in Béy Sǘ, and used for body treatments.
- The Temple of Eternal Knowing, dedicated to Thúmis in Béy Sǘ.
- The value of the gems and golden armor adorning the main statue of Lord Karakán in the Béy Sǘ Temple is estimated at 1 million káitars.
- This temple's Tunkúl gong has a droning boom to it.
- Below the Hall of Mettukeng (across the river from Béy Sǘ between the Tólek Kána Pits and the Temple of Sárku) is the Maze of Unreturning.

In Béy Sü, Lady Avánthe operates schools of literature, the arts, and beauty because this Goddess celebrates beauty in many ways. These schools in Her temples in Béy Sü are exemplary. She is an elegant Goddess and Her sanctuaries and shrines are always gloriously maintained and trimmed. Her Emerald-and-Blue Shrine in Béy Sü is lit with panes of stained glass in the roof so that there is always an interlocking of colored shadows on the floor below. It is a beautiful place, enhanced with floral incense and streams of mist and sparkling lights floating through the air. All other Temples of the Lady strive to match the beauty of this shrine, each in its own manner of grace.

B is for Bey Su, the “uncrowned capital” of Tsolyanu where the bureaucrats and priests do the work of the empire. Where Avanthar is ornate, quiet and orderly, Bey Su is dirty, noisy and crowded with people rushing on all manner of vital errands. To be a policeman in Avanthar, you must be handsome and polite; in Bey Su, you must be clever and quick.

Comment [1]

This is a nice document. I still feel there is so much we don't know about the city. On Phil's hand-drawn map there is an area just northwest of the Palace Pleasure Gardens. I view this area as the center of Tlokiriqaluyal clans; this center curving southwest to the pyramids of Ssirandar III and the Unknown Pyramid. The Unknown Pyramid is secretly the Ebon Pyramid mentioned in the Epic of Hrugga and is a three-sided structure of orbicular diorite. It predates the building of the city and in-fact is the reason the city was built at all. Middle and lower class Tlokiriqaluyal clans stand between the Unknown Pyramid and Patyel's Wall. Just to the south lies the city-bisecting public fora that include palaces, temples, shrines, legion HQs, and the Arena of Tlakotani Glory (biggest arena in the Five Empires). Beyond, to the south, of the Arena-Great Square-Four Palaces axis lie mixed culture slums and lower class residences and the Foreigner's Quarter. Outside Patyel's Walls stand the neighborhoods of the Tlomitlanyal. That majority culture builds its grandest clan palaces around Lake Tsamkolel.

The east bank is the exclusive zone of the Old Gods and their dark shrines and Underworlds.

I believe Phil's picture is artistic license. Actual burial pyramids are found in dozens of Cities of the Dead in the hills and gullies east of Bey Sy. I use the site of St. Louis as my guide. The Mssuma is the Mississippi. The river is over half-a-mile wide. There are hill clusters stretching off into Ohio to the east. It's a good template to use. Even Phil admitted the Mssuma was the Mississippi, mid-westerner that he eventually was. [[#↑]]

### The Observatory of Qiyór
Source: EPT 2nd Edition

This tower stands on the one of the heights of the Berenánga Hills, amid the gorges hosting various tombs of Béy Sý’s Cities of the Dead. Though in ruins, its aspect grants a +2 increase to the failure threshold of Theurgy, Thaumatology or any other skill rolls involving astrology (as limited as astrology is in Tékumel’s starless universe). Continued study over three rises in experience level grants a permanent one-point increase to Psychic Ability; over five, a two-point increase; over six, a three-point increase. The referee must ensure that a thorough studyover time occurs throughout these level rises, in order to qualify for the increases to basic talent.
It was in the observatory that Qiyór operated the Orb of All-Seeing, came into contact with the Visage of Votorkún, and died.
