***A Chákan Dinner Menu***

A meal served in a Pan Chakan clanhouse, out in the countryside in Gishu Prefecture, to mark the formal beginning of autumn on the 18th of Fesru. It's not fancy dinner-party food, but not exactly daily fare either – just a little bit extra. There's a lot of chile in it, to help purge any remaining noxious influences from the inauspicious calendar dates that are just past – the 'Nine Poison Days' and so forth. There's no meat, either, which is partially just a coincidence and partially due to most of the house's kaika having been used for the propitiatory sacrifices recently.  
   
The quantities given here should serve about eight people – give or take, depending on appetites and the amount of snacking beforehand.  
   
   
**ENTREE**

SQUASH BISQUE  
2 lb squash meat (butternut or pumpkin)  
2 lg. onions, chopped  
4 cloves garlic, chopped  
2 Tb butter  
2 tsp paprika or dried ground red chile (more if you want it hotter)  
1-1/2 tsp molasses  
1 tsp ground black pepper  
1 tsp ground allspice  
8 cups stock (pref. chicken)  
2 cups light cream or half-and-half  
1/2 cup dry sherry  
Grated nutmeg

* Saute onion and garlic in butter until transparent and soft.  
* Add squash, stock, chile, pepper, allspice, sugar, and sherry.  
* Bring to boil and cover.  
* Simmer 30 minutes.  
* Puree in blender until smooth.  
* Return puree to pot, add cream, and simmer until heated and blended through.  
* Serve either hot or cold, garnishing with nutmeg.

   
Served in small ceramic footed bowls, ash gray glaze with dark brown rims and speckling.  
   
(This is a pretty typical Chakan soup, and also often made to offer to one's ancestors at their gravesites. Though without the chile in that case; the dead don't like that.)  
   
   
**MAIN COURSE**

Served simultaneously, in large earthenware pots (beans and potatoes) or bamboo trays (bread and plantains), with side dishes served piled up on separate leaves. The only utensils are flat wooden paddles to serve the beans and potatoes; each diner gets a large flat leaf to put their own portions on.

FLATBREAD  
4 cups flour  
2 Tb yeast  
2 Tb oil  
2 tsp salt  
Warm water  
Food coloring: about 6 drops red \+ 1 drop blue for a light reddish *dna*\-like tint

* Dissolve yeast in 1 cup warm water  
* Add flour, salt, oil, coloring, and about 2 cups warm water (as needed).  
* Knead into a smooth dough (about 10-15 minutes); place in greased bowl and allow to rise until doubled in bulk.  
* Punch down and allow to rise again.  
* Meanwhile, heat your griddle to about 250-280C (say 480-530F – hot). If you have a pottery kiln or outdoor oven, use large, clean ceramic tiles.  
* Punch down and then pull into separate pieces (should make about twenty).  
* Form each piece into a cake and press or roll flat until about 12" across.  
* Bake the loaves on the griddle surface; at high enough temperature they should be done in about two minutes. At which point they'll look alarmingly puffy, but they'll collapse as soon as they begin cooling.

   
Alternately: If you don't happen to have a pottery kiln handy and your people don't mind the "fry" in "fry bread"...  
4 cups flour  
2 tsp baking powder  
1 tsp salt  
1-2/3 cup warm water  
Food coloring: as above  
Oil or lard to fill pan to at least 2" deep.

* Mix the flour, baking powder, salt, coloring, and water together and knead until smooth.  
* Roll out dough to about 1/4" thick, then cut out rounds (or other shapes) about 4" across.  
* Fry in hot oil/lard until puffy and brown on both sides.  
* Drain or blot and eat soon.

   
Served on a flat loose-woven bamboo tray with a lid, to keep in the heat a bit.  
   
FRIED PLANTAINS  
3 ripe plantains  
Oil or lard to fill pan to at least 1" deep  
 

* This is pretty basic. Peel the plantains and remove any of the stringy bits, then cut them lengthwise into thin strips.  
* Cook them in the hot oil until they're brown. Don't overcook though; they turn nasty.  
* Drain, blot, sprinkle lightly with salt.

   
Served on the same kind of tray as the bread.  
   
(While this seems the plainest to us, it's actually more of a special dish for the Chakans – plantains don't grow west of the Turin river at all, and they have to be carried on foot and boat up from the southern lowlands. While it's not really felt to be a foreign recipe, the ingredient makes it a bit exotic, perhaps.)  
   
DRUNKEN BEANS  
6 jalapeno chiles, seeded and stemmed, cut in half  
3 cups black beans  
18 oz. beer  
2 med. onions, quartered  
1-1/2 Tb oil  
2 tsp mint leaf, fresh, chopped finely  
9 cups water (approx.)  
 

* In a large pot, combine the beans, beer, water, onion, and oil, and let soak overnight.  
* Bring mixture to boil, reduce heat, add mint leaf, and simmer until beans are done. If it starts to dry out before they're done, add more water.  
* Remove the chiles and onion, and drain excess liquid.

   
Served garnished with mint and cilantro flakes.  
   
(Black beans are a staple of the Pan Chakan diet; red beans are pretty much reserved for ritual meals and fortunetelling. White and other colors and types of beans are only ever used in foreign dishes in Pan Chaka, not good decent home-cooked food. For the record, Pan Chakans never re-fry their bean dishes, unless they're really dirty Urmishites who actually *like* eating stuff that looks like dung...)  
   
TANGERINE POTATOES  
3 lbs potatoes (mixed types: golden, purple, and sweet potato)  
4 cloves garlic, finely chopped  
1 cup tangerine (or orange) juice  
1/4 cup grated tangerine (or orange) peel/zest  
2 Tb tomato paste  
2 Tb crushed dried red chile  
2 Tb peanut oil  
1 Tb ground black pepper  
2 tsp ginger, grated or finely chopped  
2 tsp sugar  
1 tsp vinegar (white or rice wine)  
1 small anchovy (or equivalent dollop of anchovy paste)  
 

* Peel and cut the potatoes into large chunks; boil until done. Drain and set aside.  
* Heat the oil in a pan, then add the chile, pepper, ginger, garlic, and anchovy and stir-fry it about 30 seconds.  
* Add the juice, catsup, sugar, and peel and cook for another \~15 seconds (briefly, anyway – just enough to get it hot and mixed). If it's not thick enough, add a little cornstarch-water mixture or other thickener.  
* Add the potato chunks and the vinegar and stir until coated and heated.

   
Served garnished with toasted pine nuts and borage flowers.  
   
(A pretty classic Pan Chakan flavor palette, with citrus and ginger. Dried fish from the coast of Tsechelnu, obtained through traders, are used to provide saltiness and a bit of tangy flavor to a lot of Pan Chakan recipes, though for religious purposes some households or individuals can't eat fish and sea creatures, and use plain salt instead. In some parts of Tsolyanu borage flowers are considered unlucky and thought to attract Avanthe's Curse – blue eyes – but the Chakans, among others, think that's hogwash and like them for their cucumbery flavor and small starlike shape.)  
   
SIDE DISHES & CONDIMENTS  
Tomato wedges  
Cucumber spears  
Pineapple balls  
Pickled white button mushrooms  
Dried cranberries  
Hard-boiled egg slices  
   
Each served piled up on a smaller leaf. The other garnishes mentioned above were also put out for people to add more of as they liked, along with some ground sea salt and toasted sesame seeds.  
   
   
**DESSERT**

Two were available – one involving the mysterious and frankly suspect phenomenon of sub-zero temperatures, one more mundane and less toxically exotic.  
   
MELON SHERBET  
1 mid-to-large honeydew melon  
2 lemons  
5 Tb sugar  
1 egg white, beaten into soft peaky stage  
3 Tb dark rum  
1 Tb Southern Comfort

* Cut up the melon, removing the rind.  
* Grate rind of one lemon and juice both, add rind and juice to melon chunks.  
* Add sugar and stir gently until sugar dissolves  
* Puree mixture in blender.  
* Fold in beaten egg white. Add liqueur.  
* Put mixture into chilled ice cream maker or dasher; turning it continuously allow the mixture to turn mushy.  
* Pour into a mold and freeze until firm.

   
This was served with little disposable scoops made out of a bamboo segment – simply cut into slightly concave strips about 4" long and 3/4" across. They're a little thicker than we'd be used to for spoons, but fine for eating soft foods with.  
   
NUTTY HOT FIG TART  
Crust:  
2 cups flour  
1/2 cup sugar  
1 tsp salt  
1/2 lb unsalted butter (cold, diced)  
Cold water  
   
Filling:  
4 dried chiles (chipotle or ancho)  
2-1/2 cups dried figs, stemmed and coarsely chopped  
1 cup pecans and/or walnuts, coarsely chopped  
2 cups dry sherry  
3/4 cups brown sugar  
1/4 cup tequila  
1/4 cup unsalted butter  
1-1/2 Tb vanilla extract  
 

* To make the shell:  
* Mix the flour, sugar, and salt in a bowl.  
* Add butter and, with fingers, combine with the dry ingredients until it's in a coarse mealy texture.  
* Add water a tablespoon at a time until it forms a piecrust-type dough.  
* Roll into a ball, wrap up and refrigerate for at least a couple hours.  
* Take out the dough and press it down into a 10" tart pan or equivalent. Even bottom layer, up the sides, and a 1/2" or so ridge above the top edge.  
* Cover with foil or parchment, fill with weights, bake for 20 minutes at 375F.  
* Remove the weights and foil, re-cover only the edges with foil, bake again for another 10 minutes or until the crust is just barely turning light brown.  
* Remove from oven and let cool before filling.  
* To make the filling:  
* Pour boiling water over the chile and soak until tender (a few hours); then de-stem, remove seeds to whatever degree of hotness is desired, and chop up finely.  
* In heavy-bottomed pan, combine the figs, wine, and sugar and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce to moderate heat and cook for 10-15 minutes (until figs are soft and liquid is syrupy).  
* Add butter, tequila, vanilla, nuts, and chile; mix well under medium heat until butter is melted.  
* Remove from heat and cool.  
* Fill shell with it, let it set a bit and cool to room/refrigerator temperature, then serve.

   
(Another foreign recipe in the Chakas, definitely here as a treat for a special occasion. Pecans, at least, grow in the Chakas, but are really not used in native cooking and are basically a wild, 'gathered' food. Walnuts are definitely foreign in the south and have to be got from traders, often from Do Chaka or even Pijena. This is originally a Mu'ugalavyani recipe; the Chakans add a lot more vanilla than in the original.)

**The extrafictional story:**  
We did this yesterday; it was interesting. I was thinking to try a whole roast kaika, with the original 1970s number of drumsticks, certainly; but that got shot down because of the large number of vegetarians involved. In fact, the house it was being held at belonged to vegetarians, and it was their backyard oven/grill pit we were using. In fact, yes, everything listed above was all cooked on a charcoal fire, except the tart. (In fact, what are vegetarians doing with that much grilling paraphernalia in their back yard?) Anyway, this meant the menu got rather constricted in the end, since the cook(s) didn't have time to come up with parallel menu options. So instead of a high-end dinner party/feast day sort of meal, it was more sort of 'a nice dinner in the clanhouse' kind of affair.  
   
The exact calendrical equivalent of the day was hotly disputed by two others in the group \-- what day was it on Tekumel that we were observing? Was it the 20th day of the 8th Tsolyani month, or should you count days from the summer solstice to find out? Frankly I don't much care, but it's something to consider in the future, maybe.  
   
The soup bowls were rice bowls, and the serving scoops were just cheap wooden rice paddles from the same Japanese five-and-dime store. The larger serving pots were a pair of pseudo-Mexican/Southwestern folk-artsy kind of things and probably not meant to hold anything besides fruit; probably plastic fruit. The idea was to use banana leaves as dishes, but they were hard to come by on short notice up here, so we had to improvise. I'm not sure what kind of leaf it was in the end, but someone's girlfriend is missing her exotic tropical houseplant now. The bamboo spoons for the sherbet were made on the spot from a big piece of dead bamboo being ornamental in a patio pot. People arrived at different times, so some got the soup hot and some cold; cold seemed to be preferred in this weather (summery). We also ended up making some both kinds of bread, since we ran out of hot tiles and couldn't get more in time \-- logistical problems with all the Vimuhlan apparatus in the back yard. Re-using the oil from the plantains gives it an interesting flavor \-- not necessarily bad, but not really intentional either.  
   
Beverages went totally off the Tsolyani track, partially due to oversight and partially due to several people really not liking raw dairy products. Cheap domestic beer was about as close as it got to anything the Tsolyani drink, I think.  
   
Apologies to un-American(tm) readers for use of US measurements. 1 teaspoons \= 5 ml, 1 tablespoon \= 15 ml, 1 cup \= 240 ml (IIRC). I think ingredients should be clear.... Southern Comfort is the brand name of a hideously sweet peach liqueur with bubblegum overtones. In the name of all that is good and pure and true, I urge others to use any different kind of fruit liqueur instead. The tangerine meat got eaten by passersby instead of juiced, so while the rind went into the potato dish, bottled orange juice was used instead. Attempts to come up with something besides boring old chicken eggs fell flat (due to lack of time), and trying to dye them green didn't work very well either.  
   
I'd probably change some ingredients or proportions next time around, but it basically seemed to work all right. But next time, dead animals are definitely getting consumed....
