***Whispers from the Tomb***

(oh, come off it. It’s just ***What the Priest of Kuraju Told Me***)

•    **Where did the world come from?**  
It was built by the dead of the last world. They used their minds for shaping it and their bodies for material. Different parts of the world struggled with each other; first the Darkness was injured, which wasn’t good but didn’t ruin things. Then the Egg of the World was broken. That made an ending for the world; Time pushed it away. We live in between. Slowly it fills up, slowly it falls apart; faster and faster it moves.  
	Kuraju was one of the first powers, maybe the first to have a mind; he remembered how things were before the Egg broke, before Time, and before the Sun too, and remembered all the things from the original Darkness. When the Sun appeared, though, it burned his heads and he forgot a lot. He watches and waits now to relearn all the things that are necessary for the Ending. Many other beings and powers understood the wisdom in this and began to follow him; he leads them all. He protects us and will help us.  
   
•    **Where did I come from?**  
You were born when your parents mated, of course. Their bodies combined to make an egg for your body; their minds combined to make a seed for your mind. It hatched, it sprouted; a heart grew and made you move; you lived. When you opened your eyes a wandering soul flew into them and began to dwell inside you. Then the world gave you a name, the Darkness made you a shadow, the Sun filled your heart.  
   
•	**Why am I here?**  
You’re here because you’re part of the world, that’s why. What did you think? If you mean, “what should I do here?”, then the answer is, help Lord Kuraju. That means, lead a good life for the usual and normal span of life, live it just like we should always have lived and as though there was nothing broken in the heavens, make sure your soul gets to the correct afterlife when you die, and then wait, keeping an eye on things, until the end of the world \-- when you have a job to do.  
   
**•	Why do we die?**  
It used to be that people lived up in the Third Sky. When a person’s body on Earth was used up by his heart, it would grow light and float up there, and be renewed. Then when a person up there died his body grew heavy and sank down here for another lifetime. They were just like us, up there; it was no different. At night you could see them in the sky, like bright dust.    
	After the Egg of the World was destroyed, something happened to the Third Sky. Some say there was a war up there; some say the floor broke; some say the Hungry Goddess did it; something changed. But all the people up there are gone. They all fell down through the other heavens and hit the earth. They all died and did not know where to go; there was no place to go. Darkness came in to fill up the holes and keep the Skies from falling down after them. There was no longer any place for the earth-people to go, either.  
	Souls are the ghosts of those sky-people that fell to earth. They are neither matter nor mind; they cannot die; they weary the world. They put holes in it, they drain it. They make time run; they started the end of the world. They get into things and think they are alive. Just as the heart exhausts the body, the soul wears down the mind.  
	Nowadays there’s no place for matter and mind go after they’re done; they have to stay in the world.  
   
**•	What happens after we die?**  
When a living being dies, its soul flies away out of the world. This disrupts the natural friendship between the mind and the body, so each withers away to nothing, alone and isolated. They become nothing, inert, dull stuff.  
	You have received the sacrament of Lord Kuraju; he has made for you one of his Tendrils, so you will be preserved. Your mind and body will stay together after you die, forever, as was always meant to be the way of things. You will go to live in the other city across the river, together with your other family members who have already died. Sometimes your living relatives and your descendants will come visit, too. You will observe the world forever, until the end of time, learning and listening. As your mind expands and understands more, so your body diffuses. Little particles of you might travel to the far ends of the world and back, and you’ll be aware of everything going on around you.  
	Your soul, meanwhile, will travel outside this world and go down through the underworlds until it reaches the Quiet Place, the Safe Home. Lord Kuraju, his Cohort Lord Dormu, and their kings and ministers live there. Dijatl the Copper-Clawed sits as judge over newly-arrived souls, Ku’un the Corpse-lord speaks for them; they will examine your soul and assign it a place, and there it will be protected until the end of the world. It will not cause problems there.  
	This is the way Lord Kuraju figured out the world could go on, after the disasters of the Sun and the Egg, and still end properly. It should, he thinks, work out right if we do it this way. Once everything has decayed entirely it can be set going again the way it should have always been.  
   
**•	How do I do magic?**  
Magic is simply knowing secret ways of acting on the natural properties of the world. Most of the forces of the universe were created in the Darkness, before the Sun was made, and many were hidden or fled from it when it appeared. That’s why the Dark Powers have so many secrets, and know more than the Light Powers. We know, through Lord Kuraju, that eyes aren’t needed for sight and illumination isn’t necessary for knowledge. He brings us, in time, into all secrets.  
	Sorcerers who reject the Darkness are impatient and frightened, and do “magic” by tearing holes in the world and taking from other universes. This is wrongdoing. Just as souls are parts of this world that escape to others and drain our world, so bringing alien forces into this one is improper. It may change how the universe decays, interfering with the right way of things. Lord Kuraju knows this, and that’s why proper sorcerers should be holy men and women, so they can receive the wisdom of the Great Worm and not do wrong. Those who steal their power from alien realms are both dangerous and wicked.  
	That said, there are some few sorceries that rightly and properly deal with these outside energies and forces. They should be used only by the wisest and most blessed of the people of the Darkness.  
   
**•	I have heard of other spirits and powers. Can you tell me the truth about them?**  
Darkness?  
Darkness is the first state of the world; it is the natural state of the universe. It moves, it holds, it turns. It is never empty but always hungry; it never grows but always changes; it is restful but it never sleeps. It gave rise to the Sun; it is everything that was not destroyed or marred by light. The Sun grows brighter as the universe decays; Darkness is reduced to shadows, though sharper and sharper the shadows become. By the Ending, they will have a cutting edge.  
Fate?  
An illusion caused by souls infecting our minds; a lie told by the gods of Stability. Nothing was fixed and certain even when the world was new-made; how much less so once Time appeared? Even decay is not inexorable and inevitable; it’s only a very good likelihood. Lord Kuraju does not deal in certainties, only in probabilities. He is among the eldest powers and the wisest, however, and as the gamblers say, a god’s guess is gold. He may reveal his guesses about the future to his followers, at times; the profane call this “prophecy”. Divination, such as the village witches and bazaar wizards do, is foolishness at best. Trying to pry into the future and insist it happen a particular way is impious. You can make your best estimate if you like, put a wager on it if you want, too; but for you, blessed of Lord Kuraju, what’s the worry? Relax. It’s not like you’re going to miss anything; you’ll be here for it.  
The Earth?  
The Earth is the Great Worm, the Old Body of Lord Kuraju. His tail is in the east, his head is in the west; the oceans surround and pool up to the north and the south. He arches over the underworlds, he curls beneath the skies. He has many layers of skin: rocks, clay, sand, soil, gravel, mud, loam; he makes a home for living things on top of it.  
The Forests?  
They were made by Ksoru, out of his mind. They are the original gardens, before the Sun came. They are the refuge of the old darkness upon the face of the earth. But not our darkness, the darkness of Lord Kuraju.  
Mountains?  
The small ones are just ridges and ripples in the skin of the Earth Worm; the great mountain ranges are where the rings of his segments meet.  
Volcanoes?  
Eruptions in the Earth Worm’s body caused by the god Vomehla and his fires. Where the light hits sensitive bits, the skin gets inflamed. They’re only the Earth Worm’s pimples, but very dangerous for little people like us who get too close to them at the wrong time.  
Earthquakes?  
Tremors are shudders of the flesh of the Old Body; great upheavals are when he thrashes about. By sincere prayer and humble beseeching we can soothe him, though most people pray to the god Chedan to intercede for us, who live on the back of the Great Worm.  
The Ocean?  
Just water that falls onto the Earth and rolls off. They become salty because they mix with the Earth Worm’s sweat.  
The Sun?  
That’s the god Vomehla’s body. It came after the Darkness and made it imperfect, but Lord Kuraju had guessed it was coming and things seem to be working out all right. It warms the Earth and invigorates living things; it’s what hearts are made of. It travels through the Fourth Sky; the Earth Worm eats it at night and shits it out at dawn. That way it doesn’t slide below the earth and light up the underworlds; the Darkness is safe there.  
The Winds?  
A Power of Hrehri, pushing all things forward. It sweeps clean the roads of the planets; it brings the rainclouds from where they are made. Just as the Flame of Vomehla invigorates living beings, the Wind of Hrehri motivates the material of the world. It brings movement and transformation; it is the spirit of change itself.  
The Rains?  
Gifts of the goddess E’eth, the Foodbringer. Far off in the edges of the world, where the First Sky rises out of the Ocean, there are sheer mountains riddled with caves, and there she oversees her minions, who brew the rains in great vats. They throw them out of the caves and down the cliffs from the First Sky, and the Winds catch them and blow them down towards the center of the world.    
The Planets?  
The three planets are the visible bodies of gods; they live in the Eighth Sky. Ületl is the Chrysalis of Lord Kuraju; he will hatch his new body from it later, and for now it stays close to the Sun for warmth, and because it is shy and tender. Riruchel is the body of Kerkan, the god of armies and empires. Shichel is the body of Owüne, the goddess of growing things and life. Other gods dwell there too, but do not have bodies that can be seen by our eyes. Ziruna is not a planet like the others; it is the seating-mat of Hrehri within the Seventh Sky, Windhome.  
The Moons?  
The small slow moon, Gayel, is the greenish home of Dlomela, the goddess of pleasure and joy. The big fast moon, Kashi, is the reddish home of Chedan, the god of volcanoes, the city, of propitiating the Sun. Both lie in the Fifth Sky.  
Spirits?  
Some souls get into living creatures when they’re born, but not all do. Some take up residence in unliving things, like rocks and trees and rivers and roads. Some don’t have material bodies at all, but get hearts, or shadows, or even minds, from different places and in different ways. Some just float around as pure spirits; they’re everywhere, but this kind is hard to interact with – there’s nothing to them but spirit\! How can you summarize them all? They’re here because the universe is broken, and their being here hurts it, but it’s not their fault. Be wary of them, and seek out the priests of Lord Kuraju to handle them.  
Undead?  
Matter and mind bound together by the Tendril after the course of a life, that’s all. Sometimes a person stays active after they die and the soul has gone to the underworld. That should happen only if Lord Kuraju wills it, or his priests do, to help with some task. Sometimes a person is so busy with living they forget to stop when they die; the priests of Lord Kuraju and Lord Dormu can help sort them out. Often it’s because their soul got at their mind and messed it up really badly during life; usually in a case like that, once the soul is gone they can be put in a monastery to pray and mediate until their heads are straightened out. There’s nothing magical about this at all; it’s just how the people of Lord Kuraju are.  
	But wicked sorcerers can make the same thing happen, or something very much like it, for their own petty and unholy ends. Usually it damages the mind when they do it, without the Tendril; that allows them to control the dead person and bend them to their sick and twisted will. Lord Kuraju’s blessing protects you from having this happen to you, but the profane are easy victims of such necromancy.  
	Sometimes the soul gets back into the body; that’s very, very wrong, indeed. Oh, the horror\! Strong and blessed priests of Lords Kuraju and Dormu must catch such an abomination and destroy it.  
Demons?  
That’s what we earth-people call beings or people from outside – from one of the Skies, or one of the Underworlds. There’s more different kinds of demon than there are raindrops in the monsoon, they say. Some are small and weak, like our animals; some are mighty and powerful, like great heroes or little gods. Some are fellow followers of Lord Kuraju; our friends. The others are best avoided.  
Pariah Gods?  
No one knows for sure what they are, only what they do. They’re like gods, but they want to make the world vanish, not exist at all, for nothing to exist, not even the Darkness. All the other powers and gods can agree on one thing, at least: the Pariahs are enemies. But people still worship them, because they offer great wealth, and power, and pleasure to their servants, and they don’t mean to erase the world until near the very Ending anyway. For the short-sighted, for those who think that they are their souls, for those who plan to flee from the world anyway, it’s easier to not hate the Pariahs. We, the people of Lord Kuraju, know that they must be taken much more seriously.  
   
**I have heard of other peoples and beings who are not like us. Can you tell me the truth about them?**  
Pachi Lei?  
Non-human people who live in the jungles and mountains of southern Pan Chaka. Some live in Butrus, too. They are shaped like eggs, with flesh like toads, but have six limbs and live in trees, like monkeys. There are no Pachi Lei men, only women. They are people of the Darkness like us, but most pay reverence to Hrehri or Ksoru, not Lord Kuraju. The Mu’ugalavyani hate them, and they hate the Mu’ugalavyani.  
Pe Choi?  
Another non-human forest-dwelling, people who live Do Chaka to the north of here. They are hard-shelled, like insects, but have two legs and two arms like us. Their men are black and their women are white. Some chose to follow Lord Kuraju long ago, but most turned to the worship of the human gods of Stability.  
Hlaka?  
A kind of non-human people who fly in the First Sky on wings. They are like magpie-people and like bat-people; they have three eyes. Timid and noisy, they go where they want but keep to themselves; they fear the sea and ignore the gods.  
Cannibals?  
By “cannibalism” I assume you mean “salvage”. When a profane person dies his mind begins to dissipate; it drifts near the body for a while, growing sluggish and dull, and then fades away altogether. It is lost.  
 	By properly eating a person’s body, one of Lord Kuraju’s initiates can rescue this mind. It becomes part of the initiate; it does not make the bond between the dead person’s flesh and mind lasting, like the Tendril does. Sometimes, they say, the dead mind joins that of the salvager, he gains the knowledge and thoughts of the dead person. Usually, though, the mind is simply kept from oblivion; it stays in the world and isn’t lost. It can be kept in the Darkness and might be useful later. You must never, ever salvage a fellow worshipper of Lord Kuraju; it is a terrible sin, and it will also destroy you in horrible ways. You will go insane; people will think you are possessed by a spirit, but nothing will drive it out; your own flesh will be filled with hate against itself and become monstrous.  
	There are other ways to eat a person, too, of course. There are those who worship the Flame who eat people, but they consume the heart, not the mind; they add it to their own, and it gives them strength, courage, vitality. Some wicked people have heard of these two different things but don’t understand them; they are full of greed and fear and devour other people any-which-way, without the direction of the gods, seeking power and life. They do become powerful and ever-living, unable to die as long as they continue eating; they are dangerous, treacherous, clever, alone.  
   
**Who is Kuraju**?  
Kuraju is the god that the Tsolyani call Sarku. The peoples of the Chakas have worshipped him all along; the Ito kings were his vassals. Once upon a time he was married to Mother Quyo, who lives across the western sea, but now they are divorced and he lives in the Place of the Dead, beneath Pan Chaka.  
	There are many other people who follow him in Tsolyanu.  
   
**Who Are the Other Great Spirits of Butrus**?  
•    Hnalla and Traru  
•    Kerkan and Chekarru  
•    Ksoru and Kegün  
Ksoru is a god of impatient intellect and selfish curiosity, the greedy desire to pry out secrets for one’s personal pleasure and power. Long ago Ksoru rebelled against the gods and they imprisoned him in the Blue Room, where he sleeps, dreaming until the end of time. In the meanwhile his Cohort sly Kegün prowls the world, seeking his freedom. While Ksoru sleeps, we wait in wakefulness, waiting for mysteries to reveal themselves that Ksoru’s mind digs and grubs to discover. He is as impatient as Lord Kuraju is patient.  
•    Hrehri and Erü  
Hrehri is the great Darkness, its manifestation in divine form. He is entropy, chaos, cold, darkness, and mystery. His Cohort is the whimsical and confusing Erü.

Incomplete \-- never finished off. Lummra gethakh\!  This was, obviously, inspired by the “What My Father/etc. Told Me” articles that people have written up in huge quantity for the Glorantha setting; I’ve always wished there were some for \[canon\] Tekumel. I’d like to do more of these myself, but... someday.
