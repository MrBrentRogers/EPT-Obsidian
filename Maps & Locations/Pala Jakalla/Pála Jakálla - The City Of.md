The City of Pála Jakálla

Pála Jakálla had a population of some 45,000 at last census (in 2350 AS); its name means “Yesterday Jakalla”, and is probably the original site of Jakalla up to the collapse of the Three States of the Triangle. Ideally situated as a staging post for goods coming from the centre of the empire down the Missuma River. Pala Jakalla is located roughly one day’s travel north of Jakalla.

The capital city of Jakásha Province, Pála Jakálla is situated on the headland between the estuaries of the Missúma and Ranánga rivers. The walls encompass eight hills that rise above the low country of the Flats of Tsechélnu, with the necropolis built on a ninth.

Some say that this was the original site of the great metropolis of Jakálla - hence the name, which means “Yesterday” Jakálla. The noted scholar Nyélme hiSurúkhoi asserts that in the course of several Ditlána the site of the city has gradually shifted. However, a shift of forty tsán across a major river is somewhat hard to credit. More credible is the theory that this was the original Jakálla of very ancient times, a title usurped for the current site after the collapse of the Three States of the Triangle.

The mouth of the Missúma River is ideal as a staging post for goods coming down from the interior of the empire. Positioned as it is, the city receives a large proportion of the goods shipped from the hinterland for transportation along the coast or export overseas. Since the river is the easiest method of transporting goods to the capital, the markets of Pála Jakálla are well stocked with exotic goods of all sorts.

## Vade mecum

Several noble clans have houses here. Alongside those usually to be found in the south there are houses of the Íto and the Blade Raised High Clans.

Most houses of the noble clans are clustered around the hill on the top of which is the clanhouse of Cloak of Azure Gems. Many private mansions and palaces, as well as some of the smaller upper-class clanhouses, are situated on the hill where the Tower of Tanmrúktu stands. The area by the city wall between the Gate of Supernal Wisdom and the Gate of Bushétra contains most of the other high clanhouses such as Grey Cloak and Red Sword. The upper-middle class district comprises the area around the Hirilákte. The buildings between the Governor’s Palace and the Market Square are mostly artisans’ clanhouses, particularly those associated with the finer arts and crafts. The area between the temples and the Missúma holds the lower-class clanhouses, along with some small and rather shabby private residences. The very low-class district lies along the walls next to the Fish Market.

Within the Foreigners’ Quarter, the various nationalities and nonhuman species congregate together in their own little enclaves. Páchi Léi, Swamp Folk, Ahoggyá and Shén are all to be found here (though not in great numbers). There are people from virtually any place in the known world that has a coastline - even the occasional barbarian from as far away as the Nyémes el Isles.

The area surrounding the city is flat and very fertile, benefitting from the fertile silt laid down by both rivers. There are extensive rice paddies, of course, as well as a few specialist crops that are grown almost exclusively in this region.

Away from the city walls the rural population is fairly dense at some seventy people per square kilometre, with towns and villages scattered about the area. Because of the nature of the crops, the peasants here tend to be somewhat better off than their cousins elsewhere in the Empire.

## Clans of Pála Jakálla

There are many clans represented in Pala Jakalla. Some of the more important ones include the Scroll of Wisdom Clan, worshippers of Thumis; the Green Kirtle Clan, which reveres Hrihayal (and her priestesses at the House of the Pleasant Hour…); the Silver Lightning Clan, worshipping Karakan; and the Golden Dawn Clan, which reveres Karakan. Recently, the 15th Imperial Heavy Infantry, the Legion of the Ruby Hand, has just arrived in Pala Jakalla. As these are also worshippers of Karakan, this will doubtless sway the relative importance of these religions within the city.

## Notable Personalities

**Pachú (Lord) Jedusáne Tlakotáni** (age 45; status 220; area 15) The great-great-grandson of the 56th Emperor by a series of younger sons. He is an affable man who spends his time studying the history of the Imperium and dallying with his concubines. His income derives from large estates near Jakálla. Recent events have made Jedusáne a rallying standard for various discontented factions, since he is potentially a candidate for a future Kolumejálim (literally “Emperor-choosing”) if the Emperor were to die childless (in which case all Tlakotáni have the right to compete except for previous princes who have already renounced the Gold.)

**Jaithulénkoi (provincial governor) Bedrántu hiSegutháne** (age 67, status 250; area 34) Governor of Pála Jakálla. A traditionalist, elder of the Clan of Sea Blue, shrewd politician and stalwart member of the Royalist faction. This posting is effectively a retirement sinecure for him after a distinguished diplomatic career. He rules the city with a rod of iron, dealing harshly with any who disturb its harmony.

**Ileosa Arabasti hiSegutháne** of Sea Blue.(age 35; status 215; area 34) Wife of **Bedrántu hiSegutháne**.

**Molkáe (Major) Taimoshétl hiSukándar** (age 52, status 98; area 31) Local commandant of the Omnipotent Azure Legion. He is a former soldier who served in the Legion of Ever-Present Glory under General Kéttukal. He treats this appointment extremely seriously, as it is the first time he has held political office. He is a member of the Red Sword clan (in which the Sukándar family is strongly represented) although originally of the Red Star clan.

**Majjáq Skendrúzhzha** (age 35, status 115) An extremely fat Salarvyáni merchant who is the head of the “guild” of foreign merchants in the Foreigners’ Quarter. He made his fortune in the shipping of rare woods and spices. He is the most influential foreigner in the city and is invited to all the smart social functions. He has committed a good deal of his wealth towards the maintenance of the Imperial Fleet in Pála Jakálla and to various civic works.

**Dlantü (Clan Chief) Bénshatun hiZhámek** (age 28, status 96) The local Dlantü of the Clan of the Moon of Evening. He is extremely youthful for a Clan Chief, a situation which has come about because of the death in an epidemic of all the senior members of his lineage. He keeps a very high profile, hosting regular feasts to celebrate one event or another. These are regularly attended by most of the influential members of the upper-middle class.

**Mayaharétokoi (District Chief) Donmikáyel hiGángasa** (age 25, status 126; area 41) Eldest son of the Chief of the Clan of the Might of Gánga in Pétris Layóda. He is currently District Commandant of the Temple of Hnálla in Pála Jakálla. He lives in a small mansion close to the Tower of Tanmrúktu with his two wives and two children. A poet of mediocre talent, he owns an extensive library of original editions of some of the standard works.

**Tanmrúktu the Skywatcher** (age unknown; status unclear; area 30) A foreigner who has been around for so long that nobody can remember where he came from originally. He lives in a high tower atop the highest of the city’s hills. Candles can be seen burning in the windows of the tower long into the night. He is one of the most respected astrologers in the empire. Although he can only rarely be prevailed upon to cast horoscopes, he does produce charts for important occasions such as the birth of Imperial heirs. His methods of casting are somewhat different from the standard Engsvanyáli routines, but he seems to come up with similar results.

**Kornámu hiVitéshmai** (age 26, status 12) A minor scion of the Golden Sunburst Clan who is employed as bodyguard by Lord Jedusáne Tlakotáni. He is an exponent of the hlèpurdál (two weapon) school of fighting, using not Arruché but a style he developed himself.

**Dlantü (Clan Chief) Parshurái hiQolyélmu** (age 50, status 126) The local Chief of the Clan of the Blade Raised High. Rather plump, he looks young for his age and has many friends among the priestesses of Dlamélish and Hrihayal..

**Dlantü (Clan Chief) Dáusek hiParúdar** (age 60, status 126) The Chief of the Jade Diadem clan. He is a worshipper of Dlamélish and a renowned sorcerer. He is always accompanied by two exquisitely beautiful female slaves who wear torcs, not of the customary bronze, but of steel.

**Paránda hiSsanyúsa** (age 34, status 22) This redoubtable woman married into the Clan of the Cloak of Azure Gems. When her husband died she took Aridáni status and now involves herself in clan business. She is a worshipper of Avánthe and spent four years in the Legion of Lady Mrssa.

**Korazánu hiVrìddi** (age 30, status 25) A well known local duellist who has a reputation for issuing challenges to opponents who have virtually no chance of winning. He is overbearingly arrogant (like most Vrìddi) and gives the impression of extreme ruthlessness. When he chooses, however, he can seem as charming as Lord Ksárul himself.

**Fasharángga the Neck-Breaker** (age 22, status 14) Nobody is quite sure of the origins or nationality of this gladiator. He was trained at the school of Panú’ish Ketlán, and is now under the patronage of the Clan of the Might of Gánga. He is famed for his utter savagery in combat; in one bout he almost tore his opponent’s head from his shoulders. He has been to Jakálla and Béy Sü for bouts. He is immensely powerfully built, and by no means as stupid as his demeanour might suggest.

**Glorio hiArkonas** (age 47; status ; area 1) clan elder of Sea Blue. Shoulder-length black hair, trimmed goatee and mustache.Has a secret identity as Bahor.

**Meliya hiArkonas** (age ; status ; area 1) of Sea Blue .Sister of Glorio hiArkonas. Has a secret identity as Vimanda.

**Graú hiSoldado** (age ; status ; area ) of Red Star (Medium) Tirrikamu (seargent) of Palá Jakálla’s Guards.

MAJOR SOCIETIES: None.

### Karakán

MEMBERS: 68

CHIEF PRIEST: **Kurrishmoi hiPejikhel**, 58, Aridani of Blade Raised High. She rose to her current lofty position by a successful diplomatic carreer in the Palace of War. She is regarded as diplomatic and able.

CHIEF SORCERER: **Hirjan hiFashulara** the 46 year old chief of Fist of Iron is 17th circle. He teaches children of noble clans but is rumoured to be a little greedy. He is also a very capable warrior and was a champion athlete before he 'settled down to a bit of mind bending'. He strongly encourages magic and the temple can find a good range of T spells.

WEALTH: K180,000 in ready assets, more in armour and arms.

MAJOR SOCIETIES: **Rent Curtain**. These anti-Ksarul fanatics are frequently in trouble for their activities elsewhere in the Empire. There could be one or two of them in the city.

**Glorious in Scarlet**, Imperialists and politickers. Kurrishmoi and 39 others are avowed members

**Crimson Brothers** have few members, they seek to propagate the (nearly heretical) view that Karakan and Vimuhla have a closer relationship than current theology admits. This is a violent belief, which leads its followers into wild excursions in search of any scrap of proof that they are right. Ancient tombs and old texts are a favourite target.

### Chegárra

MEMBERS: 35

CHIEF PRIEST: **Chaihellu hiSsanmirin**, 49, of Sea Blue. Was an active supporter of the Eselne, he narrowly avoided impalement after the Rectification of the Emperors. A 'bluff, honest soldier', his own description, he is famed for the number of shamtla cases he has had raised against him. Since the Rectification of the Emperors he has conceived of a hatred of sorcery, and of **Kashu hVorodu**.

CHIEF SORCERER: Vacant, and has been for two years. Applicants should be prepared for disappointment. The previous incumbent took his skills to Jaikalor, along with almost every talented mage over 11th circle, following an ill-fated

trip into the small underworld beneath the town.

WEALTH: Only K25,000 declared on the last tax round. the temple is believed to owe large sums to the temple of Karakan.

MAJOR SOCIETIES: **Glorious in Scarlet**, 21 members

**Ruby Hawk**, a group of orators and publicists, have 4 people active in the area, they recount tales of glorious battles and assist in recruitment for Legions, thereby squeaking past the laws on proselytising.

### Thúmis

MEMBERS: 35

CHIEF PRIEST: **Herenru hiMriku**, of Sea Blue. A dynamic 38 year old who is rumoured to be a powerful sorcerer as well as a capable scholar.

CHIEF SORCERER: Surprisingly the local temple lacks any declared ability to perform T level healing or alleviation, only G level known. They can repair Eyes and have a text on the subject. They buy any damaged items.

WEALTH: They have recently spent large sums on new inner temples and repairs to their estates. Despite donations from influential foreigners they have only K15,000 in cash now.

MAJOR SOCIETIES:

### Keténku

MEMBERS: 25

CHIEF PRIEST: **Haija hiBaruni**, a 59 year old, not dynamic, but an excellent manager of people and money

CHIEF SORCERER: Vacant. Spells up to T5 are available, they certainly have some knowledge spells above this.

WEALTH: K100,000 and substantial property interests.

### Avánthe

MEMBERS: 61

CHIEF PRIESTESS: **Berushme hiBedlenta**, an Aridani of Golden Bough. She is 58 and a traditionalist who supports the Imperial party. She recently won a case against **Chaihellu hiSsanmirin**, who suggested she was bisexual. (she is a declared lesbian).

CHIEF SORCERER: **Arkin hiSengele**, 44, of Blue Sun. He is 16th circle. His taste in women is expensive beyond his ability to manage his forest estates. He is rumoured to be heavily into debt and to be seeking buyers for certain hunting areas.

There are few good sorcerers, most people travel to Jakalla to obtain anything above T5 Healing..

WEALTH: K150,000 plus considerable estates of farms on the flood-plain.

MAJOR SOCIETIES: **Sapphire Bough**, blessers of crops. 27 members of this popular group, mostly low level sorcerers.

**Wellspring of Life** are traditionalists who hold that priests should not interfere in politics except to uphold the status quo. Berushme is a member.

**Harmony in Blue** are back to nature extremists. They seek to restore Tekumel to the 'primordial balance' before man interfered. (Their knowledge of the true history of the world is obviously poor!) The group are naturists and have retreats in the nearby lowland forests.

### Dilinála

MEMBERS: 20

CHIEF PRIESTESS: **Suronqui hiDelonuash**, 29, of Topaz Girdle clan. She is competent, ruthless and rich, as well as being exceptionally beautiful. Political leanings are not known, and she has taken no partners.

CHIEF SORCERER: **Suronqui** again. There are few ( good ) magic users in this temple.

WEALTH: Despite persistant tales of potent technomagical items none have been seen. The temple has evidence for K90,000 of liquid assets.

MAJOR SOCIETIES: **Girdle of Purity**, certainly zealots, possibly demonologists. They include Suronqui who has personal links with the temple of Hrihiyal, although none can be traced to the group.

### Belkánu

MEMBERS: 42

CHIEF PRIEST: **Tiervazha hiHrugginash**, 63, of the Amber Cloak clan. A compromise candidate 22 years ago, he has been surprisingly successful, attracting considerable gifts from the Might of Ganga clan. One of his clan-sons married a nice Gangasa clan-girl. Cautious and well mannered.

CHIEF SORCERER: **Yaliemra hiGangassa**, 37 who shocked the town when he revealed that he had been in disguise as **Kirrikmoi hiSsughano** for four years, is registered as 23rd circle (but has petitioned for the awesome 25th recently) and the Chief Sorcerer. A relative newcomer to Pala Jakalla he is rich and fat, and he is a little indiscrete on occasion, especially after too much of his favourite brandy.

Spells available: U/G Inscription, T9 Re-embodiment, T9 Viaticum of the Yellow Robe and various G/T others.

WEALTH: About K90,000 in liquid assets. A square tsan of land has recently been added in the Mssuma valley. A substantial number of TMD's are apparently in their possession. That the wealth is a recent thing is evidenced by the repairs instigated to the temple fabric this year.

MAJOR SOCIETIES: **Society of the Yellow Robe**, performers of traditional funeral rites, of the dead. 19 members, all of whom tend to be middle aged or older. The chief income generators for the temple.

**Light Above the Tomb** are undead slayers and make forays into the underworld and tombs. Led by Kirrikmoi they have a high turnover of members. Only 5 or 6 are active today.

**Cloak of Feathers**, who's 12 members are stability supporters, forming closer links with other temples. Their most surprising success has been in making links with a few priestesses of Hrihiyal and Dlamelish.

### Qón

MEMBERS: 30

CHIEF PRIEST: **Elrenu hiGangasuru**, 33, of Might of Ganga. he is known to be the figurehead of the Assistant Temple Commandant, Hareske hiDarmatek, 42, of Joyous of Vra. Hareske is an ex-adventurer and a potent sorcerer (20th), he is not only wealthy but eligable. His donations to the temple have earned him rapid promotion.

CHIEF SORCERER: **Fazhu hiDzhertikoi**, apparently transfered from the main temple on Ganga at the personal request of Hareske. (Not to be outdone by Belkanu ) Fazhu is 36, reserved and ascetic, but courteous and able to inspire respect. He came registered to 22nd circle but has lodged simultaneous petitions for 23rd and 24th circles. Fazhu is about to shock the Chief priest, and indeed the whole town, in much the same way as his twin brother **Yaliemra hiGangassa**, because he is really **Emra hiGangassa**, his twin. Yaliemra and Emra have been in hidding for four years after being accused of attempting to kill **Arsemqoi Jadthek hiVriddi General Tlangten**, but have recently been pardoned by Avanthar.

Hareske and Fazhu are alone capable of the majority of T spells, besides calling on the other 20 sorcerers in the temple. This makes the temple of Qon in Pala Jakalla a popular centre for sorcerers.

WEALTH: K45,000 plus 'interesting devices'

MAJOR SOCIETIES: **Golden Refulgence**, devotees and theological activists, have 13 members. Simialar, but not identical, to Cloak of Feathers. **Society of Release from Eternity**. Linked to **Light Above the Tomb**, possibly including Fazhu and sponsored by Hareske.

### Hrü’ü

55 known members

The Chief priest is **Taithokle hiVriddi**, born in Chene Ho from an Aridani mother. This man is practically ostracised by his original clan, but makes up for this with immense charm and cunning. His personal wealth is rumoured to be substantially greater than the temple. He takes a monthly trip into the local swamps, and always returns with fewer female slaves than he went in with.

The leading sorcerer is **Gepetkal hiSsanussanu** (19th level sorcerer, artist, poet and painter.) a specialist in crafting dreams for clients. He knows a high level of Nightmare of Terror which he has modified to be non-lethal, some consider this to be the most intense experience one can have without visiting the Garden of Weeping Snows. The client is left believing that he has truly experienced the events of the dream, which has lead to a few, accidental, misunderstandings between local nobles. His standard charge is 500k a night.

Other spells of the temple are not spoken of, but include at least T5 versions of Vindication of Instability, Congelation and Transfusion.

The temple is moderately wealthy, about K60,000 in liquid assets, and has recently come into possession of several rare books dedicated to change.

Strong local societies include **Cusp of Night**, the allies of the **N’dallu Society**, they have 15 members; obviously none are ‘open’ about it. They have the ear of the chief priest, and have grown more active recently. They have donated, through an intermediary, a hoard of weapons to the **Legion of Deep Purple Dark**.

There is representation of the **Elect of Purple**, a group of Theocrats, numbering 28 including the Chief Priest. Secretive but not fanatical.

### Wurú

19 known members.

**Ramissum hiDlelequ**, Cloak of Azure Gems is the current chief priest. A fanatic and declared homosexual, he maintains his position by posting all likely successors to far flung places. He is at present serving out a period of notice before moving to a position in a monastery near Do Chaka. Considering the current situation in the Chakas, he is trying anything he can to delay this posting.

**Jaimuli Ito** (17th sorcerer. and 15th demonologist), a recent appointment forced on Ramissum by the Ito clan has taken the role of Chief Sorceror. Jaimuli is patient and personable, but has a reputation for being overly familiar with his superiors. He is struggling financially, as he has several dozen relatives staying with him after they fled their homes in the West. He often says that only a fool would want a spell from a Wuru priest, but T7 Liquefaction is openly advertised, for engineers one assumes.

The second most potent sorcerer is **Midori Ito**, a wild and unpredictable character. (Even his renu has a reputation for insanity) He has, on one occasion, demonstrated his ability to cast Eater of Souls, and rumours abound that he once used the awful Grey Hand, on a rival for a lover. As he is immensely wealthy it is unlikely that he could be bribed into casting such spells for others.

It is a relatively poor temple, only about K25,000. They attribute this to the expense of the joint ceremonies with Hrihiyal every year.

The societies are the same as Hru'u, with 3 members known in each. The only unusual one is **Masters of the Sixth Indigo Eye**, activists and adventurers, the most infamous of whom is Midori Ito.

### Vimúhla

MEMBERS: 53; 26 in admin, 13 scholars, 13 ritualists, 1 military.

CHIEF PRIEST: **Mikolum Vriddi** was sent from Fasiltum 6 months ago to smooth over the problems caused by the insurrection in this province. He is 38 and an astute politician and administrator. He has successfully divorced himself from his predecessors attempts to corner the grain supply in the area by

way of granting monopolies to his cronies.

CHIEF SORCERER: **Tludimlal hiMarunal**, a 25th level practitioner of the Red Mountain Clan. He too came from Fasiltum recently.

They have T8 Demonolgy, T8 Revivify and T5 Perfected Gems of Obliteration available commonly.

WEALTH: Perhaps K100,000

MAJOR SOCIETIES: **Incandescent Blaze**, a highly influential group with 7 open members, of whom **Chungketl hiMalotke** of Red Moon at Dawn is leader. He is a local man and

assumed the figurehead position of 'First Flame' when Pironketl had a seizure aged 58.

**The Order of the Devouring Conflagration**, supporters of the main ritual sacrifices. **Zantlan hiEvegaz** (Red Sword ) a 23rd Circle spellcaster, and the **Aridani Mitoloni hiSerekal** (Red Sword) frequently adventure to raise funds

for the huge rites.

### Chiténg

MEMBERS: 38 at present

CHIEF PRIEST: **Kopurdal hiMakigani** of Blade Raised High is also a replacement designed to calm down the locals. 41 years old he has bought his family with him, including two sons and two daughters.

CHIEF SORCERER: **Sumikeng hiKhiteng**, a notable flame demonologist who has survived assisting Baron Jadthek several times. 22nd circle.

They can obtain Barring and Broaching and Punition to most levels.

WEALTH: K60,000, most of which is now pledged towards a new tungkel gong. The expected increase in noise levels is the source of about twelve law suits in the Palace of the Realm.

MAJOR SOCIETIES: Links are close with **Incandescent Blaze**. There is no comparative for **Devouring Conflagration**, Chiteng priests tend to join the **Company of the Orange Band**. They are devoted to personal sacrifice, frequently joining with the Hrihiyal groups at secret local shrines. They are lead by **Aridani Aranandu hiMashkolar** of Rising Sun.

**The Faithful of the Purifying flame** are a local sect headed by the ex-Chief Sorcerer, **Kutung hiKutang**. They strive to create new rituals with which to bring greater glory to their lord, and to encourage the day of Final Cleansing. As yet they have had limited success, despite several sealed caskets sent by **Mirusiya** himself.

### Ksárul

48 members, so it appears.

**Surimalal hiMarunusani**, Cloak of Azure Gems. A profound scholar and respected warrior, has the role of Chief Priest. He earned his position through military service, having previously served in a Lightening Bringer unit. At 48 he is enjoying this sinecure.

**Changasa hiNazusa** of the Dark Fear clan (21st level) is a technocrat and well known author of fictional tales. he carries the scars of an appalling accident which has resisted healing by any means. He denies persistent rumours that he travelled to the unstraightened city, yet spent several years missing prior to becoming Sorceror here.

T10 spells to understand and recharge devices are offered. T5 Replication and most G spells can be found.

The temple has expanded its fiefs and holdings of town houses recently, thanks to the extreme generosity of **Kurshetl hiSsanmirin**, a noted demonologist and researcher. (Noted because he is never seen without a mask of one sort or another). There is currently building work on the east corner, where a small windowless round room is being built with very think walls. The temple has a superb collection of ancient books, believed to include pre-Time of Darkness works. The temple is rather insular, and has hoarded artefacts over millennia. Over 50 eyes are held.

**The Society of the Blue Light**, secretists, hold sway in the temple at present. Their 28 members include the Chief Priest. They also hold the majority of library rights, a constant source of irritation to others.

**Refulgent Blue Curtain** certainly has members in the hierarchy. The key searchers are highly secretive, but have recently come into dispute with the temple of Thumis over the discovery by one of their sponsored expeditions of an ancient Miyalun and a Flute.

**N'dallu Society** of political activists have declared 28 respondents at the temple, and others outside it. The true elite within this group are obscured.

CHIEF SORCERER: **Rasnara hiDhitchansa** of Golden Bough. (22nd level) and technician of national repute. He is credited with repairing at least one ru'un for the Emperor, and is working on another that has just been recovered from a sunken metal house in the swamps.

WEALTH: Rich. About K85,000

### Sárku

45 plus unknown recruits from the dead

CHIEF PRIEST: **Masune hiKiqu** of Domed Tomb. He took over from Thontem Ito who was slain by a Demon of the Dark recently (along with several honoured Jadgi). Masune is 51, he prepares to take on his immortal form in the next year or so. Not before time according to many.

CHIEF SORCERER: Nochikor Ito. At 49 he is around 21st level with some demonology skills. Quiet, slightly built and handsome, Nochikor is a famed animal trainer.

All levels of Sarku spells can be found from the temples inhabitants, although a week's notice is preferred. Only Speculum and Amber Bulwark are freely offered.

WEALTH: The temple is crowing about the discovery of three tomb complexes, one in the swamps, one near by and one a secret. The temple has vast reserves of metals and gems 'liberated' from tombs. It has spent a fortune recently on supporting Dhitchune, but this has stopped. There is rumour that a powerful local politician is about to launch a claim for shamtla against the temple after he found a cohort of undead walking across his fief in the north of the province.

MAJOR SOCIETIES: **Copper Tomb Society** continues to rise in wealth, if not in public prestige. It has links with the tomb robbers and the N'dallu.

**Victory of the Worm** are catacomb searchers and historians. They are open about their affiliation, and include Masune. They control the most recent find, and refuse to divulge its location. (Servant say that Masune is expecting Dritchansa to visit, and wants all the Glory for himself).

### Duritlámish

MEMBERS: 21, including 9 on secondment from Purdimal.

CHIEF PRIEST: **Kherunal hi Imoni**. Never seen in public. is about 65 years old. His clan is not recorded in the public record, but he has convinced everyone that it is noble enough.

They don't advertise spells, but can obtain all levels of Necrofacture and up to T7 Domination.

WEALTH: Modest. About K35,000

MAJOR SOCIETIES: **The Angels of Inimitable Demise**, a group which is heavily into Necrofacture, and has links with the Hrihiyal Orgiasts/Demonologists. Its tastes are a little too sadistic for most.

**The League of the Putrescent Hand**, activists and adventurers have just recruited their eighth member. they sponsor many minor expeditions and have a good reputation for ridding areas of unwanted inhabitants. They lost several members to 'food poisoning' whilst on a hunting trip recently.

### Dlamélish

MEMBERS: 65

CHIEF SORCERESS: **Tlathiyala hi Korunumissa**, lover of Dhupal and equally stunning on the rare occasions that she leaves her rooms, is head of rituals. She could be 19th

Through their grip on temple treasury, via **Arikoyani hiNimosa** they effectively run the day to day affairs of the temple. They also run the various retirement homes and brothels in the town.

### Hrihiyál

MEMBERS: 55

CHIEF PRIESTESS: Among the somewhat anarchic temple rankings **Paipagel hiMeshu** of Green Kirtle and **Hiperdal Se'eqel** (a convert from Tsatssayaga) are usually put forward to speak for the temple. They are frequently outspoken and outrageous, for instance in the ornate burial mound that they commissioned for **Pathiqeng hiSsayunanu** a notorious libertine.

CHIEF SORCERER: Both **Paipagel** and **Hiperdal** are equally competent at magic, being 20th circle.

Many spells can be found from the temples practitioners, but they prefer to cast them themselves

WEALTH: Never discussed, but probably K75,000

MAJOR SOCIETIES: All of the Dlamelish societies have at least observer members from Hrihiyal.

**The Maidens of Hidden Knifes** are activists and adventurers with links into **Company of the Orange Band** and **Masters of the Sixth Indigo Eye**. Many members are concubines to wealthy nobles and military officers. **Abasudaste**

**hiMeshi**, an albino courtesan of national fame, sets up groups of Maidens in every city she visits, Pala Jakalla is the second oldest such group.

## Clans in Pala Jakalla

There are many clans represented in Pala Jakalla. Some of the more important ones include the Scroll of Wisdom Clan, worshippers of Thumis; the Green Kirtle Clan, which reveres Hrihayal (and her priestesses at the House of the Pleasant Hour…); the Silver Lightning Clan, worshipping Karakan; and the Golden Dawn Clan, which reveres Karakan. Recently, the 15th Imperial Heavy Infantry, the Legion of the Ruby Hand, has just arrived in Pala Jakalla. As these are also worshippers of Karakan, this will doubtless sway the relative importance of these religions within the city.

## Pála Jakálla Map Key:

1. **Clan of Sea Blue** [Very High]The traditional lords of the south, tracing their ancestry back to the Bednálljan royal family. Many members are highly placed bureaucrats, army officers and priests.

2. **Clan of the Golden Bough** [Very High] A southern noble clan with Engsvanyáli roots. It has strong influence in the bureaucracy, and locally many clan-members are high in the Palace of War.

3. **Clan of the Golden Sunburst** [Very High]Another Engsvanyáli noble clan, even more aristocratic than Golden Bough. The local lineages are especially wealthy, and its members prefer to exercise power through patronage and indirect influence rather than seeking public office.

4. **Clan of the Might of Ganga** [Very High] A noble clan with strong links to the priesthoods of Belkhánu, Avánthe, Thúmis and Hnálla.

5. **Clan of the Cloak of Azure Gems** [Very High] A noble clan who trace their history back to Ksárul’s officers at the Battle of Dormorón Plain. Some members worship Hrü’ü.

6. **Clan of the Blade Raised High** [Very High] Descended from the palace guards of Engsvanyáli times, this Karakán-worshipping clan is strongest in the mid-west.

7. **Clan of the Jade Diadem** [Very High] Another noble clan containing many city officials. Most members are followers of Dlamélish and Hriháyal.

8. **Clan of the Rising Sun** [High] A high clan comprising upper class merchants and some minor landed nobles.

9. **Clan of the White Crystal** [High] A venerable Jakállan clan with houses right up the Missúma river.

10. **Clan of the Joyous of Vrá** [High] Descendants of the old Vrayáni nobility, principally devoted to Hnálla, Belkhánu and Thúmis. This clan maintains a legion (the Third Imperial Slingers) and also includes many medium-level priests and bureaucrats.

11. **Clan of the Staff of Beneficence** [High] A small clan of high status whose members revere Thúmis and Keténgku. Contains many wealthy physicians, apothecaries and scholars.

12. **The Council of the Clans** A kind of guildhall used for meetings of the mercantile clans when thrashing out pricing agreements. Various celebrations are also held here, in particular the fertility rituals of the temple of Avánthe.

13. **The Shipyards of Hagárr** The base for two cohorts (800 men) of the Squadrons of Tlanéno the Steersman. There are also several commercial and Imperial shipyards, which produce both sea-going and river vessels.

14. **Clan of the Emerald Girdle** [High] A prestigious land-owning clan whose main centre of power lies upriver, although there are often members visiting the area because of the large volume of trade they are involved in. Thus the clanhouse has only a dozen permanently resident members, but with staff and accommodation sufficient to support up to fifty more.

15. **Palace of Jedusáne Tlakotáni** [Imperial] See Notable Personalities below

16. **Clan of the Standing Stone** [High] A high clan which maintains its own legion: the Second Imperial Slingers, based in the city of Ürmish. Members of the clan include priests, bureaucrats, soldiers and farmers.

17. **Blue Kirtle Clan** [Medium] A medium-status clan devoted to Avánthe. Locally the clan specialises in winemaking, though some members are priests and bureaucrats.

18. **Clan of Sweet Decay** A Sárku-worshipping clan of medium status, but with only one house in the whole empire. They specialize in the distillation of fine brandies from másh-fruit brought down from the hills near Tumìssa. The clan have a secret method for treating the fruit on its journey south that imparts particular qualities to the flavour of the liquor obtained. The purists of Tumìssa insist that it is not truly másh brandy, but this lighter decoction is more to southern tastes, and people will pay a hundred Káitars for a bottle of the best vintages. Másh brandy is not the clan’s only product; they also distil dátsu and brew ngálu (wine).

19. **Clan of the Shaded Garden** A medium-status clan who brew and serve wine and faóz (rice-beer). The clan maintains public rooms where lower-class patrons can sit and drink, and a suite of guest chambers for more distinguished guests.

20. **Clan of the Moon of Evening** [Medium] A medium-status clan specialising in trade. The Yarìsal lineage is famous for its wood carvers.

21. **Green Malachite Clan** [Medium] A clan with strong maritime links whose members include sailors, fishermen and rice farmers.

22. **Clan of the Collar of Bronze** [Very Low] A wealthy but low-status clan devoted to the transport and sale of slaves.

23. **Clan of the Green Tattoo** Another slavers’ clan, but not so wealthy as the Collar of Bronze because their warrant permits only the sale of “foreign persons brought from overseas”.

24. **Clan of the First Moon** [Medium] A medium-status mercantile clan. Some lineages have links to the Palace of Foreign Lands.

25. **House of the Pleasant Hour** This is part of the Temple of Dlamélish. A trained priest or priestess can be hired for anything between 1 and 1000 Káitars, depending on skill, comeliness and the services required.

26. **Clan of the Ripened Sheaf** [Medium] A prosperous middle-status clan devoted to farming and rural crafts. Smaller clanhouses are found in almost every village in these parts.

27. **Clan of the Red Flower** [Medium] A medium-status clan involved in shipping and foreign trade.

28. **Armoury of the Red Eclipse** This is the house of a small local clan specialising in the production of functional but unelaborate arms and armour. (The clan includes artisans who are able to work in iron and steel.)

29. **Pyramid Tomb of Prince Bekundráne** This is the largest pyramid in the necropolis. Bekundráne was the third son of Ssìrandar II, who was killed in a rebellion by the people of Ngála, a ruined city some way to the southwest of Pála Jakálla. The tomb later fell into a state of serious disrepair, although it was not looted owing to a rumoured curse. It has recently been restored to some of its former glory by Májjaq Skendrúzhzha.

30. **Tower of Tanmrúktu the Astronomer**

31. **Headquarters of the Omnipotent Azure Legion**

32. **Weapon School of Makkúdzo the Salarvyáni** Unsurprisingly for a Salarvyáni-run school the speciality is Arruché (sword &-dagger fighting), in which Makkúdzo is an acknowledged master. Other noble weaponstyles are also taught. Makkúdzo’s prices mean that his school tends to be the preserve of the upper classes, but he has been known to take on the occasional promising but poor student at reduced fees. (Price for a two-hour lesson: 15 Káitars with Makkúdzo himself, 10 with a junior instructor.)

33. **Gladiator School of Panú’ish Ketlán of Ssa’átis** Panú’ish is a former gladiator who made his fortune in the Hirilákte in Jakálla. His sponsors, the Clan of the Blade Raised High, set him up with this school after his retirement. Although his primary interest is in the training of gladiators for the Hirilákte, he can be prevailed upon to give private instruction. (A two-hour lesson costs 5 Káitars.)

34. **The Palace of the Realm** The largest of the four bureaucratic Palaces in the city, overseeing local taxes, trade, civic upkeep and law enforcement.

35. **The Palace of Ever-Glorious War** Deals with recruitment, supply, the Sákbe guard units and maintenance of the city walls. (The units of the Squadrons of Tlanéno the Steersman who patrol the river report here, not to the Palace of the Realm.)

36. **The Palace of Foreign Lands** Responsible for customs, foreign trade and shipping, and diplomatic relations.

37. **The Palace of the Priesthoods** Responsible for temple tithes, public rituals and relations between the priesthoods and the state. The ecclesiastical courts are located here.

38. **The Hirilákte** Because of the gladiator school there is a healthy level of activity at the arena, giving Panú’ish’s pupils a taste of the big time before moving them on to the arenas of the great metropolises.

39. **The Citadel of Hágarr** This citadel is of Bednálljan architecture, very solid and not particularly attractive. Its one claim to fame is that it has never fallen to a siege. That at least is what the locals claim, and certainly it has not happened in the history of the Second Imperium. It is used as a warehouse for essential supplies and any imported goods destined for the Imperial Coffers at Avanthár. This leaves a lot of unused space, most of which is left prepared for use as barracks in case Imperial troops should be billeted in the city.

40. **The Isle of Torment** The prison for those convicted by both Imperial and civil courts. The guards comprise two Semétl (40 men) of the Legion of Kétl.

41. **Mansion of Donmikáyel hiGángasa** See Notable Personalities below

## Foreigners’ Quarter

42. **The Palace of Winds** Rest-house for foreigners of royal or noble status. Prices range from 50-100 Káitars per day.

43. **The Tower of the Blue Dawn** Rest-house for foreigners of high status. Costs 20-50 Káitars a day.

44. **The Courtyards of Hirkáne** Rest-house for foreigners of upper middle status. Costs 10-20 Káitars a day.

45. **Foreign merchants’ “guild”**

46. **Ahoggyá enclave** A high wall ameliorates the rank smell emanating from these thatched log-built abodes.

47. **Shén enclave** A high wall protects the faint-hearted from any sight of these terrifying creatures.

48. **House of the Fulfilment of Dreams** This bawdy house is owned by Majjáq Skendrúzhzha and run by his brother-in-law, Zékkumet Ssámadan. They cater for all purses and tastes. Given enough time, Zékkumet will procure any type of pleasure or perversion his clients can afford. (The Temple of Dlamélish receives a 25% cut of the profits in return for allowing the House to remain open.)

49. **Hostel of Buzhúnmra** Rest-house for foreigners of middle status. Costs 1-10 Káitars a day.

50. **Fazhzhá’s House of Repose** Rest-house for those of lower-middle status. Costs 1-20 Hlásh a day.

51. **The Buzzing Domicile** Rest-house for those of low status. Costs 1-20 Qirgáls a day.

## Government Buildings

Military structures, administrative buildings, orphanages, prisons, and more compose the numerous official government structures of Pála Jakálla.

**G1. Jeggare Light (Outskirts)**: This low lighthouse’s sole keeper, Veranada hiMezzerae, was murdered by the cult of ‘She Who Must Not Be Named’ and then transformed the body into a [penanggalen](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/bestiary3/penanggalen.html) with orders to maintain the light but to allow to the Direption safe passage. Left to her own devices, Veranada could well remain in charge of Jeggare Light until after the events of Crimson Throne pass, for her ability to masquerade as human and her gift at bluffing serve her well in her new role.

**34. The Marble Mansion of Metlunel I (Longacre Building attached to The Palace of the Realm)**: The Longacre Building, also known as Arbiter’s Hall, is an imposing building that serves as both a jail and a courthouse. .

**34. The Palace of the Realm (**City Hall)

**39. The Citadel of Hágarr (Great Tower):** This citadel is of Bednálljan architecture, very solid and not particularly attractive. Its one claim to fame is that it has never fallen to a siege. That at least is what the locals claim, and certainly it has not happened in the history of the Second Imperium. It is used as a warehouse for essential supplies and any imported goods destined for the Imperial Coffers at Avanthár.

The Citadel is now being dismantled, with the huge stones being used to creation of four immense statues of Ileosa.

Ileosa starts dismantling the tower for stone to build her statues (see the Ongoing Events sidebar on page 402)

**G6. The Governor's Palace**.

**G7. Scrapper Hall** (foreigners’): Although this building is relatively small, the highly regimented work hours that slaves endure here push the limits of legality, and the staﬀ members often clash with the inspectors about inducements.

**G8. Fazhzhá’s House of Repose** (foreigners’): This mid-sized lodging house. Stories of child sized Ssudú (ghosts) tormenting an adult sized Ssudú are common.

**44. Hospice of the Blessed Maiden** (foreigners’): Until

Chapter 2 begins, this building serves the Arkona family

as a warehouse, but once the plague hits Korvosa, the city

turns this site into a front for its secret Urgathoan allies.

See Part 3 of Chapter 2 for more details.

**G10. The Palace of Ever-Glorious War** (Citadel Volshyenek): This impressive citadel houses the headquarters and main garrison of the Guard. As the campaign progresses, the

Guard suﬀers increasing attrition as their members are lost, be they killed in action, “recruited” to the Gray Maidens, or deserting their duty. Some remain loyal, but by the time Chapter 4 begins, Citadel Volshyenek feels all but abandoned. Field Marshal Cressida Krof maintains a skeleton crew of guards at the citadel from this point on, but their role in the city is largely just for show, with the expectation that the queen could well dissolve the Guard at any moment.

**--G11. Dawnﬂower House** (Midland): While all five of Korvosa’s orphanages are inspected regularly by the churches of Abadar (to ensure everything is running efciently and legally) and by Sarenrae (to ensure the children are safe and comfortable), Dawnﬂower House is the only one of the five to be run by actual clerics.

**--G12. Little House** (East Shore): The smallest of Korvosa’s orphanages is also the newest. Administered by a philanthropic halﬂing named Bek Blerkian, the Little House focuses primarily on non-human orphans.

**G13.(**40.) **The Isle of Torment (Jeggare Isle** Outskirts): A single squat fort sits atop this low, rocky isle, its roof adorned with several siege engines. The prison for those convicted by both Imperial and civil courts. The guards comprise two Semétl (40 men) of the Legion of Kétl. These days, Jeggare Isle is in large part a nostalgic historical site from the city’s violent past, and while its defenses still function, its skeleton crew can hardly man them with efficiency should the need arise.

## Homes, Inns, Restaurants, and Taverns

**H1.(1.) Clan of Sea Blue (**Arkona Palace): This manor houses Old Pala Jakalla’s de facto ruling family, the inscrutable, but feared, Sea Blue. The traditional lords of the south, tracing their ancestry back to the Bednálljan royal family. Many members are highly placed bureaucrats, army officers and priests. Arkona Palace and its dangerous guardians are detailed in full in Part 3 of Chapter 3.

**--H2. Vencarlo’s Home** (Old Korvosa): This solid, comfortable house may look old from the outside, but within, it is in excellent repair—at least, until the events chronicled in Part 1 of Chapter 3 play out!

**H3. Salvator’s Home** (east of Hostel of Buzhúnmra(49)): This run-down house, typical of so many old and decaying homes in the Foreigners Quarter, belongs to one of the city’s most eccentric artists. It is detailed in Part 1 of Chapter 3.

**--H4. Pilts’s Palace** (Old Korvosa): Up until Old Korvosa is quarantined, the buildings destined to become Pilts’s Palace are a set of ramshackle tenements. This location is detailed in Part 2 of Chapter 3.

**H5. Soldado Home** (Outskirts - Betrú Kisás): This humble home, located in the heavily Salavyáni outlying neighborhood of Betrú Kisás, is one of the first points of outbreak for blood veil. It features prominently in Part 1 of Chapter 2.

**H6.(25.) House of the Pleasant Hour, Posh and Turtle** (Luxurious): This is part of the Temple of Dlamélish.The Posh and Turtle is the finest tavern in all of Pála Jakálla. Upon entering the establishment, it is difficult not to notice the glass ﬂooring overlooking a wide but shallow sea cave, within which lives a 20-foot-long sea turtle named Old Tom. A trained priest or priestess can be hired for anything between 1 and 1000 Káitars, depending on skill, comeliness and the services required.

The proprietor is Thaviun hiRigulus of the Green Malachite clan, a noted sorcerer of Dlamélish.

**--H7. Laughing Wave Inn** (North Point; standard):The Laughing Wave is the oldest surviving inn on the mainland. It remains a favorite destination of visitors thanks to its long history and the legends surrounding the Barbarian Princess, the ghost of a Shoanti woman said to appear on certain nights of the year
