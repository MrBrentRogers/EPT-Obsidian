[ Tekumel. Thanks for sharing this, David! ]

There have been a few mentions of Pala Jakalla in the past, and I thought

that you might like the latest list of notables in the local temples. It

is meant as a quick aid, not as a complete directory, and is complemented

by similar list for the clans, palaces and foreigners, (some of which have

previously been published by Richard 'Jack' Bramah)

# THE LEADING LIGHTS OF THE TEMPLES OF PALA JAKALLA

## Hru'u

55 known members

The Chief priest is Taithokle hiVriddi, born in Chene Ho from an Aridani

mother. This man is practically ostracised by his original clan, but makes

up for this with immense charm and cunning. His personal wealth is

rumoured to be substantially greater than the temple. He takes a monthly

trip into the local swamps, and always returns with fewer female slaves

than he went in with.

The leading sorcerer is Gepetkal hiSsanussanu (19th level sorcerer, artist,

poet and painter.) a specialist in crafting dreams for clients. He knows a

high level of Nightmare of Terror which he has modified to be non-lethal,

some consider this to be the most intense experience one can have without

visiting the Garden of Weeping Snows. The client is left believing that he

has truly experienced the events of the dream, which has lead to a few,

accidental, misunderstandings between local nobles. His standard charge is

500k a night.

Other spells of the temple are not spoken of, but include at least T5

versions of Vindication of Instability, Congelation and Transfusion.

The temple is moderately wealthy, about K60,000 in liquid assets, and has

recently come into possession of several rare books dedicated to change.

Strong local societies include Cusp of Night, the allies of the N'dallu

Society, they have 15 members; obviously none are 'open' about it. They

have the ear of the chief priest, and have grown more active recently.

They have donated, through an intermediary, a hoard of weapons to the

Legion of Deep Purple Dark.

There is representation of the Elect of Purple, a group of Theocrats,

numbering 28 including the Chief Priest. Secretive but not fanatical.

Wuru

19 known members.

Ramissum hiDlelequ, Cloak of Azure Gems is the current chief priest. A

fanatic and declared homosexual, he maintains his position by posting all

likely successors to far flung places. He is at present serving out a

period of notice before moving to a position in a monastery near Do Chaka.

Considering the current situation in the Chakas, he is trying anything he

can to delay this posting.

Jaimuli Ito (17th sorcerer. and 15th demonologist), a recent appointment

forced on Ramissum by the Ito clan has taken the role of Chief Sorceror.

Jaimuli is patient and personable, but has a reputation for being overly

familiar with his superiors. He is struggling financially, as he has

several dozen relatives staying with him after they fled their homes in the

West. He often says that only a fool would want a spell from a Wuru

priest, but T7 Liquefaction is openly advertised, for engineers one

assumes.

The second most potent sorcerer is Midori Ito, a wild and unpredictable

character. (Even his renu has a reputation for insanity) He has, on one

occasion, demonstrated his ability to cast Eater of Souls, and rumours

abound that he once used the awful Grey Hand, on a rival for a lover. As

he is immensely wealthy it is unlikely that he could be bribed into casting

such spells for others.

It is a relatively poor temple, only about K25,000. They attribute this to

the expense of the joint ceremonies with Hrihiyal every year.

The societies are the same as Hru'u, with 3 members known in each. The

only unusual one is Masters of the Sixth Indigo Eye, activists and

adventurers, the most infamous of whom is Midori Ito

Ksarul

48 members, so it appears.

Surimalal hiMarunusani, Cloak of Azure Gems. A profound scholar and

respected warrior, has the role of Chief Priest. He earned his position

through military service, having previously served in a Lightening Bringer

unit. At 48 he is enjoying this sinecure.

Changasa hiNazusa of the Dark Fear clan (21st level) is a technocrat and

well known author of fictional tales. he carries the scars of an appalling

accident which has resisted healing by any means. He denies persistent

rumours that he travelled to the unstraightened city, yet spent several

years missing prior to becoming Sorceror here.

T10 spells to understand and recharge devices are offered. T5 Replication

and most G spells can be found.

The temple has expanded its fiefs and holdings of town houses recently,

thanks to the extreme generosity of Kurshetl hiSsanmirin, a noted

demonologist and researcher. (Noted because he is never seen without a

mask of one sort or another). There is currently building work on the east

corner, where a small windowless round room is being built with very think

walls. The temple has a superb collection of ancient books, believed to

include pre-Time of Darkness works. The temple is rather insular, and has

hoarded artefacts over millennia. Over 50 eyes are held.

The Society of the Blue Light, secretists, hold sway in the temple at

present. Their 28 members include the Chief Priest. They also hold the

majority of library rights, a constant source of irritation to others.

Refulgent Blue Curtain certainly has members in the hierarchy. The key

searchers are highly secretive, but have recently come into dispute with

the temple of Thumis over the discovery by one of their sponsored

expeditions of an ancient Miyalun and a Flute.

N'dallu Society of political activists have declared 28 respondents at the

temple, and others outside it. The true elite within this group are

obscured.

the swamps, one near by and one a secret. The temple has vast reserves of

metals and gems 'liberated' from tombs. It has spent a fortune recently on

MAJOR SOCIETIES ARE:

recruited their eighth member. they sponsor many minor expeditions and have

several members to 'food poisoning' whilst on a hunting trip recently.

The Order of the Devouring Conflagration, supporters of the main ritual

sacrifices. Zantlan hiEvegaz ( Red Sword ) a 23rd level mage, and the

Aridani Mitoloni hiSerekal (Red Sword) frequently adventure to raise funds

for the huge rites.

The Faithful of the Purifying flame are a local sect headed by the ex-Chief

Sorcerer, Kutung hiKutang. They strive to create new rituals with which to

bring greater glory to their lord, and to encourage the day of Final

Cleansing. As yet they have had limited success, despite several sealed

caskets sent by Mirusiya himself.

Chiteng

MEMBERS:

38 at present

Kopurdal hiMakigani of Blade Raised High is also a replacement designed to

calm down the locals. 41 years old he has bought his family with him,

expected increase in noise levels is the source of about twelve law suits

in the Palace of the Realm.

MAJOR SOCIETIES ARE:

Links are close with Incandescent Blaze.

There is no comparative for Devouring Conflagration, Chiteng priests tend

to join the Company of the Orange Band. They are devoted to personal

sacrifice, frequently joining with the Hrihiyal groups at secret local

shrines. They are lead by Aridani Aranandu hiMashkolar of Rising Sun.

Dlamelish

MEMBERS:

65

CHIEF PRIESTESS IS :

Dhupal hiKorunumissa of White Crystal is nominally in charge. She is of

immense physical beauty, but short tempered. She served 10 years in the

temple Legion serving groups fighting in the Deserts.

CHIEF SORCERESS IS :

Tlathiyala hi Korunumissa, lover of Dhupal and equally stunning on the rare

occasions that she leaves her rooms, is head of rituals. She could be 19th

level.

Tlathiyala has recently taken on an assistant of 18th level who fled from

Liviyanu and required a new body after surviving assassination by burning.

Rumours are the girl is a historian and has phenomenal aptitude for magic.

Healings, and Empowering are available up to T8 (higher sometimes)

WEALTH:

K95,000 or so

The demonist Order of Argent have 5 women members and are supposed to be

involved with the temple of Ksarul.

The orgiastic Society of Emerald Radiance are rumoured to use demons,

technomagical devices and even the undead in bizarre rituals.

The Sisters of the Emerald and Silver Crown are activists and foster links

with the Chiteng and Wuru activists. Through their grip on temple

treasury, via Arikoyani hiNimosa they effectively run the day to day

affairs of the temple. They also run the various retirement homes and

brothels in the town.

Hrihiyal

MEMBERS:

55

CHIEF PRIESTESS IS :

Among the somewhat anarchic temple rankings Paipagel hiMeshu of Green

Kirtle and Hiperdal Se'eqel ( a convert from Tsatssayaga ) are usually put

forward to speak for the temple. They are frequently outspoken and

outrageous, for instance in the ornate burial mound that they commissioned

for Pathiqeng hiSsayunanu a notorious libertine.

CHIEF SORCERER IS :

Both Paipagel and Hiperdal are equally competent at magic, being 20the

level.

Many spells can be found from the temples practitioners, but they prefer to

cast them themselves

WEALTH:

Never discussed, but probably K75,000

MAJOR SOCIETIES ARE:

All of the Dlamelish societies have at least observer members from Hrihiyal.

The Maidens of Hidden Knifes are activists and adventurers with links into

Company of the Orange Band and Masters of the Sixth Indigo Eye. Many

members are concubines to wealthy nobles and military officers. Abasudaste

hiMeshi, an albino courtesan of national fame, sets up groups of Maidens in

every city she visits, Pala Jakalla is the second oldest such group.

Belkanu

MEMBERS:

42

CHIEF PRIEST IS :

Tiervazha hiHrugginash, 63, of the Amber Cloak clan. A compromise

candidate 22 years ago, he has been surprisingly successful, attracting

considerable gifts from the Might of Ganga clan. One of his clan-sons

married a nice Gangasa clan-girl. Cautious and well mannered.

CHIEF SORCERER IS :

Yaliemra hiGangassa, 37 who shocked the town when he revealed that he had

been in disguise as Kirrikmoi hiSsughano for four years, is registered as

23rd level ( but has petitioned for the awesome 25th recently ) and the

Chief Sorcerer. A relative newcomer to Pala Jakalla he is rich and fat,

and he is a little indiscrete on occasion, especially after too much of his

favourite brandy.

Spells available: U/G Inscription, T9 Re-embodiment, T9 Viaticum of the

Yellow Robe and various G/T others.

WEALTH:

About K90,000 in liquid assets. A square tsan of land has recently been

added in the Mssuma valley. A substantial number of TMD's are apparently in

their possession. That the wealth is a recent thing is evidenced by the

repairs instigated to the temple fabric this year.

MAJOR SOCIETIES ARE:

Society of the Yellow Robe, performers of traditional funeral rites, of the

dead. 19 members, all of whom tend to be middle aged or older. The chief

income generators for the temple.

Light Above the Tomb are undead slayers and make forays into the underworld

and tombs. Led by Kirrikmoi they have a high turnover of members. Only 5 or

6 are active today.

Cloak of Feathers, who's 12 members are stability supporters, forming

closer links with other temples. Their most surprising success has been in

making links with a few priestesses of Hrihiyal and Dlamelish.

Qon

MEMBERS:

30

CHIEF PRIEST IS :

Elrenu hiGangasuru, 33, of Might of Ganga. he is known to be the figurehead

of the Assistant Temple Commandant, Hareske hiDarmatek, 42, of Joyous of

Vra. Hareske is an ex-adventurer and a potent sorcerer (20th), he is not

only wealthy but eligable. His donations to the temple have earned him

rapid promotion.

CHIEF SORCERER IS :

Fazhu hiDzhertikoi, apparently transfered from the main temple on Ganga at

the personal request of Hareske. ( Not to be outdone by Belkanu ) Fazhu is

36, reserved and ascetic, but courteous and able to inspire respect. He

came registered to 22nd level but has lodged simultaneous petitions for

23rd and 24th levels. Fazhu is about to shock the Chief priest, and indeed

the whole town, in much the same way as his twin brother Yaliemra

hiGangassa, because he is really Emra hiGangassa, his twin. Yaliemra and

Emra have been in hidding for four years after being accused of attempting

to kill Arsemqoi Jadthek hiVriddi General Tlangten, but have recently been

pardoned by Avanthar.

Hareske and Fazhu are alone capable of the majority of T spells, besides

calling on the other 20 sorcerers in the temple. This makes the temple of

Qon in Pala Jakalla a popular centre for sorcerers.

WEALTH:

K45,000 plus 'interesting devices'

MAJOR SOCIETIES ARE:

Golden Refulgence, devotees and theological activists, have 13 members.

Simialar, but not identical, to Cloak of Feathers

including Fazhu and sponsored by Hareske.

Avanthe

MEMBERS:

61

Berushme hiBedlenta, an Aridani of Golden Bough. She is 58 and a

traditionalist who supports the Imperial party. She recently won a case

against Chaihellu hiSsanmirin, who suggested she was bisexual. ( she is a

declared lesbian ).

CHIEF SORCERER IS :

Arkin hiSengele, 44, of Blue Sun. He is 16th level. His taste in women is

expensive beyond his ability to manage his forest estates. He is rumoured

to be heavily into debt and to be seeking buyers for certain hunting areas.

There are few good sorcerers, most people travel to Jakalla to obtain

anything above T5 Healing..

WEALTH:

K150,000 plus considerable estates of farms on the flood-plain.

MAJOR SOCIETIES ARE:

Sapphire Bough, blessers of crops. 27 members of this popular group, mostly

low level sorcerers.

Wellspring of Life are traditionalists who hold that priests should not

interfere in politics except to uphold the status quo. Berushme is a member.

Harmony in Blue are back to nature extremists. They seek to restore Tekumel

to the 'primordial balance' before man interfered. (Their knowledge of the

true history of the world is obviously poor !) The group are naturists and

have retreats in the nearby lowland forests.

Dilinala

MEMBERS:

20

CHIEF PRIESTESS IS :

Suronqui hiDelonuash, 29, of Topaz Girdle clan. She is competent, ruthless

and rich, as well as being exceptionally beautiful. Political leanings are

not known, and she has taken no partners.

CHIEF SORCERER IS :

Suronqui again. There are few ( good ) magic users in this temple.

WEALTH:

Despite persistant tales of potent technomagical items none have been seen.

The temple has evidence for K90,000 of liquid assets.

MAJOR SOCIETIES ARE:

Girdle of Purity, certainly zealots, possibly demonologists. They include

Suronqui who has personal links with the temple of Hrihiyal, although none

can be traced to the group.

Karakan

MEMBERS:

68

CHIEF PRIEST IS :

Kurrishmoi hiPejikhel, 58, Aridani of Blade Raised High. She rose to her

current lofty position by a successful diplomatic carreer in the Palace of

War. She is regarded as diplomatic and able.

CHIEF SORCERER IS :

Hirjan hiFashulara the 46 year old chief of Fist of Iron is 17th level. He

teaches children of noble clans but is rumoured to be a little greedy. He

is also a very capable warrior and was a champion athlete before he

'settled down to a bit of mind bending'. He strongly encourages magic and

the temple can find a good range of T spells.

WEALTH:

K180,000 in ready assets, more in armour and arms.

MAJOR SOCIETIES ARE:

Rent Curtain. These anti-Ksarul fanatics are frequently in trouble for

their activities elsewhere in the Empire. There could be one or two of

them in the city.

Glorious in Scarlet, Imperialists and politickers. Kurrishmoi and 39

others are avowed members

Crimson Brothers have few members, they seek to propagate the (nearly

heretical ) view that Karakan and Vimuhla have a closer relationship than

current theology admits. This is a violent belief, which leads its

followers into wild excursions in search of any scrap of proof that they

are right. Ancient tombs and old texts are a favourite target.

Chegarra

MEMBERS:

35

CHIEF PRIEST IS :

Chaihellu hiSsanmirin, 49, of Sea Blue. An active supporter of the Userper

Eselne, he narrowly avoided impalement after the Rectification of the

Emperors. A 'bluff, honest soldier', his own description, he is famed for

the number of shamtla cases he has had raised against him. Since the

Rectification of the Emperors he has conceived of a hatred of sorcery, and

of Kashu hVorodu.

CHIEF SORCERER IS :

Vacant, and has been for two years. Applicants should be prepared for

disappointment. The previous incumbent took his skills to Jaikalor, along

with almost every talented mage over 11th level, following an ill-fated

trip into the small underworld beneath the town.

WEALTH:

Only K25,000 declared on the last tax round. the temple is believed to owe

large sums to the temple of Karakan.

CHIEF PRIEST IS :

Herenru hiMriku, of Sea Blue. A dynamic 38 year old who is rumoured to be

a powerful socerer as well as a capable scholar.

CHIEF SORCERER IS :

Surprisingly the local temple lacks any declared ability to perform T level

healing or allieviation, only G level known. They can repair Eyes and have

a text on the subject. They buy any damaged items.

WEALTH:

They have recently spent large sums on new inner temples and repairs to

their estates. Despite donations from influential foreigners they have only

K15,000 in cash now.

MAJOR SOCIETIES ARE:

Ketenku

MEMBERS:
