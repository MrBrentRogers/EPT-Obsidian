**Shopping in Jakálla**

_In Jakálla, you can buy anything… or anybody._ **_— Firu baYéker, Imperial Scribe_**

Jakálla’s markets are some of the best in Tsolyánu, for she is a major port city and center of trade. Shops cater to the highest of the high (Prince Rereshqála maintains a household near Jakálla) and the lowest of the low. The upper-class shopping district along The Street of the God-King Nemándu contains stores to fill many needs of the wealthy. At the other end of the spectrum, a surprising number of good shops are located in the Foreigners’ Quarter — the better clans of Jakálla have an especially strong tradition of avoiding any taint of commerce, and have tried their best to keep lower and middle- class commercial activity away from their clanhouses.

We have not attempted to list all shops in Jakálla; they number in the hundreds. Instead, we have concentrated on some few representative ones, including the best in town. Within a category, shops are listed roughly in ascending order of “quality.” While lower or middle-class merchants will deal willingly (though not always happily) with those of lower social standing, upper-class establishments will generally turn away customers of quality insufficient to their establishment. Careful attention to this listing should serve to avert that sort of embarassment. (See The Rating System, below, for details.)

Foreigners in Jakálla are advised that many merchants will refuse to deal with them unless they have attained status within the Empire. Many merchants who will deal with them will happily overcharge, even if they are generally honest traders. For large, or otherwise important, purchases, foreigners and newcomers are well-advised to hire one of the helpful and knowledgeable individuals listed under the Facilitators heading below.

**The Tsolyáni Shopping Experience**

Tsolyáni shops are very different from what most Earth people are used to — there are no displays of merchandise, no price tags, and often no doors!

Most shops have open archways or colonnades facing the street, perhaps with an awning that can be installed during the rainy season. A customer enters, and comes into a room furnished with seating mats. The general custom is to take off one’s shoes and sit down on a mat. (Stores catering to soldiers and other “rough” types — this includes most of the weapons shops — will generally have two sets of mats; the sturdier ones are for those who prefer to keep their boots on, and woe betide the hapless shopper who wears his boots on the wrong mat!)

After you seat yourself, a servant will come in to ask you your business. He or she will then depart, and be replaced by another servant bringing chumétl or watered wine. The quality of the refreshments varies with the quality of the establishment and the shopper.

Once you have had a chance to refresh yourself (and in hot, steamy, Jakálla, this is vital!), either the merchant or an employee will join you, and ask questions about your sword (or whatever weapon you are buying) technique and your preferences. Servants will then bring wares out for you to examine and see if they are acceptable. If they aren’t, the servant will whisk them away. After a dialogue with the “salesperson,” and numerous iterations of the process, you decide what, if anything, you wish to buy.

Then the bargaining starts, for any prices the merchant has given are but negotiating positions, and may bear more or less resemblance to the item’s true worth based on how he feels about the customer. (Foreigners, if allowed in a shop at all, often get an especially rough time.)

There are exceptions to this process. In very high-class establishments, prices may never be mentioned until the purchase is delivered to your clanhouse later. Nobles, after all, aren’t expected to understand money. Foreign merchants may behave differently, as their cultures dictate. And bargaining with non-humans can be an amusing or harrowing experience, depending on the circumstances!

Merchant Status Ratings

The number of Imperial Seals shown indicates the minimum status needed to patronize a given establishment. Status is often, but not always, an indication of the quality of the establishment’s wares; read the descriptions to be sure.

Armories

Armories are shops specializing in the sale, and usually the manufacture, of weapons and /or armor. A wide range of weaponry and armor is available in Jakálla, ranging from the execrable, through serviceable military-grade items, on up to masterpieces of the armorer’s art, such as those traded by such worthies as Néku of Béy Sü and the estimable Nikún hiTlakotáni. Even weapons of steel, or rare magical pieces, are available — provided you have the money to pay for them, the knowledge to find them, and the connections to get in the door.

Armories often serve not only as places to buy weapons, but also to test them. Many have practice yards that serve as social centers for martial types — off-duty soldiers, swords for hire, and the like. As a result, you can often find hired “muscle” on short notice out back of an armory, though quality varies.

**Armory of Bushétra the Smith**

**Foreigners’ Quarter**

**Bushétra hiViriggán, proprietor**

This black-bearded Salarvyáni sells melee weapons and armor — but he is best known for his bows, crossbows, and archery supplies. Though it is unusual for an armorer to handle both melee and missile items, Bushétra has a reputation among archers and crossbowmen across Tsolyánu for his wares. He does buy and sell ancient armor and weapons; quality and quantity vary.

[description of his shop]

Bushétra is a grizzled, bearded, balding man, who is stern and will not bargain much. A resident of Tsolyánu for more than thirty years, he is quite wealthy and is prominent within the Salarvyáni community in Jakálla.

**Armory of the Silver Gauntlet**

**Foreigners’ Quarter**

**Moyél hi Vársha, proprietor**

This shop deals primarily in armor, though it often has some weaponry available. Overall, the quality tends to be pretty low, and steel is almost unheard of. The clientele is primarily lower-class; Moyél will deal with foreigners, but will raise his prices for them. Be warned!

The Armory of the Silver Gauntlet has a large front stoop, with two pillars flanking its arched opening which leads to a cavernous long hall. It is not especially distinctive, but you should be able to see people examining and trying on chlén-hide armor through the archway. It’s somewhat run-down, with grubby mats; there is no practice yard.

Moyél himself is a pleasant old duffer, a veteran who will talk at length about his days in the Legions under Emperor Hetkoláinen, battles he fought in, and Imperial missions he was assigned, until you wonder if he’s forgotten that you came there to buy armor. Bargaining with him can take quite a while, as he’s more interested in the talking than in making the sale. Beware his chumétl; it’s painfully hot (too much hlíng-seed) even by jaded Jakállan standards!

**Armory of Vrí of Púrdimal**

**Foreigners’ Quarter**

**Vrí hiVarúse, proprietor**

Sells both weapons and armor, both of fairly good quality, including fine armor in the classic Púrdimal style. Vrí has connections, and will occasionally come across a steel weapon. (Very occasionally, ancient weapons or armor will turn up; it is best not to ask about their provenance.) Located a block and a half from the Temple of Karakán, Vrí does much of his business with guards from that temple and from the Temple of Chegárra.

You can easily identify this shop by the model of a suit of armor (it looks vaguely like temple guard armor, but is clearly fake) to the left of its low entrance.

Vrí is an unpleasant little man, full of vinegar. He hates foreigners, hates animals, and barely tolerates everyone else. On the good side, he is extremely efficient and quite knowledgeable about his trade. As you might expect, he is a hard bargainer; you probably won’t get him to come down once he names his price. You also won’t succeed in getting him to talk about anything but business, should you bother to try. His servants may be the swiftest in the city, as they fear his stick should they be too slow returning with an item to show a customer.

It is worth noting that there are two Vrís — Vrí hiVarúse, who operates the shop and is from Púrdimal, and Vrí hiKakúvu, who actually owns the place. Both manufacture armor, but hiVarúse generally deals with customers, and is the one described above.

**Armory of the Omniscient Eye of the Emperor**

**Foreigners’ Quarter**

**Boká hiChársha, proprietor**

A military supplier, this armory generally deals in quantity. Most of its clientele — as its proximity to the Temple of Karakán suggests — comes from stability-oriented temple guard units and Imperial legions. Though he tends to deal in standard-issue military gear, Boká will occasionally buy a nice piece from a soldier who is short on money. (Steel equipment will be marketed to the wealthy through connections; it will not appear in his shop.)

The Armory of the Omniscient Eye of the Emperor is also, strangely enough, known as a place where soldiers who lack the status or money to visit the House of the Pleasant Hour can find companionship. Though a Karakán worshipper, Boká has connections with the Temple of Dlamélish; junior temple staff often hang around his place watching the soldiers train and making conversation. The apartment house across the street is popular for assignations, as a lot of the temple maids, scullions, and serving girls live there.

The shop itself is quite large, sort of L-shaped, and has two entrances on different sides of the block. It goes around the small stand-alone apartment house in the center of the block. There is a large, reddish stone pillar, about [8 feet -- convert] tall, in front of the south entrance; it’s covered in worn inscriptions. (The blocky, sharp-pointed characters on the pillar look like they might be Bednálljan, but they are too worn to read.) It looks like it some long-dead person dug it up and put it there — but even though you have to walk around it to get in the door, Boká has never gotten around to moving it.

Boká himself is an average-looking, somewhat plump, man in his 50s. He is a nice enough person, but slightly crooked. If you are knowledgeable, or if you have connections at the Temple of Karakán, he will treat you well and give you a good deal. If you are a foreigner, or ignorant, he may well try to charge you more than you should pay. (Boká often dresses down, so be careful not to mistake him for one of the servants lest you get on his bad side!)

**Armory of the Shield of Imperial Valor**

**Foreigners’ Quarter**

**Diréka hiKhamiyál, proprietor**

A middle-of-the road chlén-hide armory, supplying weapons cheaply, and in quantity, for the military. It very rarely gets steel, and when it does, it winds up getting marketed up the social ladder through connections.

The entrance to this shop is marked with a fake chlén-hide shield, tricked out with a fancy-looking fake Imperial Seal on it in blues and white. (Depicting the Seal in this way is technically illegal, but Diréka has not gotten into trouble for it yet.) The opening to the shop faces south, and is basically an open hallway leading back into semi-darkness, with a long, flat step going up. Beyond the shop is a small practice yard, generally filled with soldiers and bodyguards looking for employment. It tends to be a busy place.

Unless you are making a large purchase, you will not see Diréka himself. He is a short, fat, balding man, with only a hank of hair left on his forehead. Diréka is a pleasant fellow, though generally quite busy. He is friendly enough, but has a group of cronies he prefers to socialize with.

**Armory and Smithy of Ghr´y of the Vermillion Helm**

**Pála Jakálla Harbor**

**Ghr’y the Ghatóni, proprietor**

Ghr’y carries a wide range of weaponry, which is rumored to include exotic items such as assassin weapons and devices. It is also rumored that he has a stash of steel weapons in the basement, and that he may have magical items as well. If so, he probably markets them to very influential, very shady people; he is believed to be well-connected with pirates and other unpleasant folks. His pettiness has probably saved him from Imperial inquiry.

In addition to being a weapon dealer, Ghr’y is also a smith. He has, unusually, a forge capable of melting and casting even iron, and can repair metal objects. He mostly sells marine materials, but will also sell swords and bronze pieces (he makes banding for masts, for example). Ghr’y will sell steel when he can get it.

The shop is located off the Plaza of the Emperors, across from the prison guards’ barracks. You have to walk deep into a wet, sticky alleyway — we do not recommend that you do this without an armed escort! — at the end of which are a number of steps leading up into a [50’ square] hall covered with worn and weathered sculpture. His shop is through a round-topped archway. (This was once a much better district, and is now, alas, fallen on bad times.) The forge is in a grubby area out back.

Ghr’y is a dark-complected man in his 40s or 50s, with a mouth like a slash. Though he claims to be a Ghatóni, nobody is quite sure where he is really from — and as he never talks except about business, nobody is likely to find out. Though he is courteous enough, he is not interested in extraneous conversation; he expects customers to transact their business and get out. In fact, you will not see Ghr’y himself unless you specifically ask for him.

**Armory of the Mighty Sword of Karakán**

**Temple District**

**Nikunár hiSaráika, proprietor**

This is a fancy place, catering mostly to officers and officials from the Palace of the Realm across the wall to the east. Nikunár’s clientele includes the Governor’s Guards, officers of the Omnipotent Azure Legion, and the like — people who are trying to look like they are someone, whether or not they actually are. This shop carries dressy stuff, but it is eminently usable. It occasionally has steel weapons, though not antiques. (You can also get high-grade service-quality weapons and armor here.)

Nikunár can dress up existing weapons and armor; he outsources work to artisans expert in putting colors and lacquer on chlén-hide, and polishing gold and silver to a high gleam. He can also get more elaborate work done, including embossing your name on your sword blade, fancy cloisonne enameling, or setting jewels into scabbards and hilts. This kind of work is expensive, and takes about a week, but is of uniformly high quality.

[What does this shop look like?]

Nikunár hiSaráika is tall, slender but not skinny, and middle-aged (50s), with gray hair flowing down from a high forehead, fastened back with a fillet of ribbon. He dresses well, always with a smock with the symbol of his clan, the Blade Raised High. Nikunár often brags about being descended from the nobility of the Engsvanyáli empire. He is nice enough, provided you treat him with honor and respect — and provided you have money. Expect no bargains, though, for Nikunár watches his profits carefully.

**Armory of Néku of Béy Sü**

**East Jakálla**

**Néku hiKhúrsa, proprietor**

The second-finest armory in Jakálla, this shop caters to legion officers, high-status soldiers, and rich people seeking expensive gifts. Néku is a master at making gloriously fancy weapons and armor, and also carries a great deal of historical material (especially from the Engsvanyáli period). He has access to the inner sanctums of upper-class clanhouses, and to the Governor’s palace; he can move rare and expensive material for a fee.

Néku’s shop is right across from the barracks of the Legion of Heketh of Purdimal, in the remains of an average district that has now been built over by people who are fairly high clan. It is between two towers, a beautiful white building with pilasters around the outer sides. The door to the west, opens to where the tower is, and the north door leads out thru long narrow street, north to the legion barracks. The shop has a fancy marble floor in several colors, and was probably originally a clanhouse.

Néku himself is a big, ugly, gruff gladiator who made a tremendous amount of money in the Hirilákte arena and has retired here. Despite his appearance, he is anything but stupid. Women love him; rich women come to buy fancy bits of armor and weapons for beloved gladiators in the arena, and gifts for loved ones.

**The Ultimate Establishment of Niyún hi Tlakotáni**

**East Jakálla**

**Niyún hiTlakotáni**

This is the fanciest place in town by a wide margin — so fancy, in fact, that it borders on offense to call it an armory. Niyún hiTlakotáni deals in very important weapons, as well as in some artwork and other material. If you want something fancy, he is without peer. He can also have things done to weapons that you would not believe, including etching, and fancy intaglio carving in gemstones. It goes without saying that he has ready access to steel, and perhaps even magical, weapons — but unless you are of the highest quality, you will never find out.

To get to his shop, you go in off a small wharf, straight across the street, through several small streets and lanes, until you come to an open area with vines and flowers. The Ultimate Establishment has a tasteful embossed door, with Niyún’s name and clan engraved in fancy script upon a brass plaque. Knock at the door and servants will admit you and politely ask your business; if you are not of proper status, they will make excuses and send you on your way. To get past them, you will need to be dressed properly and have knowledge of etiquette, as well as having good breeding.

Once you get inside, the shop looks much like a clanhouse, with an atrium, open to the sky, filled with trees and shrubs. You will be offered comfortable seats, and beverages in exquisite glassware (red Mu’ugalavyáni glass, or lavender glass from Púrdimal). Once you have refreshed yourself, Niyún himself will come out. He will talk as if he is your friend, and this is a social visit — it is an extreme breach of etiquette to deal with him as if he is a merchant, or as if you are actually transacting business. You must be indirect — “I am seeking something, and a friend said you know a great deal” — and accept his “help” as it is offered. If you are fortunate, he will say that whatever you seek is easily found, and will have a servant show it to you. Prices are never discussed; if you think something is too expensive, hint at clouds in the sky, or other metaphors for darkness. Once it shows up at your clanhouse — especially if you have asked for custom work — you ask his servant how much, and you do not bargain.

True to his Tlakotáni heritage, Niyún looks every inch a God-Emperor. He is a great, big, handsome man in his late 40s or early 50s, graying at the temples, with a barrel chest, and a powerful jaw. He dresses gorgeously, and has a stable full of wives and concubines, and many children.

Marine Outfitters

Shops in this category carry a variety of equipment for use on and with ships — ranging from brass hardware, to ropes, to bottom paint, lanterns, cookstoves, and the like.

While marine outfitters do sell weapons, they do it as merely a part of their main business — outfitting ships. They primarily carry weapons used on shipboard, such as cutlasses, short pikes, and crossbows.

Both of the shops in this category carry high-quality merchandise; by the nature of their businesses, however, they are willing to deal with a wide range of people.

**Armory and Marine Outfitting Workshop of Grekka the Yán Koryáni**

**Pála Jakálla Harbor**

**Grekka hiMastlén, proprietor**

Grekka is the personal supplier to Tlanéno the Steersman. He does not do heavy boat repairs, or shipbuilding, but can supply bottom paint, lanterns, cutlery, pulleys, lines, and sails — and he can also get 2,000 swords on short notice. He is utterly loyal to Tlanéno, and any steel equipment he buys from sailors goes straight to the Admiral.

To get to his shop, you come in one of the lanes off the harbor, and go east up a narrow little lane. It leads for about [150-200 feet] through a narrow little passageway, winding behind garbage piles and tenements. The door to the shop is small and low. It is the one (there are several) with a sign on it, in peeling paint, that looks like it was probably once a crab — as the shop itself was probably once a fishmongers’. Inside is a hallway that goes back into the building, with a standiung rack of swords. There is often a crowd of chlén-hide and rope merchants, as well as ship personnel.

Though Grekka is a Yán Koryáni name, the man himself is smaller and sleeker than most Yán Koryáni; he doesn’t really look the part. Grekka has a perfect Tsolyáni accent. He claims that he fought in the wars on the side of Tsolyánu, then went back into Yan Kór under Emperor Hetkoláinen. He had all kinds of problems in the military, so he resigned and set up this shop. His four strong sons now do most of the work. Grekka is an honest man, though if he thinks you are in any way opposed to Tlanéno, he will not sell you the good stuff.

**Armory and Marine Outfitting Workshop of Hlél, the Fist of Glory**

**Músa Jakálla Harbor**

**Hlél [lineage?], proprietor**

This shop mostly deals with civilian shipping — the merchant trade. Hlél has a number of non-human and foreign customers; his is one of the few places in Jakálla that makes and sells foreign and non-human weaponry. It is not uncommon to see Mu’ugalavyáni, or even Shén, in his store.

The shop has a large, open gateway that leads off the street to the north, close by the harbor. It is a very nice, well-kept, building, with all kinds of fancy things — netting, glass floats, and the like — hanging on the walls.

Hlél is fairly rotund, a small man with round features. If you are upper-class, he is courteous and polite to a fault, using more honorifics than strictly necessary. To the lower classes, he is rude — though he treats seamen well, and their officers get genuine respect.

Weapons Schools

We have included a list of some of the most famous (and hence most exclusive) weapons masters in Jakálla and their schools. Those of the lower classes can often find instructors for a small fee in the practice yards of the city’s armories (see Armories, above).

**The Threshold of Glory (Viumél hiArkódu)**

The tutor to the children of Prince Rereshqála, Viumél is a renowned expert in short and long one-handed swords, as well as two-handed swords.

Tuition ranges from 900 to 1000 Káitars.

**The Tower of the Twelfth Arrow (Tiluné hiVárchal)**

An elderly master, now, alas, going blind — but still a competent and capable teacher. Specializes in long bows and composite bows.

Tuition ranges from 700 to 900 Káitars; students are responsible for supplying their own arrows.

Resthouses

For those whose clans do not have houses in Jakálla, or for foreigners visiting our glorious Empire — of Jakálla sees a multitude, owing to the importance of our port — Jakálla has a selection of resthouses. Newcomers to Jakálla are advised to hire a local guide to take them to the resthouse appropriate to their station; the streets of the Foreigners’ Quarter hold dangers to those who are unfamiliar with them, and it also avoids the awkwardness of selecting an inappropriate resthouse.

Resthouses are listed in descending order of quality. (Please note, though, that ratings have been reduced by one in all cases to reflect the presence of foreigners.)

**Lordly Domicile of the Hand of Hrúgga**

**Foreigners’ Quarter**

**Otlenásu hiTúnmiyel, proprietor**

For foreigners and visitors of noble status.

[description of building]

The proprietor, Otlenásu, comes from a noble lineage in Thráya, but has lived in Jakálla for some twenty years. He is tall, stooped, precise, and punctilious. Otlenásu is an expert on proptocol and social customs; newcomers to Jakálla would do well to ask and heed his advice. He has four wives, three sons, and a daughter (who is rumored to enjoy strenuous recreations in the Temple of Hrihayál, much to her father’s dismay).

Clothiers
