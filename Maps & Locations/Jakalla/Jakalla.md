**Description of the City**

Ancient Jakalla slumbers in luxurious, decadent splendour above the yellowish tidal flats, cut in two from east to west by the darker waters of the Equnoyel River. With its Ditlana already over 400 years overdue, the site of the present-day city has been occupied since at least the time of the City States of the Triangle – some 30,000 years – and was probably occupied before that; after all, Jakalla is the “City Half as Old as the World”. The city became capital of the First Imperium from –22932AS to –22882AS; its name at that time was Ja’akath, which became Ja’akal in Middle Engsvanyali before becoming the Jakalla of today. Famed for its Jakallan wines and sea products, the city is a centre for the worship of Dlamelish; its population is now in excess of 500,000; with the average lifespan of a citizen of Jakalla at some 43 years, there could be anything up to 9 million dead bodies in and around its City of the Dead.

Jakalla is renowned for the sensuous rhythms of its songs and its dances.

The actual location of cities drifts over the millennia; the current City of the Dead, for example, is located over old parts of Jakalla, and the priesthoods must keep digging down to get to their old temples and holy sites.

The average temperature range in Jakalla is 26-40°c; in the height of summer, temperatures can reach as high as 51°c.

**History of the City**

During the First Imperium, before Pavar, the deity dazzling Chotl the Blinding Sun (an Aspect of Ksarul) was worshipped in Jakalla. In –18784AS the ancient temple of Sarku in Jakalla was sold and torn down. Ssirandar I, Emperor of the First Imperium, moved the capital from Purdanim to Jakalla for the next 2 generations, until his grandson founded Bey Su. In –3639AS, after the Fall of Ganga and during the Time of No Kings, the city was the site of a war between the Jakallans and the Hlutrgu and Hluss.

Jakalla has moved quite some distance over the years - parts of the underworld are under water, for example.

**Legends of Jakalla**

**Nyelmu and the Garden Under Jakalla**

Little except for legend is known of the mysterious Nyelmu and his “Garden of the Weeping Snows”. It is known that Nyelmu (the name has to do with “sleep” or “dream” in Engsvanyali) seems to have offended the Lords of Stability; some say this occurred at Dormoron Plain; others claim it was more recent, and had something to do with the Heroes of the Age during the Engsvanyali period. At any rate, he seems to have been condemned to dwell in the Garden until the End of the Cycles of Time; he is one of the most bored and saddest individuals one will ever meet, always seeking some new toy or pastime, and his comrades in the garden include many who have somehow wandered in there and become trapped.

Getting into the Garden itself is easy; one of the gates (which seems to open into a different Plane and not just into another area of the Underworld) lies in one of the lower levels underneath Jakalla. Once in, however, one cannot get back out. Not only does the gate not work, but the Pale Legion (Nyelmu’s silver-and-white-garbed soldiers) will stop the fugitive and take him to Nyelmu, who may then have the hapless victim put up on a special torture display dais to beautify the Garden. Using an Excellent Ruby Eye when the victim is suffering the most then makes the agony a permanent moment throughout time. This may last for eternity, or until Nyelmu grows bored and tries something else on the hapless victim.

The Garden itself is rather a large place (area unknown), with pure white plants with cotton-like leaves and flowers growing thickly all over it. There are paths of blackish, shining stone running in crisscrosses everywhere, and the Pale Legion (usually in squads of 20 or so) move easily around in it. These soldiers are human[oid] but are clearly constructs, and possibly androids. Nyelmu’s great black palace rises at one side of the apparent cavern in which the Garden exists, and it has many rooms, colonnades, balconies, and areas too numerous to be gone into here.

Nyelmu does receive some information of events in the outside world. He is curious about political developments, in particular about the possibilities of Princess Ma’in becoming Empress and perhaps freeing him (it is said that Nyelmu’s personal goddess is similar to Lady Dlamilish…). Nyelmu has plotted in he past to lure Ma’in down into his Garden, then hold her hostage until the Emperor (or the College at the End of Time) makes a deal with him. Without her, of course, history would be messed up, and many new and perhaps unwanted branches would perhaps arise and grow from the great Tree of Time.

## Nayari of the Silken Thighs

In the time of the First Imperium, Nayari of the Silken Thighs cast her husband the Clanmaster of Purdanim into the sealed shrine of the Goddess of the Pale Bone (“She Who Cannot Be Named”) in the labyrinths beneath Jakalla.

# Recent Events in Jakalla

## The Resurgence of the He'esa

There have been several attacks in Jakalla by persons who have turned to slime when killed. The attackers have been tentatively connected to She Who Cannot Be Named.

**The Massacre in the Necropolis**

Recently, a Semetl of the Tomb Police in Jakalla have discovered some recent excavations in the upper gallery of the outer halls of the tomb of Famuel the astrologer. Beneath the three faces of the gateway to the astrologer’s tomb, a pit had been dug, uncovering an even older stairwell adorned with inscriptions in ever-enduring praise to the glories of the Worm and the Emperor Durumu Tlakotani, “The Copper Blade of Sarku”.

Believing this to be an entrance to the collapsed tomb of Nikuma III and a major treasure find, the Tirrikamu has petitioned for the rest of his Kareng to be assembled, as a show of force to encourage the tomb robbers to come to an equitable solution. In response, however, the tomb robbers struck back at the Tomb Police from ambush, killing many of the Kareng’s Changadesha in the first few moments. As desperate reinforcements rushed to the battle, the tide was beginning to turn, until, with most of the tomb police’s Tsurum in the gallery, a terrorising shriek shattered the gallery, crumbling the roof as some abominable, loathsome, gibbenous horror arose from the depths of the underworld, rending both tomb robbers and tomb police alike with frightening glee, laying waste all around until both the forces of policeman and robbers lay shattered and dying.

With the Tsurum of the Tomb Police decimated and down to maybe 25 men, and the forces of the tomb robbers probably shattered beyond recovery, the situation looks bleak.

**The Society of Jakalla**

1. **The Clan of the White Crystal**

The Clan Head in Jakalla is Neqo hiArsanmra, who in spite of his unimpressive height and impressive girth, is a mellifluous speaker and a skillful politician. He has helped the clan prosper, in spite of the civil war - or perhaps because of it, since he has sold grain and hides and other supplies to Prince Eselne, to Prince Rereshqala, and to the Imperium.

Supposedly Engsvanyali, like its "parent", the Clan of the White Stone, the Clan of the White Crystal is one of the agricultural clans of the Engsvanyali Empire. Its members often became local officials, and now it is famous for its numerous bureaucrats all across the Empire. No one knows when it was founded, but it is supposed to have been during early Engsvanyali times somewhere near Jakalla or north along the River.

Vurosa hiTukun of the White Crystal is clever, rather dishonest, and tremendously wealthy and influential. The Tukun lineage is said to date back to a hero of Dormoron Plain, but this is a fiction: it is probably no older than late Ensgvanyali times.

### Members of the Clan of the White Crystal

- Barik hiVezhre, sorceror-priest of Karakan and military-priest in the Legion of Serqu;
- Korikadan hiVezhre, worshipper of Sarku and kasi in the Legion of Serqu;
- Ssochne, the Shen slave of Korikadan and follower of Durritlamish;
- Gachakoi hiArsanmra, worshipper of Qon (and possibly a member of a secret society);
- Ksenchu hiAkhutho, priest of Dlamelish and (until recently) believed by the clan to be dead;
- Narel hiTukun, former soldier and veteran of the war with Yan Kor until suffering a debilitating head wound;
- Maleya hiÜthsuke, wealthy Aridani girl currently of the Golden Sapphire clan;
- Zu'ena, a N'lüss half-breed Aridani warrior, member of the Clan of the Scarlet Mantle and Maleya's constant companion.

**Accommodation in Jakalla**

The poorest visitors to the city who cannot stay with clan relatives must endure the insects, bad food, and human riffraff of the Tower of the Red Dome; the Hostel of Birruku the Allaqiyani is appropriate for those of lower-middle station; the Court of the Fourth Emperor serves guests of upper-middle rank; the Palace of Mruthri offers suitable accommodations to those of the upper class; and the opulent Lordly Domicile of the Hand of Hrugga is patronised by the wealthy and aristocratic. Nonhumans will find premises fitted to their needs in their own sectors of the foreigners quarter.

Run by the Clan of the Scarlet Sash, the Band of Noble Diversion, and the Bright Victory Clan, among others. Used for duelling to resolve disputes as well as gladiatorial combat. Slaves, POWs, beasts, nonhumans, criminals, and professional gladiators are brought in. Private persons, clans, some military legions, and the war temples sponsor gladiators, and teams of foreign champions also come to gain honour. Gladiators and wrestlers must obtain approval of the city-ruler or presiding officier (and the crowd) to kill an opponent, though it is usually given.

Games, athletic contests, and annual ceremonies of governments, temples, clans, etc, are also held in the arena.

Open daily during the cool months, once a week in autumn and spring, and closed in the hot summers.

Types of noncombat events include footraces, archery and javelin-throwing competitions, acrobatic demonstrations, and clowns. The game that draws the best is Marotlan, in which four teams of five players view to take a golden sceptre back to their home “colour”. Body blocking is allowed, but not grappling or weapons. Teams may ally themselves with others, and bribing players from an opposing team to join yours with promises is legal. Only one team can win, and losers lose their clothes along with their wager.

1. **The City of the Dead**

Lies to the east of the City. The poorest of the city are buried in special Grave Pits or thrown into the Gulf of Porudaya. The noble dead are indeed buried in mausolea underneath certain sites in the City of the Dead. Many of the minor clansfolk are buried in lesser graves in small graveyards on the clan lands, and some of the really minor - slaves, labourers, etc. are just put into the ground with no rites or grave goods. In a couple of years the insects do their work, and the "grave" can be used again for somebody else. All of the high clans do NOT bury their dead in one mausoleum, of course: each has an entrance that leads to its own burial sites.

Jakalla’s city of the dead is traditionally patrolled by a Tsurum of the Tomb Police, of the Clan of the Open Sepulchre. Like most Tsurum of the Tomb Police, this is essentially nothing more than an oversized Kareng, with no more than 150-200 Changadesha, but the extra officers have helped with the patrolling of the Underworld and offered more prestige to the Clan of the Open Sepulchre.

The need for such a police force in the Jakallan City of the Dead is obvious when one considers the riches buried by the high clans of the Empire in the graves and sarcophagi of their dead. Buildings such as ”The Hall of the High Clans”, a great oval-shaped edifice in the City of the Dead, is a common entrance to the Underworld areas where all the High Clans, such as the White Crystal Clan and others, have their parts of the Necropolis.

Like most cities of Tsolyanu, the burial grounds of Jakalla have always been beset by thieves and tomb robbers. Some of these tomb robbers organise into gangs and companies to match the tomb police, mainly made up of brethren of the Clan of the Nighted Tower, but also a number of disreputable foreigners (Jakalla has traditionally been plagued by ignorant foreigners and immigrants). Traditionally, however, an understanding has existed between the tomb police and the tomb robbers, which has been rewarding to both and has avoided confrontations.

1. **The High Gate of Chaimaktel**

The gate in the City Walls nearest to the Necropolis is called "The Gate of Bones" by some of the lower classes. Its proper name is "The High Gate of Chaimaktel." She was the mistress of Ssirandar I. The name is doubtless apocryphal - the gate wasn't built until the last Ditlana -- about 800 years ago.

**Miscellaneous**

The map of Jakalla never did have a scale, and hence the big buildings are MUCH too big, and the smaller houses, shops, etc. are much too small and constricted. The map should be redrawn, but who has time or energy? Most of the clans have lands around Jakalla anyway, and clanmembers tend to live outside of the city on their own lands, rather than cramp the clanhouse in town.

**The Underworld**

The Tsuru’um of the City of Jakalla is said to be one of the most extensive of any in the Five Empires. There are entrances to Jakalla’s Underworld both through the City of the Dead and through the drainage tunnels and sewers of the city proper. Immediately below the modern sewage system lies a layer of passageways which meanders hither and yon across several square kilometres. Two important subterranean shrines are maintained here: those of Hru’u, the Supreme Principle of Change, and Dlamelish, the Green-Eyed Lady of Fleshly Joys. Hru’u’s temple rambles for many hundreds of metres through mighty halls, apartments, barracks, refectories, dungeons, robing rooms, libraries, outer sanctuaries of his various Aspects, ceremonial chambers, etc, before finally reaching the Y-shaped twin inner shrines peculiar to this sect. Here, in a welter of gleaming gold, purple amethysts, indigo star sapphires, eddying blue clouds of Vres incense, and the tremulous shimmer of a thousand candles, the demon-masked hierophants of this mighty god celebrate the ritual of The Coming Forth of Universal Diversification.

The Temple of Lady Dlamelish is smaller but has several vertical levels, each appropriately guarded. On those nights when the moon Gayel is full, her orgiasts come to dance before their goddess, while father down in the maze her priestesses call forth the demon Ru’utlanesh, “The One of Mouths”, and make appropriate sacrifice. These rituals cannot be described to the squeamish – or to the uninitiated.

Most of the temples of the other Tsolyani deities also have subterranean sanctuaries below Jakalla, although these are smaller and of less importance. For example, there is a priestly academy and a library of the Temple of Thumis, a strange circular temple to Chiteng, the Cohort of Vimuhla, and several others of note. Also on this upper level is an underground branch of the Equnoyel River, the River of Silence, in the midst of which is a misty island where it is said that the demon Srukarum, master of dread Sarku’s undead legions, dwells – or perhaps it is Missum, great Death himself. No-one knows, and few return to speak of it.

The lower layers of Jakalla’s Tsuru’um do not lire directly below the uppermost level but are displaced to one side or the other due to the city’s changing patterns of habitation over the aeons. There are several Engsvanyali levels, other of the Bednalljan period, still lower regions built by earlier dynasties, and eventually a ruined, twisted level of metal passages datable to the age before the Time of Darkness. All are interconnected, and as one approaches the nethermost one feels a current of cold air which blows up from the caverns within the very bowels of the planet. No mortal has ever ventured so deep – or returned to speak thereof.

Most of the Engsvanyali levels are dark and empty, peopled only by the creatures which haunt the depths and feast off one another. There is the curious shrine to the demon Hes, “He Who Laughs Forever”: he causes those who are ignorant of the rituals to laugh and play pranks upon one another until they drop from weariness or even perish from breathless exhaustion. On a still lower level is the tomb of the Engsvanyali Prefect of the South, Rekmilish III, whose sepulchre is encircled by a curved passage in which a mighty juggernaut car rolls around and around, crushing any who have entered there. The car cannot be stopped or avoided; the entrance to the passage closes and becomes indistinguishable; and the victims can only escape if they manage to discover the secret door which leads on into the tomb. This place, too, has its guardians: powerful bronze-hued automatons who must be defeated before the chests of gold and gems may be opened. This part of the Underworld is also haunted by the demoness Lelmiyani, “the Sweet Singer of Doom”, who manifests herself as a little girl playing upon a flute. If her music mesmerises a party, she will lead the explorers on willy-nilly through the massive bronze gates of the Garden of the Weeping Snows, and what transpires there has been described above.

Still farther down and somewhat off to the north of the present city, the Bednalljan levels of the Underworld are said to contain the rich tomb of Mnekshetra, the Lesbian mistress of Queen Nayari of the Silken Thighs. Upon emerging from the labyrinth into the tomb area, one first encounters the Hall of One Thousand Columns. These are carven with the likenesses of the Queen’s casual male lovers – and are said to contain the bodies of those unfortunates themselves. Beyond this is another intricate labyrinth which eventually leads into an elegant chamber made to look like an open courtyard, the sort of opulent place of dalliance which the Queen and her lover enjoyed in life. In the midst of this is a bathing pool into which it is perilous to look. There are sleeping apartments, furnishings, all of the trappings of a princess – and beyond again, concealed by secret doorways and trapped with devices of stone and bronze, is the tomb itself: a crystal sarcophagus in which the beautiful Mnekshetra sleeps attired in all of her regalia and her insignia of power. This tomb can only be opened safely by one who knows the Pandects of Impunity. Some say that this tract may be available elsewhere in the tomb or in the labyrinth. Others claim that the only copy exists in a lost and insignificant-appearing manuscript once contained within the great library at Tumissa. In any case, attempting to open the tomb incorrectly is said to result in the party’s being transported back through time to stand face to face with wrathful Nayari herself, surrounded by her guards, her sages, and her nonhuman minions. Any return to the present – or even the continuation of life itself – then depends upon the party’s ability to flatter and cozen the Queen and assuage her anger.

The Bednalljan levels give entrance to a still lower regions constructed by the Dragon Lords. Here stands the shrine of Vimuhla, a blackened tower of monolithic stones surrounded by a moat of leaping flames. The only access is a rail-less bridge less than a metre wide high above the roiling inferno. Men tell tales of a treasure of fire opals within this temple – enough to buy a man a kingdom – but guarded by the demon Jneksha’a, “the Scythe of Flame”, and thus inaccessible to any but the cleverest and bravest of thieves. As the Tsolyani proverb has it, “Sweet is the harbour, but Death is the ferryman”.

#### Pala Jakalla

The capital city of Jakarsha Province, Pala Jakalla is situated on the headlands between the estuaries of the Missuma and Rananga rivers. The walls encompass eight hills that rise above the low country of the Flats of Tsechelnu, with the city of the dead built on the ninth.

The population of the city is approximately 45,000; its name means “Yesterday Jakalla”, and is probably the original site of Jakalla up to the collapse of the Three States of the Triangle. Ideally situated as a staging post for goods coming from the centre of the empire down the Missuma River. Pala Jakalla is located roughly one day’s travel north of Jakalla.

## Clans in Pala Jakalla

There are many clans represented in Pala Jakalla. Some of the more important ones include the Scroll of Wisdom Clan, worshippers of Thumis; the Green Kirtle Clan, which reveres Hrihayal (and her priestesses at the House of the Pleasant Hour…); the Silver Lightning Clan, worshipping Karakan; and the Golden Dawn Clan, which reveres Karakan. Recently, the 15 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) Imperial Heavy Infantry, the Legion of the Ruby Hand, has just arrived in Pala Jakalla. As these are also worshippers of Karakan, this will doubtless sway the relative importance of these religions within the city.
