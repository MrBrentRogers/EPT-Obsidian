**History & Geography of Jakálla**

Jakálla the Mighty, the Mistress of the Empire — those who would disparage her, mostly jealous Northerners, have ruder names for her — is one of the oldest cities in Tsolyánu. La, though she is a bit worn about the edges, she is still glorious; and who among us would hope to look better after twenty millenia?

Though Tsolyáni speak of “Jakálla” having been around for twenty millenia, the truth is that there have been a series of settlements at or near the mouth of the Eqúnoyel river. And whatever these settlements were, they probably weren’t called anything remotely similar to “Jakálla” until the time of Nayari, when it was called “Ja’akath.”

The major population center in the area has moved three times — it was originally to the Northeast, in what is now swampland, then out in the present Jakálla Bay, and now, since the sinking of Engsvan Hla Gánga, at the current site. The earliest ones didn’t really even overlap with what is now Jakálla, except perhaps for an “underlap” of subterranean tunnels which gave access to the sea or to other small settlements.

Very little is in fact known about “Jakálla” in those earlier periods, because very little is known about those periods themselves. There are no written records available of the Three States of the Triangle period, for example, which leaves scholars with naught but meager archeological evidence and the legends — all of which are probably false or at least distorted. There are rumors that the Chancery in Avanthár has books from those times, on leaves of gold, but the Emperor isn’t saying.

Ditlána — Urban Renewal, Tsolyáni-Style

_If we do not do Ditlána, we are no better than beasts! — CITE SOURCE_

Ditlána, the custom of renewal, has taken place four or five times in Jakálla that we know of. Traditionally, one razes existing buildings to their foundations, and then rebuilds them atop the pile in the same general style. As a result, the city keeps getting higher and higher — a desirable side effect, considering Jakálla’s proximity to the sea and her low elevation. The temple areas rise especially fast, as temple foundations are unusually high; much of the Temple District is now about 50’ above the surrounding plain.

Levels buried by ditlana can become part of the city’s underworld. Because Jakálla is so old, and has moved several times, her underworld covers quite a large area and is unusually complex. (See Beneath Jakálla.)

It is perhaps worth noting that, by most reckonings, Jakálla is about 500 years overdue for ditlána. Given the current state of the Imperium, one is not even a remote risk until things stabilize — but after that, who knows?

History

In “The City Half as Old as the World,” history is a fact of life. Every day, one walks (or is carried) past buildings dating back centuries, or even millenia. Those who claim to be the first families of the city have been living in the same homes, albeit rebuilt again and again, for ten thousand years. In Tsolyánu, only Avanthár and Púrdimal can claim greater antiquity — all the other great cities, Bey Sü, Fasíltum, Usenánu, and the rest — are but new-sprung settlements… to a Jakalláni.

For Jakálla has been continuously occupied for as far back in history as we can tell, and most likely farther still — perhaps even in the time of the Ancients, before Tekumel’s isolation from the rest of humanspace. Its site on the delta of the mighty Eqúnoyel, with natural harbors giving access to the ocean, is an obvious site for a city

Interestingly, Jakálla’s actual location has moved over time. Some of this migration is due to the alluvial shifting of the land around the delta. Indeed, were it not for the efforts of Jakállan dredges throughout the ages, the constant flow of silt from the Eqúnoyel would have created vast tracts of swampland reaching far into the ocean. Following the fall of Gánga, however, Jakálla also moved — as part of the city was lost beneath the waves.

The oldest parts of Jakálla’s underworld, therefore, are flooded, requiring special magic to enable one to breathe (and perhaps even to withstand the pressure at depth), though few have returned to tell the tale, and those who have returned seem unwilling to share their experiences.

Ancient Times

During ancient times, the main settlement was to the northeast of the present city, in what is now swampland. Jakálla (though it was not called that until the Time of No Kings) was a river port, not a seaport, though it had a better harbor than those on the muddy delta itself.

Some brave souls who have ventured deep into the underworlds beneath Jakálla have returned with tales of metal-walled passageways, leading off to the northeast, and ancient writings. These passages are very deep indeed, and go on for many tsán; some are filled with silt or water.

The Three States of the Triangle

Jakálla, possibly under a name similar to Ja’akath, was the southern capital of the Three States of the Triangle (Úrmish was the western one, and Thráya the eastern). Very little is known about this truncated state, which grew out of the wreckage of the Empire of Llyán of Tsámra.

What is known is that there was probably more than one settlement in the area. The primary city was much smaller, and was farther out in the bay, in what is now the harbor. Regrettably, any relics remaining of Jakálla’s days as capital of the Three States are now buried under some six hundred feet of silt and mud.

Any remnants from this period probably were not from that city, but were actually part of its northern suburbs — portions of villas, fortifications, and the like. Jakálla still posesses a few coins, bricks, and buildings that date from the Three States period — little more than a surviving brick here and a brick there that have stamped seals bearing the blocky Llyáni-like writing of the time, and cartuoches of long-lost monarchs.

If you wish to see these remnants of Jakálla’s ancient heritage, go first to the large tower to the southwest of the Governor’s Palace. This thick-walled building was originally a Three States fortification of some sort, and much of the original walls, though built upon in succeeding periods, still stand. The Governor’s Palace itself has courses of brick beneath it dating from the Three States period, but they were built over in the Bednálljan and Engsvanyáli periods and may not be open to public view.

The Temple of Karakán contains a colonnade dating in part to the time of the Three States of the Triangle. A suitable donation to the Temple’s coffers should gain you admittance — and a knowledgeable tour guide, for the priests of Lord Karakán take pride in the history of their temple, and have preserved the ancient bricks for public viewing, along with a few coins they recovered from the site. (The colonnade is sometimes used for classes in the Temple school, so it may not always be open to the public; it is best if you send a servitor ahead to make sure.)

The Dragon Warriors

By the time the Dragon Warriors arrived, the Three States had grown weak and foolish. The fearsome warriors from the north announced that they wished to have the city, and Glorious Jakálla — never a city of warriors to this day; we prefer more refined pursuits and the finer pleasures of life —surrendered to their rule without a fight.

Once the Dragon Warriors took Jakálla, they built fortesses all the way down the coast, hoping to control the whole area. They hung on to Jakálla for centuries.

Little else is known about this time in Jakálla.

The Fisherman Kings

After centuries, the “Fishermen Kings” — Gámulu and his sons — rose to brief prominence. The Fisherman Kings found Jakálla a much harder nut to crack than had the Dragon Warriors. Perhaps several hundred years under the Vimuhla-worshipping Northerners had made warriors of the Jakalláni, or perhaps the galleys of the Fisherman Kings were too far from home, and without support; in any event, their ships and seige equipment were not equal to the task. They beseiged Jakálla, but failed to overcome her.

Frustrated, the forces of the Fishermen Kings simply went home, leaving Jakálla to her own devices and leaving much of the west in the hands of the Vimuhla worhsippers of the Bednalljan successor kingdoms.

The First Imperium

This was the time of evil Queen Nayári, Nayári of the Silken Thighs, and of the Bednálljan Empire and lost Purdánim. Scholars have speculated that Nayári may have lived in Jakálla at some point as a courtesan, and had learned to love the city, for as Queen, she lavished attention on Jakálla, rebuilding parts, constructing other parts anew, and dedicating the city to Lady Dlamélish. Though Nayári ruled from Purdánim, she spent a great deal of time in Jakálla.

Nayári’s story is well known, so we will not repeat it here, except for a few brief excerpts. One of the earliest legends of Nayári in Jakálla is that, after working her way up to marrying the Clanmaster of Purdánim, she had the poor man immured, naked and alone, in the sealed temple of She Who Cannot Be Named beneath our city.

Nayári’s lesbian mistress, Mnekshétra, who has lent her name to an array of potions and nostrums, lived in Jakálla. The evil Nayári’s counsellor, confidante, and lover supposedly lies entombed beneath the city, close by the tomb of her Queen — but if any know the location of her burial place, they are not saying.

After Nayári’s death, her children squabbled over her empire. Finally, one of her sons attained the throne. Ssirandár I, as he styled himself, moved the capital of the Imperium to Jakálla, leaving Purdánim and its horrific past behind to wither away. Ssirandár I became a ruler of considerable power, managing to forge Nayári’s strife-ridden state into a true empire. He built many structures in Jakálla, including its impressive city walls. The Sákbe road system began in Jakálla, under his reign.

About a century after Nayári’s death, Ssirandár I’s grandson, Utékh Mssá, decided in turn that Jakálla was too hot, too sticky, and filled with terrible memories. Echoing the actions of his grandfather, he again moved the capital — this time commanding that a new city be built, on fresh ground. Utékh Mssá raised the city now called Bey Sü upon virgin soil, and forced Jakálla to undergo its first, and most extensive, period of ditlána. No longer the capital of an empire, Jakálla settled into a role similar to that which it holds today — a wealthy and powerful port city, ruled by mighty governors reporting to their rulers in Bey Sü.

Many structures still stand in Jakálla from the Bednálljan period. Perhaps the most spectacular is the impressive pyramidal tomb of Ssirandár I, which looms over the City of the Dead. Nayari’s tomb lies in ruins in the northeast corner of the City of the Dead, though she herself is rumored to be buried somewhere beneath present-day Jakálla.

Within the city proper, the landward sections of the city walls were first built in Bednálljan times, but have been added to since then. (Other structures? e.g. temples, etc. Governor’s palace?)

In many ways, the First Imperium was a time of glory for Jakálla, and one that has marked her to the present day. A number of clans that are powerful in Jakálla trace their lineage to the First Imperium. The Clan of Sea Blue are descended from Bednálljan nobility, and some of the Emerald clans (Emerald Diadem, for example) trace their heritage to Nayári’s court. The Clan of Green Malachite claims descent from Nayári herself.

Engsvanyáli Period

In Engsvanyáli times, Jakálla (called Ja’akath in the earlier days, becoming Ja’akal toward the latter portion of the empire) retained its prominence as the great northern seaport, counterpart to mighty Gánga across the waters to the south. Jakálla was made so rich that it, unusual among the major cities of Engsván hla Gánga, never rebelled.

[put info from Eng history here]

When the Great Calamity occurred, and Gánga sank, much of Jakálla was lost with it. Jakálla suffered earthquakes, tidal waves, and much ruination.

jak was much smaller, and was out farther in the bay ion what’s now the harbor. when ganga sank, some of those areas sank w ganga -- gt tect plates sank in s and rose in n. jak suffered earhquakes and much ruination. the old, old latter times city is long gone -- probably farther n and east than city of dead, under thousands of feet of silt and topsoil.

Time of No Kings

It was during the Time of No Kings that Jakálla became known by the name she bears today. The Temple of Avanthé in Jakálla has the best of the fragmentary materials covering the Time of No Kings in the Empire.

Geography

at the base of a mighty river, so constant flow of silt and sediment from N which makes bay shallow. eventually would create a vast delta. Dredging is a major operation; the guy who does it has become rch dredging relics out of it

Jakálla itself built ona point of fairly solid rock — great sedimentary, yellowish colored rock, largely lime, with sand deeper below. still deeper, and bits of outcroppings in various places. slopes down gradually from e to w. the pointed area, the rise in far w where temples are, is the underlying rock. go farther s, you’ll find large areas of ytellowish-grey mudflats, and flat ugly yellowish river fish, full of worms, that eat all the garbage that flows out of Jakálla (which is considerable)

go to n, come to the pt where musa and pala Jakálla, the suburbn cities, are. even larger in extent than jak itself — no walls, and no imperial edict that keeps them from expanding. city of thedea is in the way, and emps would be upset if tried to build much beyond villages which already exist. pala and musa very popular in terms of middle class, lower-class laboring environment. the old , old labor class clans in jak itself are squarely in the ctr of the city, just n of the turn in the equ river.

note map not to scale; representational as per tsol culture.

the old city consists of the mid and lower class areas in the n central; great fort in the top which is walled ans is a port which leads to pala harbor (military shipping, hq of marine detachmts). to the w, can see foreigners qtr, the temples begin there and work back along eq river. to s of river are great esplanades where high culture exists. raised above water several mtrs high on platforms of natural stone, then artificial astone above that. commercial harbor in far sw corner. (high commercial harbor; shipping clans are all around it -- real commercial harbors in pala and musa -- whole lot of small businesses and things based on ships and seafaring nearby) little islands and other things build up the city.

you can easily see demographic breaks -- distinct between each area -- foreigners qtr, old city ion n central, great temple esplanades to central and s, in the far e side, the great clans, the very high commercial areas, fancy manuf aloing banks of river (shipping areas there too, w smaller wharves and smaller riverine ships that sail up to thraya and jaikolor) arena to ne is large, ancient, and has many related businesses around it -- manuf of arena stuff -- arms, armor, banners, wreaths etc..

old clanhses in far central e and se of city are the gt clanhouses of the city; there are many more than on map, v stylized. same with city of dead in far ne -- large empty mass of very ancient ruins and hillocks and piles of material. hses of embalmers, those who make amulets for dead, tombs, etc , all live out there in largely unsupervised barracks and small village situations. it’s mixed in are the gt pyramids and esplanades for emps and govs tombs -- much has fallen into ruin. fRther east out of jak, find agricultural area, peas vill with 50-200 hses. along sakbe rd are merc estab and small cities.

gvernor’s palace on outcrop in mid of equ. sticks up higffher than the rest, bec sits on promontory of prominent sandstone, and the sandstone only barely overlies really ancient prom of heavy volcanic rock. not v high, but high enough to overlook ct=ity from where it is. govt palaces are s of there.

history

gds of those times mostly lost, or not known to us in any real sense -- modern tsol will say it’s a form of a ncurrent god, or an aspect. lady dlamelish, whose city this is generally assumed to be, didn’t come to prominence until eng times, after pavar’s gods thor constructed. pavar’s deities don’t come up until long after bednallj times. when ganga began to rise, jak was already thous of yrs old, had gone thru many rescensions, so lady dl comes along as a later ruler of the city and everybody sorta assumed it’s her city, bec people of the city seemed to take to her like a duck to water and she’s the patron of som many activities in jak.

time of nayari the beautiful, and great purdanim, now lost

queen nayari didn’t start in jak (noone knows where she came from) people think purdanim ne of Jakálla in those plains. one party saw it one time when floods washed away part of the topsoil, but couldn’t find it later bec flood had re-covered it. she sent gov to live and rule in jak. first ssirandars and bash? ruled from jak. great tombs of early emps in jak. uttek mssa moved capital from jak to bey su.

ssir 1 was ruler of considerable power; took reins of nayari’s cobbled-together kingdom and made a real kingdom out of it. she ruled by her -- how shallwe say, charisma -- and managed to bamboozle a number of local leaders, gahered lovers both male, female, and other, it is rumored. legends grow all the time. go to temple of dlam or hse of pleasant hour, and they’ll regale you for hours and hours with stories of nayari and ths fellow or that fellow, bec more and more fantastic all the time, all kinds of hilarious anecdotes abt her sexual prowess. v wise in some ways, but totally ruthless. completely realistsic; no illusions abt what would happen if she failed for a single second. gt purdanim lords were mightly in their power.

did they move capital to jak when nayari took over? or later?

mnekshetra -- nayari’s lesb lover; gt beauty and talent; no interest in males except putting them to death. one of n’s greates counselor;s; wise, intelligent -- but played a little too closely w demon lords lady m was called one of the “wizards”, but wasn’t really -- therea re potions in the mktplace you can buy “lady m’s thorughly effulgent potion for the raising of the penis”(kinda ironic), a number of nostrums atrtibuted to her. interests in medicine, alchemy. entombed beneath jak, v close to nayari’s tomb. actual location not known. m was not the only one of n’s lovers -- stable of males, females, others devoted to her. there’s a time and place for everything um was a powerful ruler with no qualms abt doing what he thought needed to be done. changed the nature of things. built roads and highways, estab schools, commerce. rebuilt taxation system.. bey su still his lasting great monument. accomp. something that’s still visible.

nayari had thunru’u servitors -- this is a powerful magic method in latter times,, domination and brain reconstruction methods to be used to create servit of more intell than species usu has, sometimes used, highly unusual, rare. (renyu w swords and armor)

jak becomes backwater

sometime later, comes Pavar.

>2. Where are the clanhouses of the Dark Flame and Ito clan located

>(approximately) in Jakálla?

Both are in the southwestern quadrant of the city, down near the Pyramid

of the Unnamed God (no. 51 on the original EPT list and on the map).I see I have made a mistake in the location of the clanhouses asked for.

They are in the southEASTERN quadrant of the city of Jakálla, not the

southWESTERN.
