**Jakalláni Culture**

_Jakalláni culture? Isn’t that a little redundant? —_ **_Shekkára Tlakotáni, expressing a popular sentiment among Jakalláni_**

Americans are used to a single, unified, national culture. Changes from one end of the nation to the other generally take the form of “local color—” down South, people eat grits and say “y’all,” while in New England people eat quahogs and don’t say much.

This is true for the US because we have fast communications, mass media, and high mobility. It is not as true in Britain,even, where some dialects in use today are mutually incomprehensible (Glaswegian and Cockney, say), and it is not true in Tsolyánu at all.

There are common cultural elements across Tsolyánu; there is, after all, a single language, a single government, and internal trade. There are also, however, dramatic differences, because Tsolyáni tend to pretty much live in the same place all their lives — and there’s nothing even approaching a mass media.

So when we talk about Jakalláni culture, we’re not just talking about minor variations like the fact that the first name Qolyému is almost unheard of outside the city. We’re talking about major, culture-shock-grade differences in lifestyle and outlook, as compared to any other city in the Empire. If your character has never been to Jakálla before, he or she is in for an interesting, and foreign, experience.

Though Jakalla is thought of by other Tsolyani as a “looser” sort of place, visitors often find themselves being looked down upon for their lack of etiquette.

A contradiction? Not quite —

For the point of loosening etiquette is to do it in a way that demonstrates that you know the rules, and are deliberately flaunting them, rather than breaking them through ignorance. You also have to know not only when it’s okay to flaunt the rules… but when it’s okay for you to flaunt them.

Our best advice? Seek guidance from your local clan-cousins; they’ll know the ropes. Watch your use of pronouns —there are some in common use among the Jakalláni upper classes that haven’t been applied elsewhere since before Engsván hla Gánga sank—and try to acquire the gentle grace with which native-born Jakalláni bow and speak. And by the Gods, don’t make noise when you chew; Jakalláni call that “eating like an Ahoggyá.”

Where Khirgár is militaristic and rather stiff, and Tumíssa is intellectual, Jakalla is pleasure-oriented and lax. Many social strictures are eased in Jakálla; bribery and trafficking in favors are a way of life. In Jakálla, you can buy anybody or anything.

The decadent Jakalláni go in for music, dance, mime, jugglers, alcohol, drugs, and street parties in a big way. Jakallani also have a more relaxed attitude toward morality than most Tsolyani. You will see things in public here that would not even be whispered of in private in, say, Khirgár.

This relaxation of strictures, however, has also created a renaissance of literature and the arts in Jakálla. From a social and intellectual point of view, Jakálla is the place to be. Filled with schools, with poetry symposia, with both genuine and aspiring artists and writers, Jakálla is unequalled within Tsolyánu as a home for the intellectual elite. The average Jakalláni on the street knows more of poetry and literature than the upper-class citizens of more work-oriented cities.

## Clothing and Ornamentation

For starters, Jakálla is one of the hottest (and sometimes most humid) cities of the Empire. Combined with the noted Jakalláni attitude toward sex and pleasure, Jakálla has become one of the barest cities of the Empire as well. Dress in Jakálla is a lot looser, more nude than up north. As elsewhere, the laboring classes in Jakálla have always gone pretty well naked; the question is a more interesting one as applied to the higher classes.

## Daily Wear

Jakalláni women may wear nothing more than a strip of cloth around their hair ro keep it out of their eyes —for ornamentation and convenience, not for cover. More elaborately, perhaps a dab of ribbon and a few pieces of jewelry with their clan symbols and any relevant symbols of rank. Earrings, necklaces, and pins are good.

Men, too, often walk around stark naked, or with nothing more than a mantle to protect them from the brutal sun. higher-status men may wear a elaborate headdress, fancy jewelled collar, and a little kilt of firya-cloth. Clan symbols go around the neck, on a belt buckle, or on a mantle —perhaps on a tabard down the front of thier kilt, if they wear a kilt.

Older people of either gender tend not to go as nude; maybe a fancy vest of fírya and a not really wrap-around kilt, sometimes with pleats sown in.

Both sexes may wear religious symbols for aspects of divinities they particularly like, often as jewelry of some sort. You’ll see a lot more tiny precious-stone phalluses of Hríhayal around, for example, even among Jakalláni who aren’t primarily worshippers of the deity; it may just mean they enjoy a good time. Active-duty legion personnel wear a legion symbol, but only if they are in uniform.

## Party Clothes

Party dress in Jakálla is usually not completely nude, because it shows status to wear something elaborate and expensive, but in good taste. It will, however, almost always be thin —thésun-gauze or fírya, with exotic dyes and colors, covering a variety of parts of the body as needed to make things interesting. The headdress is often more important than the clothing; you can wear your clan symbols on it or on your tunic.

The clothing issue, especially at parties, is complicated by the fact that there are so many styles and protocols to keep track of. If you go to an Imperial party, for example, you have to worry about forms. If you go to a high clan party, some idiot will have decided to wear Form 4—very recognizable, almost like it has a number on it—and the other guests will be laughing at him behind his back because, don’t y’know, that just isn’t appropriate for a party at Sea Blue this season. To further complicate matters, high-status Jakállani will often stretch the bounds of the forms and protocols to fit their whims.

## Military Dress

Standard military uniforms in Jakálla for both sexes consist of a kilt, a tunic, and light boots in the appropriate Legion colors. They generally do not wear the armor except in emergencies, as it is far too hot. If a legion soldier or officer goes to a fancy party where status is important, they can wear an “undress” uniform including light gilded or painted chlén-hide armor to show their status. They can add a clan color, and/or god symbol, to that; officers generally do.. usu officers wear that. Legion dress uniform itself involves actual armor, and is generally avoided in Jakálla outside of certain official ceremonies.

Cuisine

Jakalláni chefs present diners with dishes both subtle and dramatic, using spices and fragrances to create a feast for all the senses. One can generally characterize Jakállan cuisine as spicy and sweet, making use of hlíng-seed and an array of exotic flavorings, some brought directly to Jakálla’s docks by ships from far lands. Though true connoiseurs know that Jakálla’s cuisine differs from neighborhood to neighborhood — food in Músa Jakálla is hotter than in Pála Jakálla, for example — there is certainly enough in common to talk about “Jakalláni Cuisine” as a unit.

Jakalláni cooking involves a variety of elaborate cooking techniques (as for example in Lonmá, where partly done meat is removed from the stew, wrapped in gold leaf, and then returned to finish cooking), as well as a much wider range of ingredients than most Tsolyáni regional cuisines. Jakalláni meals are often served with a wide variety of outliandish condiments so the diner can experiment and discover new sensations for him- or herself.

Perhaps the most remarked aspect of Jakalláni cuisine is that chefs pay special attention to the fragrance of many dishes, adding floral and herbal essences to produce tantalizing, haunting odors. These powerful essences — sometimes only one drop in a stew is needed — are almost all manufactured in Pála or Músa Jakálla and sold in special shops. You can get them in other cities as well, but there they market them, as well they should, as “Fragrances of Jakálla.”

There is a general saying about Jakálla that applies perfectly to our cuisine — love it or hate it, you will never forget it. Newcomers to Jakálla sometimes find our dishes too spicy for their taste, or too rich, or confusing; in contrast to Jakalláni cooking, most Tsolyáni food is bland and uninteresting. With exposure, discerning visitors learn to appreciate our cuisine, which is, after all, the product of some 20,000 years of culinary experimentation. Pity Jakalláni forced to live elsewhere in the Empire, pining away for a taste of Tekhá or Mehldoá!

## Beverages

It is fitting that we begin our culinary exploration of Jakálla, city of decadent pleasures, with a listing of some of the city’s most characteristic alcoholic beverages. Though recreational drugs are popular in Jakálla, alcohol, too has its place.

**Dedén** —a powerful rum-like drink made from burnt Dmí-sugar and other ingredients (the vintner clans won't reveal what they are exactly, which may be just as well). Dedén is brownish in colour, thick, and very intoxicating. It is drunk by people who think of themselves as “warriors:” followers of Vimuhla, Karakan, and their Cohorts. It costs about 1.5 Káitars per bottle, and that will usually be enough to turn 3-4 imbibers into Kurukú (little chattering beasts; cf. The Tekumel Bestiary).

**Onúsa** — thick, syrupy Másh-fruit brandy, into which the juice of sour unripe Dlél-fruit is squeezed to give it “strength.” Mixed with water, this makes a cool and tasty summer drink. The priestesses of Dlamélish and Hríhayal mix one of their “blue powders” into it to give it an aphrodisiac quality that is said to be powerful enough to “raise the manhood of a stone statue.” About 5 Qírgals a cup (about the size of an American coffee mug). The “powders” are extra: a Hlásh or two more.

## Desserts

As one might expect, it is in the area of desserts where Jakalláni chefs truly push the limits of their decadent expertise. We are only describing two of the most traditional Jakalláni desserts here, but rest assured that any banquet in Jakálla will have fancies the likes of which you had never contemplated.

**Mehldoá** —thick fruit pudding, made like a custard and served hot as a dessert. It is filled with whatever fruit is in season, although Dlél-fruit predominates. Other fruits are also used, as are berries and sweet “sea-grapes” (actually a species of life-form rather like a sea urchin that is found on the beaches along the southern coasts).

Mehldoá is not usually made by the food-preparation clans but rather by the fisherfolk of the Green Stone clan in the little villages that lie along the coasts east of Jakálla. It costs about 2 Hlash per "bucket" (largish earthenware pot, serving 4-6). This is specifically a Jakalláni dish and is not made elsewhere — though Jakalláni consider mehldoá to be a wonderful remedy for stomach distress, many “inlanders” complain that it makes them ill.

**Neninél** — the ultimate Dlamélish/Hríhayal sweet dessert, made from the translucent, greenish flesh of the Nél fruit, which only grows in the Flats of Tsechélnu, west of Jakálla. These fruits are peeled, sliced thin, and layered with perfumed Dmí-sugar over fine pastry. Spices and “powders” are then put over this, or between the layers, to provide temporary “highs” that can be enjoyable, though too exciting for older folks.

The best Neninél is prepared at the House of the Pleasant Hour in Jakálla itself. It also figures in certain rituals of the Inner Temple of Lady Dlamélish. The worshippers of Hríhayal also love it and mix it with one of their special powders that deadens pain and enhances wild passion and lust. Older and more conservative persons are careful to peek between the layers before tasting it!

Neninél costs about 10 Qírgal per serving without the powders —and about 2-5 Káitars per serving with some real headliners! It is also made into “candy” and shipped in special little wooden chests all around Tékumel. It retains its greenish, translucent hue (looking rather like a green gumdrop), but Jakalláni connoiseurs are never satisfied unless they have the fresh stuff.

## Main Courses

Despite their love of drugs, alcohol, and desserts, far be it from the Jakalláni to neglect other pleasures of the meal. Jakalláni main dishes are spicy, aromatic, delicious — and an adventure for those who are new to the city.

**Lonmá** —a very rich and expensive stew, made with the best Hmélu meat, rare spices, and certain hard-to-find vegetables that cost up to a Káitar each (rather like truffles). There are only two food-preparation clans in Jakálla that really know how to make this — the local clanhouses of the Flowering Life and Green Opal clans. The pieces of meat are removed, wrapped in gold-leaf so thin that it will be eaten along with the food, and then returned to the stew. (Gold-leaf does not harm the digestion; Jakalláni believe it is good for it!) Lonmá is eaten with refined “pure-red” Dná-grain bread and maschín, a sort of whitish butter made of Hmélu or Hmá milk.

The dish is so rich and heavy that a sharply acidic, watery, white wine is served right after it in order to “cleanse the mouth and the stomach.” Lonmá cannot be had without an advance order, and it costs perhaps 5 Káitars per serving. Only the richer banquets ever provide it.

**Maridzó** — a savoury meat or seafood stew, made with Ngála-grape raisins, Dmí-sugar, bits of fish or Hmélu browned and baked, various vegetables, and lots of different spices. It might remind you of Spanish paella, but this is hotter and sweeter. Maridzó is an expensive dish, costing a Káitar or two per pot (serves four) —cheaper can be had, but so can food-poisoning!

**Rettúna** — fried Yáfa-rice, mixed with shredded meat or fish, steamed in a pot and sprinkled with petals of the bright red Yelél flower; these have a powerful, pungent, sweet-spicy taste. Rettúna is eaten with flat, unleavened Dná-grain bread and accompanied by thin, vinegary local wine. This is a particular favourite of the Karakán/Chegárra clans. It is eaten in Khírgar also, but there they leave off the flower petals. They also do not make it as hot-spicy. In Jakálla this costs about 10 Hlásh per pot.

**Tekhá fish** — this white-fleshed fish is a river fish, and to outsiders it is said to taste like mud. It is filleted and breaded, then fried in spices and oil. The Jakalláni love it and say that “one who does not eat Tekhá in the month of Dohála cannot be from Jakalla.” Of course, there are certain groups that eat no fish at all, but they either eat Tekhá clandestinely or else are forgiven for not eating it! A Hlásh or so per fish (which serves two).

## Street Foods

Jakálla has a well-developed culture of street vendors, and even upper-class Jakalláni will venture into a slightly seedy neighborhood (with an escort, of course!) to enjoy a favorite dish from a favorite vendor whose family has sold it at the same spot for some 2,000 years (probably to their ancestors!). Though trends in street cuisine come and go like other cultural fads, some items are staples on the Jakalláni scene. Here are a few of the most traditional Jakalláni street foods:

**Alél** —thin slices of Hmélu meat smeared with spices and Hlíng-seed paste, then wrapped in Gapúl leaves and baked in the ashes of a slow fire. Very spicy and not much liked by those who prefer mild cuisine! This is cheap: 10 Qírgals or so per slice in the market. The food-preparation clans do a better job and charge up to a Hlásh per serving; they also deliver to your clanhouse.

**Áng** — a marketplace staple; slices of Hmelu meat tenderised with Moró root and stir-fried on an open brazier. Not made by the better food-preparation clans; you can only get it in the market. A serving costs 5-10 Qírgals.

**Mélmel** (some accent the second "e")— fried Dná-grain kernels mixed with salt and hot spices. This is served in little paper cones at the Hirilákte Arena and serves as a sort of “Tsolyáni popcorn.” Some vendors insert a few tiny metal statues, coins, and other “favors” into the mix for the children. About 2 Qírgals per paper cone.

**Mrügé** —dried, spiced Hmélu or even Tsi'íl meat (softer than jerky). This is not precisely a street-vendor food — it is carried by travellers and is eaten by laborers in the fields since it is said to impart energy — but it is sold by vendors from carts and in the marketplace. It looks awful (long, blackish stringy, greasy pieces) but it tastes good and is nutritious. Costs about a Hlásh per “bunch” (feeds one or two).

## Music

### Órodai hi Takólu

93 years old, thin, wispy, wrinkled and stooped, but still sings beautifully. The most famous of the epic singers of Jakálla, his most famous piece is the "Lament to the Wheel of Black," in the Engsvanyáli recension. He rarely travels now, but still appears at Jakállan feasts. He charges very heavily (5-10,000 Káitars per appearance), but his presence can truly make an occasion. Much of his time, now, is spent in training younger singers, some of whom command respect and high fees in their own right. Órodai has four much younger wives, uncountable children, grandchildren, etc.

## Holidays

Every city in the Empire has its own festivals and holidays, sometimes commemorating historical events special to that city, other times simply festivals sacred to the city’s primary deity or deities. Jakálla, beloved of Lady Dlamelish, seeker of pleasure, is no exception.

We have listed here the major holidays honored in Jakálla; there are of course hundreds sacred to specific temples. If you are fortunate enough to be visiting Jakalla during one of these holidays, rejoice and take part; throw yourself into merrymaking with a will, for that is the Jakalláni way — and as we Jakalláni will be doing so, you won’t accomplish anything else until the holiday is past!

If you can manage to be in Jakálla during the Intercalary days, you are especially fortunate; we celebrate festivals on four of the five days, culminating in the joyous public carnival on Chitlasha, the Masque of the Old and the New Year. Though other cities hold such carnivals, none can approach that held in Jakálla, the Mistress of the Empire!

**1st Hasanpór — New Year’s Day**

Celebrated throughout the Five Empires, this is a day of feasts, gift-giving, pageants, and parades. Perhaps nowhere is it so grand as in Jakálla, ....

**3rd Langála — Summer Solstice**

Another national holiday, honored with rich feasts and much merry-making.

**2nd Drénggar — The Unveiling of Beauty**

Sacred to the Goddess Hriháyal, cohort to Jakálla’s patroness Lady Dlamelish, this festival is publicly celebrated only in Jakalla. It is commemorated with spectacular rituals and wonderfully debauched orgies. Many of these celebrations are open to worshippers of other deities who wish to participate.

**9th Drénggar — The Enhancement of the Emerald Radience**

Following close on the heels of the Unveiling of Beauty, the Festival of the Enhancement of the Emerald Radience is celebrated throughout Tsolyánu — but nowhere else is it as grand as in Jakálla, Lady Dlamélish’s very own city.

With a whole week to recover in between, Jakalláni throw themselves into this festival witha will, honoring it with elaborate feasts, more rituals, and more orgies. Again, public participation is welcome. Not to be missed.

**9th Lésdrim — The Birthday of the Seal Emperor**

Commemorated with processions, as well as military parades and drills by Jakálla’s own legions: the Legion of Girikteshmu (23rd Imperial Archers), the Legion of Mengano the Jakallan (12th Imperial Artillery), the Squadrons of Tlaneno the Steersman (3rd Imperial Marines), and The Legion of Guruggma (3rd Imperial Ahoggya Auxiliary Heavy Infantry). Be sure to see the Fleet pageants as well.

**10th Dohála — The Accession of the Seal Emperor to the Petal Throne**

Celebrated, as throughout Tsolyánu (but with that unique Jakállani touch!) with feasts, Imperial pageantry, and parties.

**Ikáner — Entering in unto the Goddess**

Sacred to Lady Dlamelish, and celebrated with rituals and orgies.

**Vraháma — The Celebration of Splendid Victories**

Rare for a Jakállan holiday, in that it is dedicated to warlike Lord Karakán, this festival is commemorated with military pageants at the various Legion barracks and at the Temple of Karakán.

**Ngaqómi — The Feast of the Many-Colored Lanterns**

Sacred to Lady Hrihayal, but celebrated throughout the city with feasts and orgies.

**Chitlásha — The Masque of the Old and the New Year**

Celebrated with public carnivals.

ALBERTI A GOOD SOURCE -- ADD HOLIDAYS FROM MITLANYAL

Wwinter solst celebrated too. by going otu and hoding a large outdoor party up and dn the trseet. sometimes ends up in riots; drunken parties. still class-based. if noble, unless stoned out of your mind, wont wind up in low class -- prob in own clan, big kegs of stuff for the local hangers-on in the neighborhood. neighb paternalistsic -- goog clanhses surrounded by lower-class hses. if a poor person from a lowerclass clan comes to upperclass clan for help, they’ll prob give it to him. (pretend it’s a loan) the clans take care of these lower-class supporters, hangers-on, around them. mAY be 5 or 6 uc clanhses in the neighborhood, and kick in on it together.

high cl;an folks will maybe come out and watch for a while from the roof; may go back and forth between the hses visting relatives.

tsolyani know well the principle bread and circuses -- parties, plus hirilakte arena open to the lower classes for a very small fee. high clans have separate areas, as do the temples. once in a while, there will be a group of soldiers who o together, but not w the officers.

jakalla food riots -- every summer, in firasul. so hto and dry that the river dries up somewhat, water brought over teh mudflats from dstant areas, canals dry up, water is nasty. hoigh clans sometimes have wells to supply them with decent water. may be a drought, food isn’t coming in by cart, it’s expensive, transposrt clans quarreling. as prices go up, the poor people can’t afford it. something triggers it. summer heat is so uncomfrtable that people get angry and touchy.

lower classes are less concerned about insult; they kid with each other.

you can say things that indicate your opinions, but you cannot say them bluntly.

Glad you enjoyed the descriptions of Jakallani food. I wish i could describe the essences in meaningful terms, but to say "sort of like rose, mixed with strawberries, mixed with peppermint" doesn't tell you much. There are dozens of essences used in cooking anyway, and each cook has his/her own proportions and ideas.

There is very little accurate measurement of ingredients. Everybody uses a "pinch" of this and a "handful" of that. Each cook's dishes are thus different. There are also minor variations from one neighbourhood of Jakalla to another, although these can be overlooked. Musa Jakalla makes hotter food than Pala Jakalla, etc.
