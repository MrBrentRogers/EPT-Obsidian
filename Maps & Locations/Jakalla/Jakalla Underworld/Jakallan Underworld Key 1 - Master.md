| 1     | Bright Blue  | 28   | Three bays contain images of the forms of Durritlámish: first is made of common red stone; second is carnelian (worth 700), and third is solid ruby (worth 7,000).

In the diamond shaped passage there is a juggernaut car which rolls endlessly round and round at 12" per turn.  It crushes anything in its path except a real barrier (stone, magic iron, etc.).  The door to the entrance corridor locks automatically and opens again only on a roll of one as explorers pass it.  Items thrown down will be crushed.  Inside the chamber is a steatite sarcophagus, with three Ru'ún guards.  Inside the sarcophagus there is an inner coffin of gold and gems worth 60,000.  The mummy inside this is robed in gems worth 75,000.  Here there is an unmarked switch which shuts off the juggernaut car.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

They may speak to party (30 percent chance) or just whisper and plead.  In the centre of this room is Nyélmu's Gem of Contacting: it has 7 charges left, and it has gradated chances of success: Level 1-3 = 10 percent; Level 4-6 = 20 percent; Level 7-9 = 30 percent chance; Level 10-up has 40 percent chance.  Gem itself is worth 10,000.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| 3     | Green        | 44   | Chamber of punishments.  Here is where Nyélmu produces his "statues" by irreversible magic.  Here his android torturers have all their implements in the three small rooms, and here is the Eye of the Stone Gaze (not on table) which turns anyone of any level to stone unless saving throw is made.  It has 68 charges, ins. in Pecháni, Ind.).  Only this Eye can reverse the damage done by the torturers and the turning to stone.  But rescued beings simply fall to dust.  This dust can be revived by a revivification spell or Eye of Bestowing Life.  Androids here are also warriors and fight with maces, whips, etc.  They have AC 3 and HD 5.

If completely slain, a casket rises from the pool and frees Lirené, priestess of Avánthe, held in bondage for eons.  She is 9th Level, has several bonus spells (roll for which), and will stay with party for ten turns, after which she hears a call from beyond the grave and slowly fades away through the nearest wall.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| 3     | Red          | 46   | This room contains the Singer of Doom, Lelmiyáni.  This sweet-looking little girl has a small flute.  If she wins initiative, she plays it, requiring all to throw saving throws: Levels 1-3 need 18, Levels 4-6 need 16, Levels 7-9 need 15, anything beyond this needs only 11.  She then hypnotizes party and leads them (not being able to map) through passageways to Garden of the Weeping Snows (cf. 100).  She is automaton and is AC 1, HD 5.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

This garden, he says, is full of blooms which bring madness and a lingering death.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| 3     | Red          | 62   | Altar swings open from 60 to reveal inner shrine of Marággu, where she herself sits upon a dais.  She stands 12 feet tall and looks like her picture (cf. room 54 above).  She is AC1 and HD 10 (50 points).  She offers party wine from her chalice -- poison.  She then offers them food (pointed tiny slivers in it are deadly unless saving throw of 13 rolled).  If attacked, she uses her wand, which is like Doom-Kill and creates an explosion.  It does 2 12-sided dice damage and can be fired at anything outside of one's ten feet radius with no harm to user.  It has only 10 charges, but may be recharged by thoroughly useful Eye.  She also has a dagger +3H +3D.  If reduced to 1-3 hit points, she disappears.  Beneath her dais there is a long, flat chest which contains 10 gems (100, 100, 100, 500, 100, 50, 500, 100, 100, 500), and 5 pieces of jewellery (5000, 4000, 800, 6000, 60,000).  There is also the Music Box of Nekkutháne (#16, misc.).  The chest has three traps; lock has poison spines which fly out at player cutting it open (saving throw of 12); inside, the gems are accursed and require a saving throw against spells from the player first picking up their pouch; the Music Box is covered with poisonous dust, and another saving throw against poison is needed. |

| 3     | Red          | 100  | Bronze doors open outwards onto Garden of the Weeping Snows.  Before these gates are two monstrously carven sphinxes.  Garden contains plants which have fluffy white down which drips from boughs as though it were "weeping." It is narcotic and puts any level of character to sleep for 3 turns.  If party stays on the paths, it does not bother them; otherwise they must roll saving throws of 14 each.  Garden is full of statues of terrible scenes of torture.  The 69 ways of unhappy demise.  Each scene consists of a human, some men and some women, depicted in agony upon some sort of torture device, with torturers in attendance.  These beings cannot be brought back to life.  Roll for gold and gems on each one examined; roll of 0-50 = nothing; 51-70 = one gem; 71-90 = 1 piece of jewellery; 91-100 = misc. weapon (roll for which).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
