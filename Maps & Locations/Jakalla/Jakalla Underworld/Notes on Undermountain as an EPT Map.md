Origins (VII): Changing the Maps. Though The Ruins of Undermountains offers the nearest thing to a look at a primordial megadungeon of anything that TSR ever published … it's turns out that it's still somewhat distant. That's in large part because TSR didn't actually use Ed Greenwood's original maps. Greenwood says that The Ruins of Undermountain uses the "original keys to the area around the shaft down from the Yawning Portal", but that the rest of the maps are actually "an old Empire of the Petal Throne home-campaign map that the late Dave Sutherland … had lying around". Apparently TSR didn't want to spend the time redrawing Greenwood's faded maps with their "cramped, tiny, wandering-all-over-the-pages keys". You can see the differences between the two styles of mapin printed product when you look at the smaller rooms around the Yawning Portal entrance and compare that to the larger rooms everywhere else — though those larger rooms were sometimes broken up by Ed Greenwood, Steven Schend, and other TSR staff to make them more reasonable!
