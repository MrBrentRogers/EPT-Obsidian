**Golden Bough Clan**

Mókorun hiChaishyáni – Hnálla worshiper, Clan Master of the Golden Bough Clan in Thráya. 51 years old, he is charismatic, likeable, and affable. Already plump and continuing to grow, with his curly hair, he’s often called “Hma” behind his back, which he usually thinks is funny. Shrewd, he sees and hears everything, tends to talk less and listen more, and remembers all that he sees and hears, making him an excellent negotiator. While he is an able administrator and businessman, he is not a very good diplomat and often awkward in non-business social situations, so he leaves all of the social doings of the clan to the Clan Matriarch.

Há’is hiQolsúna – Avánthe worshiper, Clan Matriarch of the Golden Bough Clan in Thráya. 62 years old, Há’is has a full head of long grey hair, and sharp eyes that miss nothing. Despite her years she is still good looking and quite spry, often seen in the clan courtyard exercising with those much younger. While not at all interested in financial dealings, she is in charge of all social aspects of the clan, a duty that she exercises with great ability. A shrewd diplomat and supremely skilled at the social graces, she is well known for her ability to get what she wants out of people, often without their knowing that she has subtly manipulated them.

Arákan – Thúmis worshiper, Major Domo of the Golden Bough Clan in Thráya. 46 years old, he is physically huge and very strong, yet outgoing and jolly, possessed of much charm and vitality, and loves good wine and good food. He is neat and always clean and impeccably dressed. He is intensely loyal to the clan and always knows what is happening about the clan house, which he runs like a well-oiled machine.

Húgesh hiZhnáyu – Ksárul worshiper, Clan Elder on the Clan Council of the Golden Bough Clan. Age 53, he is very friendly, outgoing, kindly fellow of no particular professional distinction. One of the city’s great numismatists; if his collection is not the biggest or richest it is at least the most public and easiest to view.

Wachánu hiMrékka – Qón worshiper, Golden Bough Clan, Chief Astronomer at "The Garden of Ártekh," outdoor astronomical "park". 54 years old, Aknállu is pleasant, ruddy cheeked, small, and unprepossessing. His skills as a mathematician, astronomer and astrologer are widely known, and he is also well read in matters of dogma and ritual in the temple of Qón.

Chéleth hiTéshku, Belkhánu worshiper, Clan Elder on the Clan Council of the Golden Bough Clan is a hale man of 55, who has an affectation of keeping his greying hair long and pulled back. He has a round pleasant face, and keeps himself very physically fit. He is known as a good swordsman and teaches younger members of the clan swordplay. Also known for his arms and armor collection, some of which dates back to the Lliyáni period.

Hémesh hiTéshku, Belkhánu worshiper, Chéleth’s son, a master merchant of the Golden Bough Clan. Hémesh is 32 years old, average height, and physically fit (he is a good swordsman like his father). He has a friendly open face and the personality to match. He is a shrewd businessman, however, and knows the Golden Bough Clan’s import/export business inside and out. He travels the Empire and to neighboring Salarvyá on clan business, setting up trade deals for the clan.

Murésh hiQoyélmu, Hnálla worshiper, Golden Bough clan, Commandant of the Omnipotent Azure Legion in Béy Sǘ, is just now entering his middle years. He is of squarish build and possesses the typical features of a Tsolyáni of the central Empire (he’s originally from Thráya). He passed under the Jade Arch only upon retiring from the military arm of the Legion, where he served with skill and distinction, but his rapid rise and promotions over more senior officials to his current post is easy to understand as he is a skilled administrator and born leader. His position is second only to the Princeps of the Omnipotent Azure Legion in Avanthár. Murésh has one wife, also from the Golden Bough clan, and a young son.

Qorúma hiQoyélmu, Hnálla worshiper, Golden Bough clan, Clan Elder on the Clan Council of the Golden Bough Clan, elder brother of Murésh and father of Chanésh. Qorúma is 56, and has kept himself fairly fit for his age, though he has acquired a bit of a paunch and a slight limp from a wound he received while on a mission for the OAL. He has greying hair and sharp eyes that don’t miss anything. Qorúma is a former officer in the OAL, but has been retired now for several years. He has taken up his passion of poetry and his poems have received a bit of renown locally. He is the older brother of Murésh.

Chanésh hiQoyélmu, Hnálla worshiper, Golden Bough clan, Kási and head of the OAL Military contingent in Thráya, nephew of Murésh, son of Qorúma. Chanésh is 32 and an up and coming person in Thráya. He is extremely handsome, tall and well-muscled with a friendly face and aquiline nose. He was stationed in Béy Sǘ during the civil war fought with Princes Taksúru and Rereshqála there and acquitted himself extremely well. Married to Ka’ásha vuMirigidáme, daughter of Úsha vuMirigidáme, the Governor of Thráya.

Dinó hiCrocétti, a worshiper of Thúmis, Golden Bough clan, tall, suave, and handsome, Dinó is a playboy, and is a hit among the ladies. He is often seen singing something (which he is quite good at), but is not very good at fighting (which he needs to do fairly often due to his many trysts). Partnered with Jérome on temple business.

Mírigdan hiZhnáyu, administrative priest of Hrü’ú, Golden Bough clan. Mírigdan is 45, bald and has grown fat in his cushy job at the temple. He is very shrewd, however, and has risen to a position of some prominence in the temple.

**Thráya Government – Imperial Locals**

Úsha vuMirigidáme – Avánthe, Joyous of Vrá, 43 years old, Governor of Thráya, 73 comeliness, 70 charisma, slender, tall, rather ominous looking (hawk-like face with sharp features), looks cruel but in actually is very pleasant. She has two husbands, and several children. Patroness of the “Palace and Library”.

Jijékmu hiTánkolel, Great Stone clan, priest of Ksárul; tall, thin his hair is shorter than is in current fashion, he is a competent administrator, came from the temple hierarchy and is skilled in administration of lands and tithes, a solid likable guy. Husband of Úsha.

Gáyan hiCheshkósa, worshiper of Chegárra, Rising Sun Clan, Molkar in The Cohorts of Chegárra, the Hero King, (12 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) Imperial Medium Infantry); he is of medium build, bluff and very muscular, like Úsha he projects an ominous air but is really affable and approachable). Husband of Úsha.

Ka’ásha vuMirigidáme, Avánthe worshiper, Joyous of Vrá clan, daughter of Úsha and Gáyan. She is lovely, with long hair which she keeps up in elaborate hairdos and a heart-shaped face. She is an accomplished musician and a patroness of the academy of Jogái (the 31 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) aspect of Avánthe “The Songstress”) in Thráya. She is married to Chanésh hiQoyélmu of the Golden Bough clan.

Mrikél hiVarshá – Qón worshiper, Golden Bough Clan, Lieutenant Governor of Thráya. 29 years old, very intelligent and cunning, self-consciously good-looking and fashionable, affable and sociable he chaffs a bit at being second to Úsha (as the Golden Bough were the traditional Governors of Thráya), but is hoping to be appointed Governor when she retires or is reassigned.

Káyeq hiPalumítlo – Keténgku worshiper, Rising Sun Clan, Adjutant to the Governor. 26 years old, she is pretty in a long-legged, coltish way, with hip-length wavy hair and-a widow's peak. She has always been somewhat of a tomboy and is highly trained in armed martial art. She excelled as a student of administration and languages in the temple academy and is quite suited for her position as Adjutant to the Governor. She has an eventual interest in marriage, and she has had lovers, but she is not involved with anyone at present.

Kiriktákte hiVirítle – Vimúhla worshiper, Red Stone clan, Captain of the Palace Guard. 26 years old, tall, square-jawed, good-looking and athletic with short-cropped blue-black hair, he is an excellent warrior, a stern disciplinarian, a clever politician, and a man much given to sudden rages and whimsical kindnesses.

Háia hiKirutlár – Chiténg worshiper, First Moon clan, Commander of the City Watch. She is 37 years old, heavy for a woman, muscular, and tough and a veteran of the war in Yán Kór. She is not pretty but is well-liked and cheerful, but is rather shy and clumsy when it comes to the opposite sex. She does not drink or gamble, having once lost all her pay to a gang of soldiers from Chené Hó while on campaign.

Choís hiVraisánu – Hnálla worshiper, Golden Dawn clan, Major Domo of the Governor’s palace. 48 years old, he has a small and delicate head joining a sloping chest with little pause for shoulders, and a rotund pot-belly overhanging his rounded, almost feminine hips in testimony to his love of sedentary habits – and of good food. An able administrator, he has served in the Palace under three governors. Rumored to perhaps overcharge vendors and put a bit aside for himself, however.

Shasá hiDíridan, Hnálla worshiper, Golden Bough Clan, Dowager Empress of Tsolyánu. Shasá is a sprightly 71 years old. She has long white hair that she keeps up in an attractive hairdo that frames her lovely round face, and sparkling eyes that miss nothing. While short she moves with grace and poise that belies her age. She is also still quite active and keeps fit by working out with each day with a quarterstaff master. She is an accomplished artist, and her paintings and needlecraft grace the palace. She has surrounded herself with musicians, poets and other masters of the fine arts.

Shasá lives in a palace hidden in its own mini-Béthorm, the entrance of which is somewhere on the Sákbe Road between Thráya and Jakálla. Only someone who knows exactly where the entrance is and how to get into it can enter, and only by invitation or with an appropriate token issued by the OAL. The palace grounds are small but immaculately groomed gardens, with plants from across the five empires. There are walking paths, pools with small decorative fish and quiet places for contemplation. The palace itself is modest, by Imperial standards, with exquisite but simple furnishings and decorations. It has a small staff of servants, just enough to keep the Dowager Empress comfortable.

**Palace of the Priesthoods of the Gods**

Mírshan hiSsánkoral – Amber Cloak Clan, Belkhánu Worshiper. Prefect of the Palace of the Priesthoods of the Gods. 47 he is somewhat short and on the heavy side, but is faultlessly cultured, though he does not make an undue effort to conform to Tsolyáni high society. He tends to be officious, but is still approachable.

Árun hiKarélsa – Grugánu worshiper, Black Stone Clan, Chief Scribe of the Palace of the Priesthoods of the Gods. 42 years old, he is thin to the point of emaciation, bald, with the typical central-Tsolyáni hooked nose and sharp chin. His interests include philosophy, several of the sciences, and art, and he served at the Palace of the Priesthoods of the Gods with distinction for the past five years.

Élulen hiBéyilto – Dlamélish worshiper, Green Kirtle Clan, Chief Clerk of Ecclesiastic Lands and Titles. 34 years old, her face is round, fine-boned and small-chinned, with high cheekbones, sensuous lips and long eyes made even longer by the artful application of black Tsúnu-paste. She is voluptuously curved, and many dismiss her due to her looks, but she has an amazing memory for detail and is an able administrator and is highly valued at the Palace of the Priesthoods of the Gods.

Tíkkune hiVólkulsal– Thúmis Worshiper, Scroll of Wisdom Clan, Chief Canon Justice. 35 years old, he is extremely handsome, with curling locks, a flashing smile, and a rakish look that excites the young men he has had as lovers. Very intelligent, perceptive and thoughtful, and extremely scholarly and learned for a man of his age, he is often though hard to approach, yet quite outgoing to his friends and cronies. He is unmarried.

**Palace of the Realm**

Hóru hiÍto – Ito clan, Moderate Sárku worshiper, 35 years old pleasant looking, but not handsome. Prefect of the Palace of the Realm. Not really into politics but fascinating conversationalist and patron of the arts.

Fashránu hiOróso – Durritlámish worshiper, Dark Flame clan, Commander of the Tomb Police. Now 42, he is an intensely, serious man of great charisma who conveys the imminence of Durritlámish by his simple presence. He is assisted in this by a rare skin condition that has left blotchy areas of black and brown on his face, producing the illusion of decay.

Sikún hiHehésha – Thúmis worshiper, Grey Cloak clan, Chief Administrator of Public Works. 40 years old and not handsome or a particularly charismatic public speaker, but genial, diplomatic, and well-liked. He has lavish tastes and believes very strongly in doing things on a large scale, in the grandest way that resources permit – limited only by boundaries of Imperial protocol. This makes him suited for his position in Public Works, but there are times when the Governor and/or the Prefect of the Palace of the Realm needs to bring him back to reality when budgeting for his grand plans.

Vorússa hiÓbra – Drá worshiper, Ensorcelled Goblet clan, Chief Registrar of Titles and Lands. 39 years old and slender as a new sapling, fine-boned, with the axe-edged features of eastern Tsolyánu and the indefinable air of the far traveller about him. He has only been in his position for two years and will probably not stay for long, as he tends to hop from one city to another as he grows bored with a given position. Because of this he isn’t really all that well versed in the intricacies of his bureau.

Argóme hiArusá – Vimúhla worshiper, Black Stone clan, Battalion Chief of the Sákbe Road Guards. 33 years old, frankly of only average intelligence and capabilities, but handsome and moderately wealthy. He is somewhat prickly and paranoid – not unjustifiably so, given the schemes and intrigues within the Flame Temples. Doctrinal and political blandness combined with his family’s money, however, have permitted him to rise to his current position.

Zhána hiDlekutú – Hnálla worshiper, White Crystal clan, Chief Justice of Thráya. Age 47, bony and tall, and still somewhat good-looking but of an austere mien. A brilliant legal mind, but she can be stiff in public away from the courts, and often seems withdrawn, but in actuality is usually deep in contemplation: more a deep than a fast thinker, but once her mind is made up she is firm and ruthless in her judgments.

Kútume hiSayúncha – Karakán worshiper, Golden Sunburst Clan, Section Chief, Omnipotent Azure Legion. Age 51, stout and balding (although he combs his hair to cover it), a man of solemn mien and somber dignity. He rarely smiles, but in spite of the sometimes unpleasant nature of his position, he is not a cruel or sadistic man.

Chanésh hiQoyélmu, Hnálla worshiper, Golden Bough clan, Kási and head of the OAL Military contingent in Thráya.

Okurél hiChúreshma – Ksárul worshiper, Black Mountain Clan, Chief Tax Collector. Age 56, he is a thickset, smallish man, of no great strength but yet possessing considerable vitality. In his youth he took a great interest in women, and at one time he had some twelve wives and many concubines. His last wife died about a year or so ago, however, and he is now alone, totally devoted to his administration – and to a brood of grandchildren who are mostly teenagers now. He is interested in Daqú, and in poetry, although in his youth he was quite athletic and a powerful wrestler.

Tlássa hiTekkéngsa – Keténgku worshiper; Staff of Beneficence Clan, Chief Administrator of Public Health. Age 52, a deeply experienced physician and apothecary, he is best known as a mercurial bully who frequently explodes in violent rages at his people, then spends endless amounts of time trying to set things right.

**Palace of Ever Glorious War**

Burasháya hiKáikune – Chegárra; Red Sword Clan, 47 years old, Prefect of the Palace of Ever Glorious War. An intelligent and solid man. Big, strong, physically impressive, almost no neck, has trouble finding cloths that fit. Large dome-shaped head (hard to fit his helmet). Very devoted to Chegárra and to the ideals of personal honor, personal dignity and so forth, an experienced mountain fighter and a soldier of the utmost discipline and toughness.

Elúsa hiTakán – Chegárra; Blade Raised High Clan, 44 years old, Kérdu of The Cohorts of Chegárra, the Hero King, 12 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) Imperial Medium Infantry. A demanding, sometimes bullying, no-nonsense career soldier, she is an excellent leader and officer. An infamous religious fanatic in her youth, she seems to have lost her interest in religious matters or her sense of devotion over the past few years, and has been reprimanded repeatedly by her peers and superiors in the legion and the temple.

Sherésa hiDísonu – Chegárra; Standing Stone Clan, 36 years old, Senior Dritlán of The Cohorts of Chegárra, the Hero King, 12 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) Imperial Medium Infantry. She is 34 years old, a fierce, clever officer, tall and good looking in a masculine sort of way. She is famed for her knowledge gourmet foods, fine wines, and Epicurean living, and is devoted to her Legion and to the Temple (she used to be a Temple Guard commander before being recruited into the regular Tsolyáni army).

Chángekte hiAmiyála of Thráya – Qón worshiper, Clan Patriarch and Kérdu of the Legion of the Clan of the Golden Sphere, 13 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) Imperial Medium Infantry. He is 47 years old, and is slightly balding, but tall and strong, with wide shoulders. Chángekte has struggled in his military career to be taken seriously, he is actually quite sharp in military matters, but was inexperienced when he was first given command of the legion. He has a quiet demeanor, but those who know him can tell you that he is sharply observant and misses nothing going around him. A student of military strategy and history, he tends to talk about little but military matters.

Mhízhar hiKólsuna – Qón worshiper, Golden Sphere Clan; Senior Dritlán of the Legion of the Clan of the Golden Sphere, 13th Imperial Medium Infantry. 35 years old, he is rigid and stern, and his lack of a sense of humor is proverbial. Slender but wiry and immensely strong, he is prematurely balding, thin-faced, nervous in his mannerisms, and sharp-eyed, noting most of what occurs around him while saying little.

Gagársha hiChúrgushsha of Mmilláka – Qón, Emerald Girdle Clan, 68 years old, Retired Kérdu of the Legion of Gagársha of Mmilláka, 18 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) Imperial Artillery. While elderly, Gagársha is still spry and in great physical shape with a great shock of white hair. His age makes him no longer eligible to lead the legion named for him, but he still mentors the training cohorts and the administration of the legion.

Mengáno hiPayál – Karakán worshiper, White Stone Clan, 39 years old, Senior Dritlán of the Legion of Gagársha of Mmilláka, 18th Imperial Artillery. Actually the senior ranking officer of the legion in Thráya, as while the legion is officially headquartered in Thráya, the active cohorts are stationed at Sokátis. Mengáno handles all of the administrative duties of the legion at headquarters as well as acting as the primary recruiting and logistics agent. He is slender, wiry, and long-faced – not much of a field officer but a good administrator. He is married to a younger man of his clan.

Tlása hiRíshyai – Chiténg worshiper, Red Star Clan, Commandant of the Imperial Arsenal in the Old Fort. Tlása is a tough, seasoned warrior, 58 years old, dark of visage and nearly bald. He is difficult to approach, given to bitter rages, and drinks more than is good for him. His stewardship of the Imperial Arsenal is considered quite good, however.

Kórunme hiTungáqu, Blade Raised High clan, Karákan worshiper, male Dritlán of the Legion of Sérqu Sword of the Empire attached to the Palace of Ever Glorious War in Thráya. Kórunme is 41 years old, only of average height but very well muscled and with extremely handsome features. He is a seasoned bureaucrat and able administrator assigned as a senior recruiter for the various legions. While Kórunme has two husbands elsewhere in the Empire, he is well known for “playing the field” with good looking and interesting men.

**Palace of Foreign Lands**

Jérjin vuMíkkai – Joyous of Vrá clan, Belkhánu Worshiper, 55 years old, Prefect of the Palace of Foreign Lands. Slender and tall, with a friendly demeanor, Jerjin has a sharp sense of humor and is easy with a pun or a joke. Witty and smart (sort of a Vrayáni Oscar Wilde), he is nonetheless an able bureaucrat, is quite familiar with the import and export business and runs his Palace well.

Náru vuKhírsha – Avánthe worshiper, Red Flower clan, Harbormaster. 37 years old, from Vrá, she is pretty, intelligent, and comfortably well off, but sharp-tongued and given to offhand, biting jokes that mainlanders don't understand or think are funny. With her clan connections and her being Vrayáni she is an excellent maritime administrator and keeps the docks running efficiently and as honestly as she can.

Kórkhanu hiVekkúna – Chegárra worshiper, Green Malachite Clan, Captain of the River Police in Thráya. 29 years old, he is rather strong and physically active and proud of his physique and darkly handsome good looks; decisive and pleasant but without much sense of humor, quick to anger, and harbors grudges. He is an excellent pilot and sailor and keeps the river around Thráya safe.

Argóme hiKalónei, Black Stone clan, Hrü’ú, bureaucrat at the Palace of Foreign Lands

Kórumu Vtékh – Thúmis worshiper, Valiant of Ke’ér clan; Yán Koryáni Legate. 42 years old, dashingly handsome, smart, easygoing, funloving and all around a nice guy; he is totally apolitical and perhaps not too devout in a strict sense. While a moderately able diplomat, he has been somewhat out of his depth, protocol-wise, since the arrival of Prince Ulgáis Chná Áld at the great Temple of Belkhánu.

Aryéla Chiúna – The Shadowed One worshiper, Gilded Wing clan, Livyáni Legate. 44 years old, she is the picture of an ascetic: tall, gaunt figure; long, thin face; sharp chin and nose, high cheekbones; and eyes that (due to a physical defect) never look right at the listener, all accentuated by the blue tattoos of a high-status Livyáni. Like most of her countrymen, she seems inscrutable, but is actually quite the scholar of Llyáni times.

Sa’úmush Telká'a – Vimuhla worshiper, Sword of Fire clan, Mu’ugalavyáni Legate. Age 51. Once probably good looking, but age has not been kind to him. He is a seasoned diplomat, however; loyal and tactful, uninventive and perhaps a bit dull. His main interest lies in Mu’ugalavyáni history: diplomatic history, naturally, but also the allegedly thrilling topic of land reforms in the Second and First Palaces.

Gárja Nektómmu – Shiringgayi worshiper, Resounding Wave clan, Salarvyáni Legate. Garja is 55 years old, a big bear of a man, barrel chested, quite hirsute, he has adapted well to Tsolyáni customs and tends to keep his long hair back and clean. He has a jolly smile, and a deep bass laugh that can be heard across the room. He is fond of poetry, especially the bawdy kind, and is a noted collector of rare books.

Ulgáis Chná Áld – High Clan of Ke’ér, Belkhánu Worshiper; The fourth child of the Baron Áld of Yán Kór and Lady Mmír Chná Qayél, sixteen years of age in 2375. Ulgáis is a handsome young man with a keen scholarly mind. He has some slight measure of his father’s stature, being larger of chest and shorter of leg that some, but he may yet grow out of this (he secretly hopes!). He is quite psychically sensitive, to the point of being naturally skilled in magic. He does very well in his studies at the Great Temple of Belkhánu, and is well-liked by his fellow students. He is still somewhat shy around pretty girls his age.

**Clan Masters/Mistresses/Matriarchs**

Sídla hiSúren – Dilinála worshiper, Clan Mistress of the Blue Kirtle Clan in Thráya [architects and builders]. 44 years old, she is artfully pretty, clever, calculating, and has no pity on men but uses her wiles mercilessly to get what she wants. She was well educated in the temple academies and is a well-known building engineer and architect. She has studied most of the ancient building styles, at least in passing, and can usually identify the era of a building by looking at it.

Hóytlan hiKhanúma – Sárku worshiper, Clan Master of the Black Pinnacle Clan in Thráya [craftsmen, masons, builders, woodworkers]. 61 years old, he is short, rotund, bald, and of a reddish complexion.

It is said that he collects coins and gems.

Ásu vuCháresh – Karakán worshiper, Clan Mistress of the Red Flower Clan in Thráya [sailing, shipping and trading]. She is 40 years old, strong, athletic, and interested in seafaring and trade administration since childhood. She is very pretty, though a little heavy by Tsolyáni standards, has a wonderful smile, expressive eyes, and a figure that turns heads on the street. Being Vrayáni, she also has a bubbling, sarcastic sense of humor. Her easygoing, adventurous nature occasionally drives her risks, but always with the financial interests of her clan at heart. She is said to have both male and female lovers.

Bálesh hiKággmodu – Hrü’ü worshiper, Clan Master of the Blazoned Sail Clan in Thráya [sailing, shipping and trading]. 36 years old, he is of heavy build: thick but not fat, with broad features and a mane of coarse black hair.

Kashónu hiTáyantinekh – Chiténg worshiper, Clan Master of the Flat Peak Clan in Thráya. [carpenters, bricklayers, masons], 33 years old, he is not tall but is of heavy, muscular build, with a broken nose and a slash across one cheek that he tells everyone is from the war in Yán Kór but which he really got from a drunken gambler's knife. He is clever, sarcastic, observant, smooth, but with an internal stubborn streak he rose to his current position by being a wiz with accounting.

Jágar hiKadóbar – Hnálla worshiper, Clan Master of the Blue Water Clan in Thráya [foresters, woodworkers]. 52 years old, and despite his age he still has dark black hair and equally dark eyes, but is otherwise an unremarkable man: average height and medium build, and bland facial features. He enjoys an honest wager or a peaceful game of chance and is skilled at many games. Well-spoken and knowledgeable, polite and soft in tone, with a pinch of dry humor in his voice. His mannerisms indicate training in etiquette which suites him well as leader of his clan.

Ógun hiChítesh – Belkhánu worshiper, Clan Master of the Glass Spear Clan in Thráya. [potters, bricklayers, cement-workers, layers of mosaics]. 29 years old, he is very tall for a Tsolyáni, with a powerful build, and quite handsome, although he shaves his head, which is not a frequent Tsolyáni custom. He thus has an ominous appearance, but is actually quite genial, good at bargaining and serves his clan well as its representative. He has never married and is probably a homosexual.

Sokúnu hiBásrim – Wurú worshiper, Clan Master of the Turning Wheel Clan in Thráya [carters and transporters]. 41 years old, he is relatively small and slender, extremely quick, and charmingly handsome, wears his hair short (not often a Tsolyáni custom) and sports a dapper moustache, yet he has a streak of innate cruelty and violence, which has led him into trouble. He is very athletic and loves the out-of-doors, and is often seen working with some of his teamsters around town. He is an able administrator and has an uncanny ability to schedule his transports in the most efficient manner. He is also a connoisseur of fine liqueurs when he can get them.

Miruéne vuDékkomai – Thúmis worshiper, Clan Master of the Joyous of Vrá clan in Thráya. 45 years old, 66 com, 89 charisma, jolly and funny (in that odd Vrayáni way), but this light exterior hides a serious and shrewd businessman, really knows the import/export business inside and out.

Hlígar vuChéka – Hnálla worshiper, Clan Matriarch of the Joyous of Vrá clan in Thráya. At 67 years, Hlígar has seen much of life and is wise about the social workings of the clan. She has seen to the good marriages of many of her clan members and keeps the social calendar of the clan busy appropriately. She is somewhat frail with white hair and a kind face that can make those meeting with her underestimate her shrewd negotiating skills when it comes to the social business of the clan.

Ónmure hiMránu – Chegárra worshiper, 52 years old, Clan Master of the Rising Sun Clan in Thráya. Severe-looking with a hawk-nose, came to be clan master by having dirt on his rivals. A master of secrets and lies.

Naríja hiVorkúma – Avánthe worshiper, Blue Shadow Clan, 33 years old, Grand Mistress of the Blue Shadow Clan in Thráya, 62 com, 51 charisma, pretty, sophisticated, and vapid; she loves gems, cloths, and fun.

Chángekte has struggled in his military career to be taken seriously, he is actually quite sharp in military matters, but was inexperienced when he was first given command of the legion. He has a quiet demeanor, but those who know him can tell you that he is sharply observant and misses nothing going around him. A student of military strategy and history, he tends to talk about little but military matters.

Isúra is a matronly woman of 58, plump, in a pleasing sort of way, rosy cheeks, with hands that have seen work. She is a well-known healer, though now largely retired.

Her one uncommon non-Tlakotáni facial feature is her sloping (NOT hooked) nose. (Note: Ma’ín ALSO had a sloping nose, which is a facial feature found most commonly in Livyánu, and a feature of the woman regarded to be the single greatest beauty of all time, the maid who Marya immortalized in statue during Engsvanyáli times.
