Thraya

The mother temple of Lord Belkhanu's worship, ten to fifteen Tsan outside of Thraya, is the center of Lord Belkhanu's faith. This huge compound extends for a mile from comer to corner, with an extension forming the base of an ell which extends for another half-mile. From the Sakbé road to the temple, the way is clustered with caravanserai, rest houses, amulet sellers, makers of funerary equipment, refreshment vendors, etc., all representatives of lower-middle clans in Thraya and the surrounding agricultural areas.

A tremendous main gate, gilded and adorned with Bednalljan inscription and bas-relief, opens onto a colonnaded outer courtyard. The rows of pillars surround a huge cenotaph with a statue and stele pronouncing Lord Belkhanu's glories. Many doors go off this long colonnaded hall to other halls that lead to outer funerary shrines. Off these are a whole series of auditoriums that have many smaller rooms along their sides, full of funerary workshops, manufacturers, embalmers, and other related facilities.

In this area there are many shrines to the funerary Aspects of Lord Belkhanu . They surround an immense roofed hall, several stories high and illuminated by broad

windows of bronzed glass, where embalmers are trained and embalmings are conducted.

The actual temple is reached from a series of gates beyond the main colonnade that open into another series of halls, an incredibly vast and complex structure. There are gates and palace openings, dormitories and quarters, devoted to various Aspects of the God. Courtyards several stories high are ribbed with the balconies of living areas overlooking gardens and statues. Workshops outside are full of supplies, the Chlén stables, and dormitories of the priests and priestesses who work there.

The architecture is Engsvanyali at its base, with Classical Tsolyani additions and everything in between. The regional southeastern architecture has a predominant tower style of a dome atop a trapezoid, capped with a tall pillar.

A veritable city unto itself, the Temple of Belkhanu draws visitors not only from nearby Thraya but from all over the world. Some come to worship, but many come to simply to view the grandeur of the place, study its art and visit its vast libraries.

Visitors to the temple will often transport water from the courtyard home to dip shrouds, as a shroud dipped in such water is of course more holy. There is a Tsuru'um that is only as old as Engsvan hla Ganga, newer than those that predate Bednalljan times, and lacks the great Bednalljan pyramid tombs of the oldest catacombs. It has its own Necropolis, to which many notable persons arrange to be shipped after death.

It is said that the earliest, private, secret temples of Lord Belkhanu are buried deep beneath the huge mother temple.
