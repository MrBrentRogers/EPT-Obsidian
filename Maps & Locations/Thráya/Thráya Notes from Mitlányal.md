Thráya Notes from Mitlányal

There is a particularly splendid shrine of Lord Hnalla's Thirty-Second Aspect, "The Illuminator of the Dark" a Militant aspect that supports campaigns against the dwellers in lightless places, such as the Worm Lord and his Minions.

There is a major shrine to Lady Avanthe’s First Aspect, Sikkune, an old wise woman, here.

There is a music academy here dedicated to Lady Avanthe’s Thirty-First Aspect, Jogái, “The Songstress”: Patron of music, both vocal and instrumental.

There is a studio and academy here dedicated to Lady Avanthe’s Fiftieth Aspect, Orodhún, “The Paragon of Unimaginable Allure”: Patron of Art, Painting, Sculpture and physical perfection.

There is a scribal school here where calligraphy in many languages and styles is taught dedicated to Lady Avanthe’s Sixtieth Aspect, Weltíga, “The Lady of Scrolls”: Patron of temple administration, records, scribal schools and beautiful calligraphy.

The Eighteenth Aspect of Lord Thúmis is particularly popular in Thráya, Majêr “The Maiden”: symbolizing youthful wisdom, coming of age, and the exploration of one's

world, and beauty.

One of the greatest shrines of Lord Thúmis’ Forty-Sixth Aspect, Meshmúr "The Molder of Flesh; The Healer of Entrails": who heals internal injuries, such as ulcers, cancers, and hemorrhages.

The House of Laying Out the Lands is a part of the Temple of Thúmis in Thráya which collects information from merchants and travelers in order to complete a geography of known areas of Tekumel.

Lord Ba’alán (an aspect of Keténgku) has a major Monastery near the great Temple of Belkhánu run by Lord Keténgku’s “Staff of Mercy Society”. There, those suffering from severe mental illness and disability are cared for and treated by healers, physicians, and apothecaries. Many of these are the very elderly who require care while waiting to embark upon Lord Belkhánu's voyage.

Lady Shomóre (another aspect of Keténgku) devoted to the diseases of women has her main shrine in Thráya. Priestesses come out to attend and lead the woman within for consultation. Her priesthood is largely, but not exclusively, female, with men generally

involved only in administrative functions rather than ritual or scholarly pursuits. Her surgeons are exemplary but, again, only for women's problems such as hysterectomies, breast cancer, and infertility. This Aspect's clergy work closely with their counterparts in

the Temple of Dilinala in Thráya.

The Labyrinth of Arched Glory in the Underworld below Thráya houses one of Lord Qón’s great libraries that is filled with sealed tomes which can never be opened by any but the innermost of Lord Qón’s own inner societies.

The main library of the temple of Qón in Thráya is famed for its specimens of beautiful Engsvanyáli calligraphy, as well as a number of rare historical, mythological, and literary texts in Engsvanyáli and Classical Tsolyáni.

The Temple of Qón in Thráya is also renowned for "The Garden of Artékh," an outdoor astronomical "park" in a walled area just outside the city. Great sundials, towers, and other instruments of stone are used to measure the exact movements of the moons, planets, and other bodies. This was built under the patronage of Governor Artékh hiAmiyála, during the reign of Emperor Métlunel II "the Builder" (1202-1251 A.S.)

Qón’s 12 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) aspect, Ta'ésh, "The Illuminated One," has a major shrine in Thráya.

He is the patron of libraries, ancient languages, and scholarship relating to the Planes Beyond. His worshippers jokingly state that Lord Ta'ésh is of no use whatsoever in practical matters.

An un-numbered but locally important Aspect of Karakán’s is Ajjón the Silver Helm (Over the past millennium this Aspect has gained some prominence, and the priesthood of Thráya have recently petitioned the High Council of the Priesthood to replace Karakán’s 3 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) Aspect, Mikkáshu “The Shield of Scarlet” with Ajjón).

Hriháyal’s 4 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) Aspect, Keyél “From The Tome of Sweet Sounding Beauty”: the patron of singing and music, both erotic and also the classical epic modes, maintains a music Academy in Thráya. She is the one to who mothers pray when their children wish to study music for the first time.

**The Great Temple of Belkhánu**

The mother temple of Lord Belkhánu's worship, ten to fifteen Tsán outside of Thráya, is the center of Belkhánu's faith. This huge compound extends for a mile from comer to corner, with an extension forming an ell that extends for another half-mile. From the Sakbé road to the temple, the way is clustered with caravanserai, rest houses, amulet sellers, makers of funerary equipment, refreshment vendors, etc., all representatives of lower-middle clans in Thráya and the surrounding agricultural areas.

A tremendous main gate, gilded and adorned with Bednálljan inscription and bas-relief, opens onto a colonnaded outer courtyard. The rows of pillars surround a huge cenotaph with a statue and stele pronouncing Lord Belkhánu's glories. Many doors go off this long colonnaded hall to other halls that lead to outer funerary shrines. Off these are a whole series of auditoriums that have many smaller rooms along their sides, full of funerary workshops, manufacturers, embalmers, and other related facilities.

In this area there are many shrines to the funerary Aspects of Lord Belkhánu. They surround an immense roofed hall, several stories high and illuminated by broad

windows of bronzed glass, where embalmers are trained and embalmings are conducted.

The actual temple is reached from a series of gates beyond the main colonnade that open into another series of halls, an incredibly vast and complex structure. There are gates and palace openings, dormitories and quarters, and structures devoted to various Aspects of the God. Courtyards several stories high are ribbed with the balconies of living areas overlooking gardens and statues. Workshops outside are full of supplies, the Chlén stables, and dormitories of the priests who work there.

The architecture is Engsvanyáli at its base, with Tsolyáni additions and everything in between. The regional southeastern architecture has a predominant style of a dome atop a trapezoid, capped with a tall pillar.

A veritable city unto itself, the Temple of Belkhánu draws visitors not only from nearby Thráya but from all over the world. Some come to worship, but many come to simply view the grandeur of the place, and visit its vast libraries.

Visitors to the temple will often transport water from the courtyard home to dip shrouds, as a shroud dipped in such water is of course more holy. There is a Tsuru'úm that is only as old as Éngsvan hlá Gánga, newer than those that predate Bednálljan times, and lacks the great Bednálljan pyramid tombs of the oldest catacombs. It has its own Necropolis, to which many notable persons arrange to be shipped after death.

It is said that the earliest, private, secret temples of Lord Belkhánu are buried deep beneath the huge mother temple.
