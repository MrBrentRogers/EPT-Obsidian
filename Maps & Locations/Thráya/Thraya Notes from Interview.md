Thráya Notes from Interview Tape

The Imperium values Thráya – the clans value Thráya, it’s a great trade city. It guards the river well, though from what (not many threats here). Thráya is built on an alluvial plain so there is no underground river nor a deep underworld as the water table is quite high and keeps flooding and filling in lower levels of the underworld.

The city walls are in fair condition, not great. They couldn't withstand a long siege.

Trade includes wood and timber, pitch, quicklime and agricultural products such as grain and fruits, etc. The Gilráya forest is a source of Chlén,

All of these travel the river.

The Great Temple of Belkhánu sits along the river about 12 tsan to the West, possibly on the site of an earlier Thráya (underworld?). The current city’s location is due to a shift in the river. That earlier Thráya is now gone and the Temple has been kept up and expanded. The Temple is a major source of Pilgrims, which in turn acts as a major source of tourism in Thráya. Businesses that cater to these are common, such as guest houses, manufacturers of chotchkies, clothiers, cobblers, makers of yellow cloth, agricultural clans who feed the pilgrims. A major temple that is a source of Pilgrims is a great source of income for any city. The Temple and the city have a very good relationship. They do their best to please each other.

Thráya is a major commercial center sitting on a major River with major Sakbé Road arteries feeding it. There is not much around Thráya except small agricultural villages catering to the large agricultural economy around Thráya.

The Sakbé roads are grand and in very good repair.

Thráya is one of the most peaceful cities in the empire, as far its inner sociological structure. You have the great clans here, most of them are friendly, or at worst neutral, to the Temple. There are small pockets of antagonism to Belkhánu, such as the Sarku temple etc., but that’s mostly service of the local folk who have happened to have come from somewhere else to settle here. Very few dangers, though they’re always wary of Salarvyá through the Gilráya forest, but there plenty of open land that there were would be plenty of warning if anyone came out of the Gilráya forest.

Avánthe is also big in Thráya, the river, the flow, the crops, the forest. There are animals here, the Gilráya forests are a source for the Chlen, the Tsiel, the large dinosaur-like animal that is used for meat (it is wild and untamable, but is docile and can be penned until ready to be slaughtered; if you’re going to have a huge feast in Béy Sǘ, you are going to need this much meat); Hmélu and Hmá of course work better in dryer areas, so it is not common to fine this meat in Thráya, you have to have it shipped in or go to special dealers where it costs more.

The areas outside the walls are small villages or suburb like areas where for some reason in earlier times were settled by an agricultural group and did not grow much. Often they are a single clan you’ll find the Weeping Pillar, a very small clan running one of the agricultural villages outside of Thráya and everyone there is a member, there are no other clan houses outside of the village.

There is no ‘Chamber of Commerce’ or ‘Tourist Bureau” so a traveler of, for example the White Crystal Clan, would go their clan house and ask to see the sights. They would be informed, to be perfectly honest, that there’s not much to see. There are the walls, the Governor’s Citadel, the old Palace of the Engsvanyáli Governors, which is about as old as it gets.

What is the function of the old palace currently? At the moment nothing, it is an empty and beautiful art object. It stands 7-8 stories tall, roughly oblong in shape and some earlier Tsolyáni Emperor (not the Engsvanyáli) put a kind of a pyramidal peaked roof on the thing and the peaked roof can be seen from all over that area of Thráya. The building itself is now empty, the beautiful Engsvanyáli frescos and carvings are all well preserved, except down low where people have broken them off as souvenirs, the walls higher up are all beautifully decorated with frescos of Engsvanyáli portraits of one of the last Dynasties of Engsvanyáli Priestkings. The Governors of Thráya have kept it good repair. The frescos are highly detailed and it is said that you would need to climb a scaffold to examine the tiny details of each figure that are painted on the ceilings and walls. It is a huge place with several stories and many rooms with staircases that lead up and down at odd levels and ins and outs and suddenly you come on an open balcony and you find yourself looking over the city from this angle, then you go out and around another staircase and you find yourself on a different balcony looking over the city from a different angle and it's a very elaborate place. At one time it was probably a recreation and spa palace for the Engsvanyáli Governors, but it has not been that for a very long time. It was probably used as a fortress in the early days of the Imperium, but that is gone. There are a couple of rooms that are fire damaged, but most of it has been restored and there is a movement to turn it into a museum where you can look at the Engsvanyáli decorations of the past. There are no furnishings, it is completely empty. However, occasionally someone wants to hold a fete in one of the larger chambers, with musical performances or Engsvanyáli poetry, there will be an Engsvanyáli revival where there will be a masque ball where people dress in Engsvanyáli clothing and the Governor and his cohorts will all come around in beautiful dress and pretend it’s Engsvanyáli time once again.

The Great Inn of Detkomé hiMéshnu, Rest house for Foreigners and Visitors of Upper and Noble Status, is a fading and dilapidated glory of the Inn of Detkomé. Detkomé’s Inn was at one time supposed to be one of the major places for stopping on the river and the road from Salarvyá. He had promised the world that he was going to make the place into a super eatery and hostel. The problem he had was that the Salavryani were more interested in food and cheapness than they were in elegance as the Salavryani tend to be a bit mercantile and there was not enough custom to interest the Governors and high Clan folks. His inn is thus a huge rambling place with lots and lots of rooms, some of which are closed, But it’s a good place still, it has excellent food and excellently appointed rooms if you’re wealthy enough to afford it you can live there very comfortably. Even though it is in the foreigner’s quarters, there are many Tsolyáni who stay there (true of all Tsolyáni inns). Most travellers stay at their clan house, temple or barracks if in the military, but if you are a wealthy or high clan traveller with no clan house and don’t want to stay at a temple, the Great Inn is still a very nice place to stay. This large of a guest house typically have various levels of service, depending on a traveller’s status. A Sea Blue traveller would find themselves in an area that would be really beautiful: there would be pools, gardens and crystal and so forth; whereas if you came in and were a member of Ripened Sheaf or something and needed a place to stay it would be less grand.

The Old Fort: in all cities there are fortifications built during times of troubles. Used as the Imperial Arsenal. Part of the Empire of Regetsu of Hnash during the 1623-1699 time of the Usurpers, the Usurper of the South had his hand on this, a very unpleasant business. Sometimes there was civil unrest within the city itself as different factions supported different people. The walls of the old fort are superior to the city walls, but the Governor’s Palace is now considered the current fort. Ditlána die not take down the Old Fort: each building is looked at for it’s historical and religious value prior to being torn down and it’s stability: the Old fort is solidly constructed and in good shape and thus exempt from Ditlána. The places that are typically torn down are the slums, the marketplaces, more dilapidated areas of the temples, government buildings (they want shiny new buildings after all).

The Old Imperial Offices, is a run-down office space used by minor functionaries that are shuffled off to the less grand office spaces. Originally stone, it is now partially constructed of masonry and even wood, the partitions are all wood, and much of this is worn and thin due to years of use. The officers who would be officed here would be the sub-sub-sub members of various departments: taxation, palace of the realm, etc. These are people whose functions are not immediately obvious, they fill in the bureaucratic gaps. These are offices that don’t generally serve the public, they are offices that service other offices.

Prison of Dry Bones: got its name from the fact that they used to expose the bodies of felons in cages over the walls, not a very pleasant thing. It is one of the Imperial prisons that is most in use for lower class prisoners. Prisoners of higher status would be kept over by the Governor’s palace.

Most of the government buildings are in good shape, and center on the square.

The Palace of the Realm is a great big rambling nothing kind of a building with no particular architecture style.

The Hill of Skulls is an Engsvanyáli Ruin, possibly a former pleasure palace of some kind with domes and balconies that is pretty much fallen down now, that gets its name from some carving or frieze of skulls, or perhaps a pile of real skulls, no one today is quite sure. It has a smallish but rather active underworld, with underworld creatures there, it goes down quite a ways, there is some magical stuff there, it is small as underworlds go, but connects by tunnels to other areas of the underworld. It is built on one of the few areas of bedrock in Thráya.

The City of Embalmers is self explanatory, the City of the Dead markers are all from the current empire, and the little domed tombs are all modern copies of earlier Bednálljan tombs. This place is very popular here because of the Belkhánu connection. All of the various Belkhánu clans are represented here. There are several large buildings where the various embalming chemicals are manufactured, the shrouds are woven, grave goods that are buried with the deceased are manufactured (amulets, masks – wood, clay, papier mâché, Chlén-hide, gilded, plain – small figurines, and so forth), and these are sent throughout the empire.

The Isle of Pleasures is an island that is owned and run for the sole purpose of the Temple of Avánthe’s Ritual Girl Festivals (and Girl and Boy Festivals). It has a palace on it that is closed except during festivals when it is reserved for the Governor and his entourage, even if they are not Avánthe worshipers, where they will come out and row a boat and act as the Reopeners of the Path in the spring for The Reopening of the Path 14 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) – 17 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) of Fesul (depending on the moons), where there is a lot of orgies and other sexual experiences during the three day festival. (The Governor doesn’t set foot on the island except during the festival). This festival is popular throughout the empire. People dress in bright blue robes and nothing else, which they discard on arriving at the island. There are the usual fresh casks of wine and fresh casks of local beer that are opened in the spring for this festival. The Temple of Avánthe uses the island regularly during the year for other festivals and rites, it’s just the palace that is used only during the spring festival. The island is not a very well known shrine outside of Thráya, so it doesn’t attract pilgrims from other cities other than for the festival.

The Bednálljan Ruins are possibly Bednálljan Ruins, but may be possibly early Engsvanyáli, the reason no one can tell is that it is simply a pile of tumbled stones, from which the peasantry have been taking stones for centuries to build their houses. There are no decorations on it, no ruins, no walls no buildings, however, there may be something under it. A couple of governors dug shafts into it but they never found anything. The Thráyans say that it was build by some great Bednálljan warlord.

The Temple of Azure was not built as a temple to the gods, but a temple to the Emperor. To get the Priesthoods to agree to it, they had to make it a temple to all 20 of Pavar’s gods and goddesses. They put portrayals of the Emperor in a mask and or in abstract form worshiping all 20 of the gods and goddesses. Currently it is unused for worship, it is only a tourist site, people go there to gawk: there are supposed to be pictures of Emperor Gyésmu without any mask or face covering worshiping the gods and people consider that heretical, so tourists go there to see this. Today are small shrines to each of the gods with a priest where people can go and make a small offering. The Salarvyáni have been petitioning for years to have Shiringgáyi included among the shrines.

The Fortress of the High Lord is a much more recent fortification, build only about 300 years ago by Emperor Gyésmu “The Iron Fist” between 2031 and 2041. It is a real heavy-duty fortress, it is a solid squarish building with very thick high walls, interior of timbered floors and a slate roof over the top. It is heavily garrisoned by the local legions as an imperial garrison fort. It is kept garrisoned and also serves as a secondary armory.

The Hill of Ngán, is a hill that is said to have a monument of some kind on top of it in the shape of a single monolith. The monolith is eroded and weathered beyond recognizing what it may have been a monument to. There may be entrances into the hill and to the underworlds somewhere on the hill. It is also built on one of the areas of bedrock in Thráya.

The Palace and Library were originally built by one of the Governors of Thráya to house some of his sons and daughters that he didn’t like. One of the children was interested in scholarship and collected a library of some small note. While not a formal school, scholars do congregate there. It is owned by the imperium. It is now a small library used by the Nobility and the Priesthoods and specializes in the history of the city of Thráya and of the ecology and natural history in and around Thráya. This includes a collection of rare woods from the Gilráya Forest. There are also many volumes in Salarvyáni.

High Tower of Suerá was possibly originally a temple to one of the gods (but no one knows which one), but it now stands empty except for the city wall guard post. It is highly defensible, self-contained, has its own gates and doors, with thick walls and tiny little chambers, and at the top, seven stories up, it has larger more comfortable rooms with larger windows. It is now imperial property. (There is rumored to be an underworld entrance in the tower.)

Palace of Foreign Lands is small and unimportant. Only there for customs duty on items coming up river.

The Foreigner’s Quarters is typical of any large city in Tsolyánu: hostels, shops, etc. It has it own gates, and while there are some better and even nice hostels, the majority of it is slums.

There is more than one slave market, some for agricultural and menial slaves, another for household and specialty slaves, another for nonhuman slaves.

The Hirilákte Arena in Thráya is small but still well used.

The upper class shops in and around Market Square will ‘knock your sox off’. The best armor, fancy jewels, etc. The Salarvyáni items available here are wonderful. The woodworked stuff from the forest is beautiful, carvings, furniture, etc.

The Old Palace was built by one of the previous emperors, probably Metlunél II “The Builder”. It is a warren of elaborate rooms and chambers, slightly in a Salarvyáni style, unpleasantly gaudy and very, very ornate: towers and domes and cupolas and little bulbs and things sticking up off the roof; it is not now a place where people live, it is now used for offices of the various departments of the Thráyan bureaucracy.

The Temple of Thúmis includes a large garden complex.

Plaza of Monuments includes rows of statues of costumed males and females. The interesting thing is that each ‘Monument’ consists of three statues, each of two males with a female in the middle or two females with a male in the middle, and nobody knows why. These are elaborately costumed and beautifully dressed and coifed in one of the earliest Classical Tsolyáni styles. There are no special rituals or festivals regarding the statues, nobody really knows anything about them. They are still in very good shape and are well maintained by the government of Thráya. They are on large plinths and stand over 25’ high, so are pretty safe from vandals.

The Square of Statues has modern statues of well-known governors, and other local people of note. This tries to duplicate the monuments of old but doesn’t really fool anyone as to the quality.

Potential underworld entrances: beneath the Hill of Skulls, beneath the Engsvanyáli palace in the center of the city, probably beneath the High Tower of Suerá, the underworld here is not very deep as the alluvial plain keeps flooding and filling in lower levels of the underworld.

The Bridge of Hakuór is a bridge that crosses the river. In the center of the bridge you can go down to a small island that has a square pavilion-like building surrounded by an open platform with marble benches and a balustrade around it where people gather to have a nice picnic, to talk, or to simply pass a pleasant afternoon. Vendors sell roasted meats (gregresha) and vegetables, pleasant drinks, and so forth.

Bay of Kúrun Tlaáno is the main commercial harbor where the majority of river commerce takes place. The major warehouses also have their own short wharves where one or two ships can land at a time. Passenger wharves are by the Plaza of Monuments. The Temple of Belkhánu also has its own wharves where the bodies of the dead arrive for the funerary rites, and the funerary manufactured goods are shipped up and down the river to other parts of the empire. There is no military or formal Imperial harbor. There are all kinds of interesting items that can be picked up in the shops along the wharves, Salarvyáni goods, including the black Salarvyáni wine.

The governor’s palace has the prison for more serious offenders buried beneath the palace.

The three legions that are headquartered in Thráya are all located next to The Palace of Ever-Glorious War: The Legion of Gagársha of Mmillaka, 18th Imperial Artillery, The Cohorts of Lord Chegárra, the Hero King, 12th Imperial Medium Infantry (whose patron is the Temple of Chegárra) and The Legion of the Clan of the Golden Sphere, 13th Imperial Medium Infantry (all Qón worshipers). The City Guard barracks is also nearby.

An interesting note is that the headquarters of The Cohorts of Lord Chegárra, the Hero King, 12th Imperial Medium Infantry has five great sailing ships in it. When Durumu “the Copper Blade of Sarku” ordered the legion disbanded, the Temple of Chegarra resisted and managed to “lose” the entire Legion in the wilds of the Chayengar Range, where it continued to receive secret support from its priesthood. When Nrainue “the Iridescent Goddess” came to the Petal Throne, the Legion emerged from its hiding place and reported that it had “sailed the Dry Bay of Ssu’um in the service of the Imperium.” This Empress, not terribly well versed in geography, commanded that it be given “ships for further exploration of that region,” and to this day in the Legion headquarters one can see the five great ships ordered built by the Empress, ships which have never touched water. These are carefully maintained, sails and all, in complete readiness for the carrying out of the Imperial order. No such order ever came, of course.

The slums east and south of the city walls are appalling and the governor has been threatening to tear them down for some time now.

Thráya is overdue for Ditlána. The Imperium will tell you that Ditlána doesn’t cost anything but calling in favors of the clans and temples. Prince Rereshqála recommended Ditlána during the war with Yán Kór and now that he is the High Chancellor, the paperwork is almost certainly in process. It is a lot more run-down than say Usananu (which is quite lovely).

The Dowager Empress (Hirkáne’s mother) was in retirement not far from the Great Temple of Belkhánu. Her small palace is in a forested area on the road between Rereshqála’s Palace outside of Jakálla and the Great Temple. It is magically hidden from the road and only those who know the correct magical gestures can open the illusion covering the guarded door.

The people of Thráya tend to be more solid, fairer, and stocky than further west. Also, those with Salarvyáni blood will be more sallow, with blue-black hair, and the men will be hairier with longer beards.
