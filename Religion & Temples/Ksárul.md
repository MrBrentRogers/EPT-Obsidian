**Demonology**
Several demon species serve the Doomed Prince, the commonest being the Dwellers in Shadow, a race of shaggy, blue-grey, spider-like, 2 m tall creatures who smell like rotting meat mixed with vinegar . They fight with sawtoothed one-handed long swords of "enchanted" steel and have 2 chances to hit each round (using two of their eight limbs to fight). If they hit, they do damage according to table C . They bargain for anything blue, preferring blue gems but occasionally settling for blue lacquered armour or even blue cloth!

Ksárul's Cohort, Gruginu, is served by a different race : the Azure Denizens . These are flat, amoebalike, indigo-hued creatures 2.5 m in diametre. They have no weapons but roll over their victims, doing damage according to table G if they score a hit . An opponent subtracts - 3 from his/her Combat Values when fighting them . They are vulnerable to fire and have a 30 percent chance of being set ablaze by a torch, lamp, or other burning object . They are also driven away by the Vapour of Death (no . 69) . The Denizens bargain only for the sacrifice of 1-5 (randomly rolled) intelligent beings of any species . This must be performed for them before they will undertake any task .
