Who Wrote The Book of Ebon Bindings ?  
I have read The Book of Ebon Bindings in order to consider not the demons, but the grimoire’s wizard author himself. The wizard appears to have written the tome just before his disappearance from the city of Purdánim sometime close to the Fall of the Kingdom of the Gods. He shared his epoch with the famous poet Yetíl, known from EPT, and also the wizard Turshánmy (with whom the author has doctrinal disagreements).  
The wizard strikes me as tragically concerned with reputation. His book on black (i.e., dark magic) binding rituals was penned in the hope that his reputation might survive his vanishment for “a century or two”.  
“Be FAMED throughout the Halls of the Eons for your wisdom!” he cries out to his readers.  
“Wisdom” here refers to knowledge “of the Powers and the Ways”. In the ritual of summoning Gereshmá΄a, there are mentioned “Five Words of Power and the One More”, “that formula of dispelling known to all of those of the fifteenth circle or higher” and “the Pattern of the Primordial Nexus”. These are examples of “the Ways”.  
It appears that high sorcery was already in decline in the author’s lifetime. “Wisdom” was a thing achieved by “the sorcerers and necromancers of old”. In the author’s day, rituals and sorcerous diagrams “contained in themselves great dangers”. Of old, “secret books inscribed with special calling and binding spells” were produced (a reference to the Dorún Duqálu Tóru'una in EPT), but in the author’s lifetime, even the prior title is no longer known.  
Known titles of sorcerous manuals lost by the author’s lifetime include Realms Beyond the Triple Knot, The Scroll of Inimical Sendings, The Book of Webbed Transitions and The Book of Burnings.  
The wizard author, nevertheless, appears to be a “mage of mages”, one who holds the Pallid Effluvium of Bù-Tlátme, the Golden Key of Vayunámu, and The Protective Pandects of Nì-Tirishké. He is one who has made demons “amenable to [his] bidding”. In his fifties, the wizard summoned the demon prince Gereshmá΄a. He opines in such a way as to suggest Srykárum is one of his invocations. The summoner has several times called the fire warder Lord Tkél. He has also evoked the water demon Gashténe (or at least seems to have, for he sites no written sources but rather speaks as though from experience), the defence demon Chríya, and possibly Ashónu, Missúm, Zanátl and others.  
Disparate clues throughout The Book of Ebon Bindings indicate to me that the author is none other than Súbadim the Sorcerer. The author speaks intimately of the Wands of Puesmány (the making of which is explained in Realms Beyond the Triple Knot). This latter book is NEVER cited directly by the wizard author, as if citation were unneeded. The name of Súbadim is, lastly, added to and erased from the manuscript in suggestive ways.
